However the description of it found in Gen. 6 through 8 makes this patently absurd. If it was local, Noah had 120 years to migrate out of the area to safe ground! Why waste all that effort building a ship? He only had to move less than 1500 feet a day to reach the farthest point on the globe! With the possible exception of Ps 29:10, this word always refers to Noah's flood. The real reason for insisting on a local flood is the acceptance of evolution with its long geological ages. Most holding that view are not willing to allow a global world wide flood to have happened less than 5000 years ago. To admit such eliminates the need for the geological ages for most of the geological column would have been rapidly laid down by Noah's flood.

8675 Kethiv Readings In the Hebrew Bible, the scribes did not alter any text they felt had been copied incorrectly. Rather they noted in the margin what they thought the written text should be. The written variation is called a kethiv and the marginal note is called the qere. Where the translators of the Authorised Version followed the qere reading rather than the kethiv, we indicate the kethiv reading by the number 08675. For example, in Ge 24:33 "was set" is coded as H07760 08675 H03455 . The translators used the qere reading that has Strong's number H07760 but the kethiv reading is Strong's number H03455 . Both words have the same meaning, "was set".
8676 Qere Readings In the Hebrew Bible, the scribes did not alter any text they felt had been copied incorrectly. Rather they noted in the margin what they thought the written text should be. The written variation is called a kethiv and the marginal note is called the qere. Where the translators of the Authorised Version followed the kethiv reading rather than the qere, we indicate the qere reading by the number 08676. For example, in De 19:6 "blood" is coded as H01818 08676 H05315 . The translators followed the kethiv reading that has Strong's number H01818 , which means "blood", but the qere reading is Strong's number H05315 , which means "life".
8677 Synonym Strong's Numbers Sometimes, a word or phrase has individual Strong's numbers assigned to it and it has an additional Strong's number for the entire phrase. In Jud 20:18 the phrase "house of God" is coded as "house < H01004 > of God < H0430 > <08677> < H01008 >" In this case the phrase could also mean place Bethel which has the Strong's number H01008 . Only by context can you distinguish proper names in Hebrew from individual words. Hence translators do arrive at different renderings for the same Hebrew.
8678 Multiple Qere Readings for a Kethiv There are several marginal or qere readings for a kethiv reading. In Ne 5:7 the word "exact" is coded as "exact < H05378 > < H08778 > < H05383 > < H08675 > < H05375 >". The two marginal readings, Strong's numbers H05378 and H05383 exist for the one kethiv reading H05375 . 08679

8810 Imperative This verb class indicates an order or a command. Go up to the city. Wash yourself.
8811 Imperfect The imperfect expresses an action, process or condition which is incomplete, and it has a wide range of meaning: 1a) It is used to describe a single (as opposed to a repeated) action in the past; it differs from the perfect in being more vivid and pictorial. The perfect expresses the "fact", the imperfect adds colour and movement by suggesting the "process" preliminary to its completion. he put forth his hand to the door it came to a halt I began to hear 1b) A phrase such as "What seekest thou?", refers not only to the present, but assumes that the search has continued for some time. Why do you weep? Why refuse to eat? Why are you distressed? These relate not so much as to one occasion, as to a continued condition. 2) The kind of progression or imperfection and unfinished condition of the action may consist in its frequent repetition. 2a) In the present: it is "said" today a wise son "maketh glad" his father 2b) In the past: "and so he did" - regularly, year by year a mist "used to go up" the fish which "we used to eat" the manna "came down" -regularly he "spoke" -repeatedly 3) The imperfect is used to express the "future", referring not only to an action which is about to be accomplished but one which has not yet begun: 3a) This may be a future from the point of view of the real present; as: Now "shalt thou see what I will do" "We will burn" thy house 3b) It may be a future from any other point of view assumed; as: he took his son that "was to reign" she stayed to see what "should be done" 4) The usage of 3b may be taken as the transitive to a common use of the imperfect in which it serves for an expression of those shades of relation among acts and thoughts for which English prefers the conditional moods. Such actions are strictly "future" in reference to the assumed point of relation, and the simple imperfect sufficiently expresses them; e.g. of every tree thou "mayest eat" "could we know" he "would" say 5a) The imperfect follows particles expressing "transition", "purpose", "result" and so forth as, "in order that", "lest"; e.g. say thou art my sister, "that it may be well with thee" let us deal wisely with the nation, "lest it multiplies" 5b) When however there is a strong feeling of "purpose", or when it is meant to be strongly marked, then of course the moods are employed; e.g. raise me up "that I may requite them" who will entice Ahab "that he may go up" what shall we do "that the sea may be calm" The moods are also employed to express that class of future actions which we express in the "optative" "may I die" "may" the LORD "establish" his word "may" the child "live"
8812 Infinitive There are two forms of the infinitive: 1a) Infinitive Construct is used as a verbal noun corresponding to the English verbal noun ending in "- ing" 1a1) as subject to keep the judgments to seek thy heart 1a2) as object in his "writing" he spoke, "saying" 1b) The Infinitive Absolute does not allow prefixes or suffixes 1b1) Used with a verb to emphasize the verbal idea. This is often rendered by an English adverb, such as, "surely", "utterly". he will surely visit you he utterly destroyed the people 1b2) It may be used by itself with the value of a finite form of the verb, especially an imperative. remember the sabbath day
8813 Participle 1) The participle represents an action or condition in its unbroken continuity, and corresponds to the English verb, "to be" with the present participle. It may be used of present, past or future time. 1a) present time what are you doing 1b) past time "he was still speaking" when another came 1c) future time we are destroying-e.g. are about to destroy
8814 Participle Active Active form of the participle. See H08813 for description of participle.
8815 Participle Passive Passive form of the participle. See H08813 for description of participle.
8816 Perfect The Perfect expresses a completed action. 1) In reference to time, such an action may be: 1a) one just completed from the standpoint of the present "I have come" to tell you the news 1b) one completed in the more or less distant past in the beginning God "created" "I was (once) young" and "I have (now) grown old" but "I have not seen" a righteous man forsaken 1c) one already completed from the point of view of another past act God saw everything that "he had made" 1d) one completed from the point of view of another action yet future I will draw for thy camels also until "they have done" drinking 2) The perfect is often used where the present is employed in English. 2a) in the case of general truths or actions of frequent occurrence--truths or actions which have been often experienced or observed the grass "withereth" the sparrow "findeth" a house 2b) an action or attitude of the past may be continued into the present "I stretch out" my hands to thee "thou never forsakest" those who seek thee 2c) the perfect of intransitive verbs is used where English uses the present; The perfect in Hebrew in such a case emphasises a condition which has come into "complete existence" and realisation "I know" thou wilt be king "I hate" all workers of iniquity 2d) Sometimes in Hebrew, future events are conceived so vividly and so realistically that they are regarded as having virtually taken place and are described by the perfect. 2d1) in promises, threats and language of contracts the field "give I" thee and if not, "I will take it" 2d2) prophetic language my people "is gone into captivity" (i.e. shall assuredly go)
