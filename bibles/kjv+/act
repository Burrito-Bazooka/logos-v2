1:1 The former 3303 4413 treatise 3056 have I made 4160 5668, O 5599 Theophilus 2321, of 4012 all 3956 that Jesus 2424 began 756 5662 both 5037 to do 4160 5721 and 2532 teach 1321 5721, 

1:2 Until 891 the day 2250 in which 3739 he was taken up 353 5681, after that he through 1223 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 had given commandments 1781 5674 unto the apostles 652 whom 3739 he had chosen 1586 5668: 

1:3 To whom 3739 also 2532 he shewed 3936 5656 himself 1438 alive 2198 5723 after 3326 his 846 passion 3958 5629 by 1722 many 4183 infallible proofs 5039, being seen 3700 5740 of them 846 1223 forty 5062 days 2250, and 2532 speaking 3004 5723 of the things pertaining 4012 to the kingdom 932 of God 2316: 

1:4 And 2532, being assembled together 4871 5740 with 846 [them], commanded 3853 5656 them 846 that they should 5563 0 not 3361 depart 5563 5745 from 575 Jerusalem 2414, but 235 wait 4037 5721 for the promise 1860 of the Father 3962, which 3739, [saith he], ye have heard 191 5656 of me 3450. 

1:5 For 3754 John 2491 truly 3303 baptized 907 5656 with water 5204; but 1161 ye 5210 shall be baptized 907 5701 with 1722 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 not 3756 many 3326 4183 days 2250 hence 5025. 

1:6 When 3303 they therefore 3767 were come together 4905 5631, they asked 1905 5707 of him 846, saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962, 1487 wilt thou 600 0 at 1722 this 5129 time 5550 restore again 600 5719 the kingdom 932 to Israel 2474? 

1:7 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, It is 2076 5748 not 3756 for you 5216 to know 1097 5629 the times 5550 or 2228 the seasons 2540, which 3739 the Father 3962 hath put 5087 5639 in 1722 his own 2398 power 1849. 

1:8 But 235 ye shall receive 2983 5695 power 1411, after that the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 is come 1904 5631 upon 1909 you 5209: and 2532 ye shall be 2071 5704 witnesses 3144 unto me 3427 both 5037 in 1722 Jerusalem 2419, and 2532 in 1722 all 3956 Judaea 2449, and 2532 in Samaria 4540, and 2532 unto 2193 the uttermost part 2078 of the earth 1093. 

1:9 And 2532 when he had spoken 2036 5631 these things 5023, while they 846 beheld 991 5723, he was taken up 1869 5681; and 2532 a cloud 3507 received 5274 5627 him 846 out of 575 their 846 sight 3788. 

1:10 And 2532 while 5613 they looked stedfastly 2258 5713 816 5723 toward 1519 heaven 3772 as he 846 went up 4198 5740, 2532 behold 2400 5628, two 1417 men 435 stood by 3936 5715 them in 1722 white 3022 apparel 2066; 

1:11 Which 3739 also 2532 said 2036 5627, Ye men 435 of Galilee 1057, why 5101 stand ye 2476 5758 gazing up 1689 5723 into 1519 heaven 3772? this same 3778 Jesus 2424, which 3588 is taken up 353 5685 from 575 you 5216 into 1519 heaven 3772, shall 2064 0 so 3779 come 2064 5695 in like manner as 5158 ye have seen 2300 5662 him 846 go 4198 5740 into 1519 heaven 3772. 

1:12 Then 5119 returned they 5290 5656 unto 1519 Jerusalem 2419 from 575 the mount 3735 called 2564 5746 Olivet 1638, which 3739 is 2076 5748 from 1451 Jerusalem 2419 a sabbath 4521 day's journey 2192 5723 3598. 

1:13 And 2532 when 3753 they were come in 1525 5627, they went up 305 5627 into 1519 an upper room 5253, where 3757 abode 2258 5713 2650 5723 both 5037 Peter 4074, and 2532 James 2385, and 2532 John 2491, and 2532 Andrew 406, Philip 5376, and 2532 Thomas 2381, Bartholomew 918, and 2532 Matthew 3156, James 2385 [the son] of Alphaeus 256, and 2532 Simon 4613 Zelotes 2208, and 2532 Judas 2455 [the brother] of James 2385. 

1:14 These 3778 all 3956 continued 2258 5713 4342 5723 with one accord 3661 in prayer 4335 and 2532 supplication 1162, with 4862 the women 1135, and 2532 Mary 3137 the mother 3384 of Jesus 2424, and 2532 with 4862 his 846 brethren 80. 

1:15 And 2532 in 1722 those 5025 days 2250 Peter 4074 stood up 450 5631 in 1722 the midst 3319 of the disciples 3101, and said 2036 5627, 5037 (the number 3793 of names 3686 together 1909 846 were 2258 5713 about 5613 an hundred 1540 and twenty 1501) 

1:16 Men 435 [and] brethren 80, this 5026 scripture 1124 must 1163 5713 needs have been fulfilled 4137 5683, which 3739 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 by 1223 the mouth 4750 of David 1138 spake before 4277 5627 concerning 4012 Judas 2455, which 3588 was 1096 5637 guide 3595 to them that took 4815 5631 Jesus 2424. 

1:17 For 3754 he was 2258 5713 numbered 2674 5772 with 4862 us 2254, and 2532 had obtained 2975 5627 part 2819 of this 5026 ministry 1248. 

1:18 Now 3303 3767 this man 3778 purchased 2932 5662 a field 5564 with 1537 the reward 3408 of iniquity 93; and 2532 falling 1096 5637 headlong 4248, he burst asunder 2997 5656 in the midst 3319, and 2532 all 3956 his 846 bowels 4698 gushed out 1632 5681. 

1:19 And 2532 it was 1096 5633 known 1110 unto all 3956 the dwellers 2730 5723 at Jerusalem 2419; insomuch as 5620 that 1565 field 5564 is called 2564 5683 in their 846 proper 2398 tongue 1258, Aceldama 184, that 5123 5748 is to say, The field 5564 of blood 129. 

1:20 For 1063 it is written 1125 5769 in 1722 the book 976 of Psalms 5568, Let 1096 0 his 846 habitation 1886 be 1096 5676 desolate 2048, and 2532 let 2077 5749 no man 3361 dwell 2730 5723 therein 1722 846: and 2532 his 846 bishoprick 1984 let 2983 0 another 2087 take 2983 5630. 

1:21 Wherefore 3767 of these 5130 men 435 which have companied 4905 5631 with us 2254 all 3956 the time 5550 that 1722 3739 the Lord 2962 Jesus 2424 went 1831 0 in 1525 5627 and 2532 out 1831 5627 among 1909 us 2248, 

1:22 Beginning 756 5671 from 575 the baptism 908 of John 2491, unto 2193 that same day 2250 that 3739 he was taken up 353 5681 from 575 us 2257, must 1163 5748 one 1520 be ordained 1096 5635 to be a witness 3144 with 4862 us 2254 of his 846 resurrection 386. 

1:23 And 2532 they appointed 2476 5627 two 1417, Joseph 2501 called 2564 5746 Barsabas 923, who 3739 was surnamed 1941 5681 Justus 2459, and 2532 Matthias 3159. 

1:24 And 2532 they prayed 4336 5666, and said 2036 5627, Thou 4771, Lord 2962, which knowest the hearts 2589 of all 3956 [men], shew 322 5657 whether 1520 of 1537 these 5130 two 1417 thou hast chosen 1586 5668, 

1:25 That he may take 2983 5629 part 2819 of this 5026 ministry 1248 and 2532 apostleship 651, from 1537 which 3739 Judas 2455 by transgression fell 3845 5627, that he might go 4198 5677 to 1519 his own 2398 place 5117. 

1:26 And 2532 they gave forth 1325 5656 their 846 lots 2819; and 2532 the lot 2819 fell 4098 5627 upon 1909 Matthias 3159; and 2532 he was numbered 4785 5681 with 3326 the eleven 1733 apostles 652. 

2:1 And 2532 when 1722 the day 2250 of Pentecost 4005 was fully come 4845 5745, they were 2258 5713 all 537 with one accord 3661 in 1909 one place 846. 

2:2 And 2532 suddenly 869 there came 1096 5633 a sound 2279 from 1537 heaven 3772 as 5618 of a rushing 5342 5730 mighty 972 wind 4157, and 2532 it filled 4137 5656 all 3650 the house 3624 where 3757 they were 2258 5713 sitting 2521 5740. 

2:3 And 2532 there appeared 3700 5681 unto them 846 cloven 1266 5730 tongues 1100 like as 5616 of fire 4442, and 5037 it sat 2523 5656 upon 1909 each 1538 1520 of them 846. 

2:4 And 2532 they were 4130 0 all 537 filled 4130 5681 with the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, and 2532 began 756 5662 to speak with 2980 5721 other 2087 tongues 1100, as 2531 the Spirit 4151 gave 1325 5707 them 846 utterance 669 5738. 

2:5 And 1161 there were 2258 5713 dwelling 2730 5723 at 1722 Jerusalem 2419 Jews 2453, devout 2126 men 435, out of 575 every 3956 nation 1484 under 5259 heaven 3772. 

2:6 Now 1161 when this 5026 was 1096 5637 noised abroad 5456, the multitude 4128 came together 4905 5627, and 2532 were confounded 4797 5681, because 3754 that every 1538 man 1520 heard 191 5707 them 846 speak 2980 5723 in his own 2398 language 1258. 

2:7 And 1161 they were 1839 0 all 3956 amazed 1839 5710 and 2532 marvelled 2296 5707, saying 3004 5723 one to another 4314 240, Behold 2400 5628, are 1526 5748 not 3756 all 3956 these 3778 which 3588 speak 2980 5723 Galilaeans 1057? 

2:8 And 2532 how 4459 hear 191 5719 we 2249 every 1538 man in our 2257 own 2398 tongue 1258, wherein 1722 3739 we were born 1080 5681? 

2:9 Parthians 3934, and 2532 Medes 3370, and 2532 Elamites 1639, and 2532 the dwellers 2730 5723 in Mesopotamia 3318, and 5037 in Judaea 2449, and 2532 Cappadocia 2587, in Pontus 4195, and 2532 Asia 773, 

2:10 5037 Phrygia 5435, and 5037 2532 Pamphylia 3828, in Egypt 125, and 2532 in the parts 3313 of Libya 3033 about 2596 Cyrene 2957, and 2532 strangers 1927 5723 of Rome 4514, 5037 Jews 2453 and 5037 2532 proselytes 4339, 

2:11 Cretes 2912 and 2532 Arabians 690, we do hear 191 5719 them 846 speak 2980 5723 in our 2251 tongues 1100 the wonderful works 3167 of God 2316. 

2:12 And 1161 they were 1839 0 all 3956 amazed 1839 5710, and 2532 were in doubt 1280 5707, saying 3004 5723 one 243 to 4314 another 243, What 5101 meaneth 2309 5722 302 1511 5750 this 5124? 

2:13 1161 Others 2087 mocking 5512 5723 said 3004 5707, 3754 These men are 1526 5748 full 3325 5772 of new wine 1098. 

2:14 But 1161 Peter 4074, standing up 2476 5685 with 4862 the eleven 1733, lifted up 1869 5656 his 848 voice 5456, and 2532 said 669 5662 unto them 846, Ye men 435 of Judaea 2453, and 2532 all 537 [ye] that dwell 2730 5723 at Jerusalem 2419, be 2077 5749 this 5124 known 1110 unto you 5213, and 2532 hearken 1801 5663 to my 3450 words 4487: 

2:15 For 1063 these 3778 are 3184 0 not 3756 drunken 3184 5719, as 5613 ye 5210 suppose 5274 5719, seeing 1063 it is 2076 5748 [but] the third 5154 hour 5610 of the day 2250. 

2:16 But 235 this 5124 is 2076 5748 that which was spoken 2046 5772 by 1223 the prophet 4396 Joel 2493; 

2:17 And 2532 it shall come to pass 2071 5704 in 1722 the last 2078 days 2250, saith 3004 5719 God 2316, I will pour out 1632 5692 of 575 my 3450 Spirit 4151 upon 1909 all 3956 flesh 4561: and 2532 your 5216 sons 5207 and 2532 your 5216 daughters 2364 shall prophesy 4395 5692, and 2532 your 5216 young men 3495 shall see 3700 5695 visions 3706, and 2532 your 5216 old men 4245 shall dream 1798 dreams 1797 5701: 

2:18 And 2532 1065 on 1909 my 3450 servants 1401 and 2532 on 1909 my 3450 handmaidens 1399 I will pour out 1632 5692 in 1722 those 1565 days 2250 of 575 my 3450 Spirit 4151; and 2532 they shall prophesy 4395 5692: 

2:19 And 2532 I will shew 1325 5692 wonders 5059 in 1722 heaven 3772 above 507, and 2532 signs 4592 in 1909 the earth 1093 beneath 2736; blood 129, and 2532 fire 4442, and 2532 vapour 822 of smoke 2586: 

2:20 The sun 2246 shall be turned 3344 5691 into 1519 darkness 4655, and 2532 the moon 4582 into 1519 blood 129, before 2228 4250 that great 3173 and 2532 notable 2016 day 2250 of the Lord 2962 come 2064 5629: 

2:21 And 2532 it shall come to pass 2071 5704, [that] whosoever 3739 3956 302 shall call on 1941 5672 the name 3686 of the Lord 2962 shall be saved 4982 5701. 

2:22 Ye men 435 of Israel 2475, hear 191 5657 these 5128 words 3056; Jesus 2424 of Nazareth 3480, a man 435 approved 584 5772 of 575 God 2316 among 1519 you 5209 by miracles 1411 and 2532 wonders 5059 and 2532 signs 4592, which 3739 God 2316 did 4160 5656 by 1223 him 846 in 1722 the midst 3319 of you 5216, as 2531 ye yourselves 846 also 2532 know 1492 5758: 

2:23 Him 5126, being delivered 1560 by the determinate 3724 5772 counsel 1012 and 2532 foreknowledge 4268 of God 2316, ye have taken 2983 5631, and by 1223 wicked 459 hands 5495 have crucified 4362 5660 and slain 337 5627: 

2:24 Whom 3739 God 2316 hath raised up 450 5656, having loosed 3089 5660 the pains 5604 of death 2288: because 2530 it was 2258 5713 not 3756 possible 1415 that he 846 should be holden 2902 5745 of 5259 it 846. 

2:25 For 1063 David 1138 speaketh 3004 5719 concerning 1519 him 846, I foresaw 4308 5710 the Lord 2962 always 1223 3956 before 1799 my 3450 face, for 3754 he is 2076 5748 on 1537 my 3450 right hand 1188, that 2443 I should 4531 0 not 3363 be moved 4531 5686: 

2:26 Therefore 1223 5124 did 2165 0 my 3450 heart 2588 rejoice 2165 5681, and 2532 my 3450 tongue 1100 was glad 21 5662; moreover 1161 2089 also 2532 my 3450 flesh 4561 shall rest 2681 5692 in 1909 hope 1680: 

2:27 Because 3754 thou wilt 1459 0 not 3756 leave 1459 5692 my 3450 soul 5590 in 1519 hell 86, neither 3761 wilt thou suffer 1325 5692 thine 4675 Holy One 3741 to see 1492 5629 corruption 1312. 

2:28 Thou hast made known 1107 5656 to me 3427 the ways 3598 of life 2222; thou shalt make 4137 0 me 3165 full 4137 5692 of joy 2167 with 3326 thy 4675 countenance 4383. 

2:29 Men 435 [and] brethren 80, let 2036 0 me 1832 5752 freely 3326 3954 speak 2036 5629 unto 4314 you 5209 of 4012 the patriarch 3966 David 1138, that 3754 he is 5053 0 both 2532 dead 5053 5656 and 2532 buried 2290 5648, and 2532 his 846 sepulchre 3418 is 2076 5748 with 1722 us 2254 unto 891 this 5026 day 2250. 

2:30 Therefore 3767 being 5225 5723 a prophet 4396, and 2532 knowing 1492 5761 that 3754 God 2316 had sworn 3660 5656 with an oath 3727 to him 846, that of 1537 the fruit 2590 of his 846 loins 3751, according to 2596 the flesh 4561, he would raise up 450 5693 Christ 5547 to sit 2523 5658 on 1909 his 846 throne 2362; 

2:31 He seeing this before 4275 5631 spake 2980 5656 of 4012 the resurrection 386 of Christ 5547, that 3754 his 846 soul 5590 was 2641 0 not 3756 left 2641 5681 in 1519 hell 86, neither 3761 his 846 flesh 4561 did see 1492 5627 corruption 1312. 

2:32 This 5126 Jesus 2424 hath 450 0 God 2316 raised up 450 5656, whereof 3739 we 2249 all 3956 are 2070 5748 witnesses 3144. 

2:33 Therefore 3767 being 5312 0 by the right hand 1188 of God 2316 exalted 5312 5685, and 5037 having received 2983 5631 of 3844 the Father 3962 the promise 1860 of the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, he hath shed forth 1632 5656 this 5124, which 3739 ye 5210 now 3568 see 991 5719 and 2532 hear 191 5719. 

2:34 For 1063 David 1138 is not 3756 ascended 305 5627 into 1519 the heavens 3772: but 1161 he saith 3004 5719 himself 846, The LORD 2962 said 2036 5627 unto my 3450 Lord 2962, Sit thou 2521 5737 on 1537 my 3450 right hand 1188, 

2:35 Until 2193 I make 302 5087 5632 thy 4675 foes 2190 thy 4675 footstool 4228 5286. 

2:36 Therefore 3767 let 1097 0 all 3956 the house 3624 of Israel 2474 know 1097 5720 assuredly 806, that 3754 God 2316 hath made 4160 5656 that same 5126 Jesus 2424, whom 3739 ye 5210 have crucified 4717 5656, both 2532 Lord 2962 and 2532 Christ 5547. 

2:37 Now 1161 when they heard 191 5660 [this], they were pricked 2660 5648 in their heart 2588, and 5037 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 Peter 4074 and 2532 to the rest 3062 of the apostles 652, Men 435 [and] brethren 80, what 5101 shall we do 4160 5692? 

2:38 Then 1161 Peter 4074 said 5346 5713 unto 4314 them 846, Repent 3340 5657, and 2532 be baptized 907 5682 every one 1538 of you 5216 in 1909 the name 3686 of Jesus 2424 Christ 5547 for 1519 the remission 859 of sins 266, and 2532 ye shall receive 2983 5695 the gift 1431 of the Holy 40 Ghost 4151. 

2:39 For 1063 the promise 1860 is 2076 5748 unto you 5213, and 2532 to your 5216 children 5043, and 2532 to all 3956 that are afar off 1519 3112, [even] as many as 3745 the Lord 2962 our 2257 God 2316 shall call 302 4341 5667. 

2:40 And 5037 with many 4119 other 2087 words 3056 did he testify 1263 5711 and 2532 exhort 3870 5707, saying 3004 5723, Save yourselves 4982 5682 from 575 this 5026 untoward 4646 generation 1074. 

2:41 Then 3303 3767 they that gladly 780 received 588 5666 his 846 word 3056 were baptized 907 5681: and 2532 the same 1565 day 2250 there were added 4369 5681 [unto them] about 5616 three thousand 5153 souls 5590. 

2:42 And 1161 they continued 2258 5713 stedfastly 4342 5723 in the apostles 652' doctrine 1322 and 2532 fellowship 2842, and 2532 in breaking 2800 of bread 740, and 2532 in prayers 4335. 

2:43 And 1161 fear 5401 came upon 1096 5633 every 3956 soul 5590: and 5037 many 4183 wonders 5059 and 2532 signs 4592 were done 1096 5711 by 1223 the apostles 652. 

2:44 And 1161 all 3956 that believed 4100 5723 were 2258 5713 together 1909 846, and 2532 had 2192 5707 all things 537 common 2839; 

2:45 And 2532 sold 4097 5707 their possessions 2933 and 2532 goods 5223, and 2532 parted 1266 5707 them 846 to all 3956 [men], as 2530 every man 5100 had 302 2192 5707 need 5532. 

2:46 And 5037 they, continuing 4342 5723 daily 2596 2250 with one accord 3661 in 1722 the temple 2411, and 5037 breaking 2806 5723 bread 740 from 2596 house to house 3624, did eat 3335 5707 their meat 5160 with 1722 gladness 20 and 2532 singleness 858 of heart 2588, 

2:47 Praising 134 5723 God 2316, and 2532 having 2192 5723 favour 5485 with 4314 all 3650 the people 2992. And 1161 the Lord 2962 added 4369 5707 to the church 1577 daily 2596 2250 such as should be saved 4982 5746. 

3:1 Now 1161 Peter 4074 and 2532 John 2491 went up 305 5707 together 1909 846 into 1519 the temple 2411 at the hour 5610 of prayer 4335, [being] the ninth 1766 [hour]. 

3:2 And 2532 a certain 5100 man 435 lame 5225 5723 5560 from 1537 his 848 mother's 3384 womb 2836 was carried 941 5712, whom 3739 they laid 5087 5707 daily 2250 2596 at 4314 the gate 2374 of the temple 2411 which 3588 is called 3004 5746 Beautiful 5611, to ask 154 5721 alms 1654 of 3844 them that entered 1531 5740 into 1519 the temple 2411; 

3:3 Who 3739 seeing 1492 5631 Peter 4074 and 2532 John 2491 about 3195 5723 to go 1524 5750 into 1519 the temple 2411 asked 2065 5707 5625 2983 5629 an alms 1654. 

3:4 And 1161 Peter 4074, fastening his eyes 816 5660 upon 1519 him 846 with 4862 John 2491, said 2036 5627, Look 991 5657 on us 2248. 

3:5 And 1161 he gave heed 1907 5707 unto them 846, expecting 4328 5723 to receive 2983 5629 something 5100 of 3844 them 846. 

3:6 Then 1161 Peter 4074 said 2036 5627, Silver 694 and 2532 gold 5553 have 5225 5719 I 3427 none 3756; but 1161 such as 5124 I have 2192 5719 give I 1325 5719 thee 4671: In 1722 the name 3686 of Jesus 2424 Christ 5547 of Nazareth 3480 rise up 1453 5669 and 2532 walk 4043 5720. 

3:7 And 2532 he took 4084 5660 him 846 by the right 1188 hand 5495, and lifted [him] up 1453 5656: and 1161 immediately 3916 his 846 feet 939 and 2532 ankle bones 4974 received strength 4732 5681. 

3:8 And 2532 he leaping up 1814 5740 stood 2476 5627, and 2532 walked 4043 5707, and 2532 entered 1525 5627 with 4862 them 846 into 1519 the temple 2411, walking 4043 5723, and 2532 leaping 242 5740, and 2532 praising 134 5723 God 2316. 

3:9 And 2532 all 3956 the people 2992 saw 1492 5627 him 846 walking 4043 5723 and 2532 praising 134 5723 God 2316: 

3:10 And 5037 they knew 1921 5707 that 3754 it was 2258 5713 he 3778 which 3588 sat 2521 5740 for 4314 alms 1654 at 1909 the Beautiful 5611 gate 4439 of the temple 2411: and 2532 they were filled 4130 5681 with wonder 2285 and 2532 amazement 1611 at 1909 that which had happened 4819 5761 unto him 846. 

3:11 And 1161 as the lame man 5560 which was healed 2390 5685 held 2902 5723 Peter 4074 and 2532 John 2491, all 3956 the people 2992 ran together 4936 5627 unto 4314 them 846 in 1909 the porch 4745 that is called 2564 5746 Solomon's 4672, greatly wondering 1569. 

3:12 And 1161 when Peter 4074 saw 1492 5631 [it], he answered 611 5662 unto 4314 the people 2992, Ye men 435 of Israel 2475, why 5101 marvel ye 2296 5719 at 1909 this 5129? or 2228 why 5101 look ye so earnestly 816 5719 on us 2254, as though 5613 by our own 2398 power 1411 or 2228 holiness 2150 we had made 4160 5761 this man 846 to walk 4043 5721? 

3:13 The God 2316 of Abraham 11, and 2532 of Isaac 2464, and 2532 of Jacob 2384, the God 2316 of our 2257 fathers 3962, hath glorified 1392 5656 his 848 Son 3816 Jesus 2424; whom 3739 ye 5210 delivered up 3860 5656, and 2532 denied 720 5662 him 846 in 2596 the presence 4383 of Pilate 4091, when he was determined 2919 5660 to let 630 0 [him] 1565 go 630 5721. 

3:14 But 1161 ye 5210 denied 720 5662 the Holy One 40 and 2532 the Just 1342, and 2532 desired 154 5668 a murderer 5406 435 to be granted 5483 5683 unto you 5213; 

3:15 And 1161 killed 615 5656 the Prince 747 of life 2222, whom 3739 God 2316 hath raised 1453 5656 from 1537 the dead 3498; whereof 3739 we 2249 are 2070 5748 witnesses 3144. 

3:16 And 2532 his 846 name 3686 through 1909 faith 4102 in his name 3686 hath made 4732 0 this man 5026 strong 4732 5656, whom 3739 ye see 2334 5719 and 2532 know 1492 5758: yea 2532, the faith 4102 which is 1325 0 by 1223 him 846 hath given 1325 5656 him 846 this 5126 perfect soundness 3647 in the presence 561 of you 5216 all 3956. 

3:17 And 2532 now 3568, brethren 80, I wot 1492 5758 that 3754 through 2596 ignorance 52 ye did 4238 5656 [it], as 5618 [did] also 2532 your 5216 rulers 758. 

3:18 But 1161 those things, which 3739 God 2316 before had shewed 4293 5656 by 1223 the mouth 4750 of all 3956 his 848 prophets 4396, that Christ 5547 should suffer 3958 5629, he hath 4137 0 so 3779 fulfilled 4137 5656. 

3:19 Repent ye 3340 5657 therefore 3767, and 2532 be converted 1994 5657, that 1519 your 5216 sins 266 may be blotted out 1813 5683, when 3704 the times 2540 of refreshing 403 shall come 302 2064 5632 from 575 the presence 4383 of the Lord 2962; 

3:20 And 2532 he shall send 649 5661 Jesus 2424 Christ 5547, which before was preached 4296 5772 unto you 5213: 

3:21 Whom 3739 the heaven 3772 3303 must 1163 5748 receive 1209 5664 until 891 the times 5550 of restitution 605 of all things 3956, which 3739 God 2316 hath spoken 2980 5656 by 1223 the mouth 4750 of all 3956 his 848 holy 40 prophets 4396 since 575 the world began 165. 

3:22 For 1063 Moses 3475 truly 3303 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 the fathers 3962, 3754 A prophet 4396 shall 450 0 the Lord 2962 your 5216 God 2316 raise up 450 5692 unto you 5213 of 1537 your 5216 brethren 80, like 5613 unto me 1691; him 846 shall ye hear 191 5695 in 2596 all things 3956 whatsoever 3745 302 he shall say 2980 5661 unto 4314 you 5209. 

3:23 And 1161 it shall come to pass 2071 5704, [that] every 3956 soul 5590, which 3748 302 will 191 0 not 3361 hear 191 5661 that 1565 prophet 4396, shall be destroyed 1842 5701 from among 1537 the people 2992. 

3:24 Yea 2532, and 1161 all 3956 the prophets 4396 from 575 Samuel 4545 and 2532 those that follow after 2517, as many as 3745 have spoken 2980 5656, have 4293 0 likewise 2532 foretold 4293 5656 of these 5025 days 2250. 

3:25 Ye 5210 are 2075 5748 the children 5207 of the prophets 4396, and 2532 of the covenant 1242 which 3739 God 2316 made 1303 5639 with 4314 our 2257 fathers 3962, saying 3004 5723 unto 4314 Abraham 11, And 2532 in thy 4675 seed 4690 shall 1757 0 all 3956 the kindreds 3965 of the earth 1093 be blessed 1757 5701. 

3:26 Unto you 5213 first 4412 God 2316, having raised up 450 5660 his 848 Son 3816 Jesus 2424, sent 649 5656 him 846 to bless 2127 5723 you 5209, in 1722 turning away 654 5721 every one 1538 of you 5216 from 575 his iniquities 4189. 

4:1 And 1161 as they spake 2980 5723 unto 4314 the people 2992, the priests 2409, and 2532 the captain 4755 of the temple 2411, and 2532 the Sadducees 4523, came upon 2186 5627 them 846, 

4:2 Being grieved 1278 5740 that 1223 they 846 taught 1321 5721 the people 2992, and 2532 preached 2605 5721 through 1722 Jesus 2424 the resurrection 386 from 1537 the dead 3498. 

4:3 And 2532 they laid 1911 5627 hands 5495 on them 846, and 2532 put 5087 5639 [them] in 1519 hold 5084 unto 1519 the next day 839: for 1063 it was 2258 5713 now 2235 eventide 2073. 

4:4 Howbeit 1161 many 4183 of them which heard 191 5660 the word 3056 believed 4100 5656; and 2532 the number 706 of the men 435 was 1096 5675 about 5616 five 4002 thousand 5505. 

4:5 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633 on 1909 the morrow 839, that their rulers 758, and 2532 elders 4245, and 2532 scribes 1122, 

4:6 And 2532 Annas 452 the high priest 749, and 2532 Caiaphas 2533, and 2532 John 2491, and 2532 Alexander 223, and 2532 as many as 3745 were 2258 5713 of 1537 the kindred 1085 of the high priest 748, were gathered together 4863 5683 at 1519 Jerusalem 2419. 

4:7 And 2532 when they had set 2476 5660 them 846 in 1722 the midst 3319, they asked 4441 5711, By 1722 what 4169 power 1411, or 2228 by 1722 what 4169 name 3686, have 4160 0 ye 5210 done 4160 5656 this 5124? 

4:8 Then 5119 Peter 4074, filled 4130 5685 with the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Ye rulers 758 of the people 2992, and 2532 elders 4245 of Israel 2474, 

4:9 If 1487 we 2249 this day 4594 be examined 350 5743 of 1909 the good deed done 2108 to the impotent 772 man 444, by 1722 what means 5101 he 3778 is made whole 4982 5769; 

4:10 Be it 2077 5749 known 1110 unto you 5213 all 3956, and 2532 to all 3956 the people 2992 of Israel 2474, that 3754 by 1722 the name 3686 of Jesus 2424 Christ 5547 of Nazareth 3480, whom 3739 ye 5210 crucified 4717 5656, whom 3739 God 2316 raised 1453 5656 from 1537 the dead 3498, [even] by 1722 him 5129 doth 3936 0 this man 3778 stand here 3936 5758 before 1799 you 5216 whole 5199. 

4:11 This 3778 is 2076 5748 the stone 3037 which 3588 was set at nought 1848 5685 of 5259 you 5216 builders 3618 5723, which 3588 is become 1096 5637 the head 2776 of 1519 the corner 1137. 

4:12 Neither 2532 3756 is there 2076 5748 salvation 4991 in 1722 any 3762 other 243: for 1063 there is 2076 5748 none 3777 other 2087 name 3686 under 5259 heaven 3772 given 1325 5772 among 1722 men 444, whereby 1722 3739 we 2248 must 1163 5748 be saved 4982 5683. 

4:13 Now 1161 when they saw 2334 5723 the boldness 3954 of Peter 4074 and 2532 John 2491, and 2532 perceived 2638 5642 that 3754 they were 1526 5748 unlearned 62 and 2532 ignorant 2399 men 444, they marvelled 2296 5707; and 5037 they took knowledge 1921 5707 of them 846, that 3754 they had been 2258 5713 with 4862 Jesus 2424. 

4:14 And 1161 beholding 991 5723 the man 444 which was healed 2323 5772 standing 2476 5761 with 4862 them 846, they could 2192 5707 say 471 0 nothing 3762 against it 471 5629. 

4:15 But 1161 when they had commanded 2753 5660 them 846 to go aside 565 5629 out of 1854 the council 4892, they conferred 4820 5627 among 4314 themselves 240, 

4:16 Saying 3004 5723, What 5101 shall we do 4160 5692 to these 5125 men 444? for 1063 that 3754 indeed 3303 a notable 1110 miracle 4592 hath been done 1096 5754 by 1223 them 846 [is] manifest 5318 to all them 3956 that dwell 2730 5723 in Jerusalem 2419; and 2532 we cannot 3756 1410 5736 deny 720 5664 [it]. 

4:17 But 235 that 3363 0 it spread 1268 5686 no 3363 further 1909 4119 among 1519 the people 2992, let us straitly 547 threaten 546 5672 them 846, that they speak 2980 5721 henceforth 3371 to no 3367 man 444 in 1909 this 5129 name 3686. 

4:18 And 2532 they called 2564 5660 them 846, and commanded 3853 5656 them 846 not 3361 to speak 5350 5738 at all 2527 nor 3366 teach 1321 5721 in 1909 the name 3686 of Jesus 2424. 

4:19 But 1161 Peter 4074 and 2532 John 2491 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Whether 1487 it be 2076 5748 right 1342 in the sight 1799 of God 2316 to hearken 191 5721 unto you 5216 more than 3123 2228 unto God 2316, judge ye 2919 5657. 

4:20 For 1063 we 2249 cannot 3756 1410 5736 but 3361 speak 2980 5721 the things which 3739 we have seen 1492 5627 and 2532 heard 191 5656. 

4:21 So 1161 when they had further threatened 4324 5671 them 846, they let 630 0 them 846 go 630 5656, finding 2147 5723 nothing 3367 how 4459 they might punish 2849 5672 them 846, because 1223 of the people 2992: for 3754 all 3956 [men] glorified 1392 5707 God 2316 for 1909 that which was done 1096 5756. 

4:22 For 1063 the man 444 was 2258 5713 above 4119 forty 5062 years old 2094, on 1909 whom 3739 this 5124 miracle 4592 of healing 2392 was shewed 1096 5715. 

4:23 And 1161 being let go 630 5685, they went 2064 5627 to 4314 their own company 2398, and 2532 reported 518 5656 all 3745 that the chief priests 749 and 2532 elders 4245 had said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846. 

4:24 And 1161 when they heard that 191 5660, they lifted up 142 5656 their voice 5456 to 4314 God 2316 with one accord 3661, and 2532 said 2036 5627, Lord 1203, thou 4771 [art] God 2316, which 3588 hast made 4160 5660 heaven 3772, and 2532 earth 1093, and 2532 the sea 2281, and 2532 all 3956 that in 1722 them is 846: 

4:25 Who 3588 by 1223 the mouth 4750 of thy 4675 servant 3816 David 1138 hast said 2036 5631, Why 2444 did 5433 0 the heathen 1484 rage 5433 5656, and 2532 the people 2992 imagine 3191 5656 vain things 2756? 

4:26 The kings 935 of the earth 1093 stood up 3936 5656, and 2532 the rulers 758 were gathered 4863 5681 together 1909 846 against 2596 the Lord 2962, and 2532 against 2596 his 846 Christ 5547. 

4:27 For 1063 of 1909 a truth 225 against 1909 thy 4675 holy 40 child 3816 Jesus 2424, whom 3739 thou hast anointed 5548 5656, both 5037 Herod 2264, and 2532 Pontius 4194 Pilate 4091, with 4862 the Gentiles 1484, and 2532 the people 2992 of Israel 2474, were gathered together 4863 5681, 

4:28 For to do 4160 5658 whatsoever 3745 thy 4675 hand 5495 and 2532 thy 4675 counsel 1012 determined before 4309 5656 to be done 1096 5635. 

4:29 And 2532 now 3569, Lord 2962, behold 1896 5628 1909 their 846 threatenings 547: and 2532 grant unto 1325 5628 thy 4675 servants 1401, that with 3326 all 3956 boldness 3954 they may speak 2980 5721 thy 4675 word 3056, 

4:30 By 1722 4571 stretching forth 1614 5721 thine 4675 hand 5495 to 1519 heal 2392; and 2532 that signs 4592 and 2532 wonders 5059 may be done 1096 5738 by 1223 the name 3686 of thy 4675 holy 40 child 3816 Jesus 2424. 

4:31 And 2532 when they 846 had prayed 1189 5679, the place 5117 was shaken 4531 5681 where 1722 3739 they were 2258 5713 assembled together 4863 5772; and 2532 they were 4130 0 all 537 filled 4130 5681 with the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, and 2532 they spake 2980 5707 the word 3056 of God 2316 with 3326 boldness 3954. 

4:32 And 1161 the multitude 4128 of them that believed 4100 5660 were 2258 5713 of one heart 2588 and 2532 of one 3391 soul 5590: neither 2532 3761 said 3004 5707 any 1520 [of them] that ought 5100 of the things which he possessed 5224 5723 was 1511 5750 his own 2398; but 235 they had 2258 5713 all things 537 common 2839. 

4:33 And 2532 with great 3173 power 1411 gave 591 5707 the apostles 652 witness 3142 of the resurrection 386 of the Lord 2962 Jesus 2424: and 5037 great 3173 grace 5485 was 2258 5713 upon 1909 them 846 all 3956. 

4:34 Neither 3761 1063 was 5225 5707 there any 5100 among 1722 them 846 that lacked 1729: for 1063 as many as 3745 were 5225 5707 possessors 2935 of lands 5564 or 2228 houses 3614 sold them 4453 5723, and brought 5342 5707 the prices 5092 of the things that were sold 4097 5746, 

4:35 And 2532 laid [them] down 5087 5707 at 3844 the apostles 652' feet 4228: and 1161 distribution was made 1239 5712 unto every man 1538 according 2530 as 302 he had 2192 5707 need 5100 5532. 

4:36 And 1161 Joses 2500, who 3588 by 5259 the apostles 652 was surnamed 1941 5685 Barnabas 921, (which 3739 is 2076 5748, being interpreted 3177 5746, The son 5207 of consolation 3874) a Levite 3019, [and] of the country 1085 of Cyprus 2953, 

4:37 Having 5225 5723 846 land 68, sold 4453 5660 [it], and brought 5342 5656 the money 5536, and 2532 laid 5087 5656 [it] at 3844 the apostles 652' feet 4228. 

5:1 But 1161 a certain 5100 man 435 named 3686 Ananias 367, with 4862 Sapphira 4551 his 848 wife 1135, sold 4453 5656 a possession 2933, 

5:2 And 2532 kept back 3557 5668 [part] of 575 the price 5092, his 846 wife 1135 also 2532 being privy 4894 5761 [to it], and 2532 brought 5342 5660 a certain 5100 part 3313, and laid 5087 5656 [it] at 3844 the apostles 652' feet 4228. 

5:3 But 1161 Peter 4074 said 2036 5627, Ananias 367, why 1302 hath Satan 4567 filled 4137 5656 thine 4675 heart 2588 4571 to lie 5574 5664 to the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, and 2532 to keep back 3557 5670 [part] of 575 the price 5092 of the land 5564? 

5:4 Whiles it remained 3306 5723, was it not 3780 thine own 4671 3306 5707? and 2532 after it was sold 4097 5685, was it not 5225 5707 in 1722 thine own 4674 power 1849? why 5101 3754 hast thou conceived 5087 5639 this 5124 thing 4229 in 1722 thine 4675 heart 2588? thou hast 5574 0 not 3756 lied 5574 5662 unto men 444, but 235 unto God 2316. 

5:5 And 1161 Ananias 367 hearing 191 5723 these 5128 words 3056 fell down 4098 5631, and gave up the ghost 1634 5656: and 2532 great 3173 fear 5401 came 1096 5633 on 1909 all 3956 them that heard 191 5723 these things 5023. 

5:6 And 1161 the young men 3501 arose 450 5631, wound 4958 0 him 846 up 4958 5656, and 2532 carried [him] out 1627 5660, and buried 2290 5656 [him]. 

5:7 And 1161 it was 1096 5633 about 5613 the space 1292 0 of three 5140 hours 5610 after 1292, when 2532 his 846 wife 1135, not 3361 knowing 1492 5761 what was done 1096 5756, came in 1525 5627. 

5:8 And 1161 Peter 4074 answered 611 5662 unto her 846, Tell 2036 5628 me 3427 whether 1487 ye sold 591 5639 the land 5564 for so much 5118? And 1161 she said 2036 5627, Yea 3483, for so much 5118. 

5:9 Then 1161 Peter 4074 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 her 846, How 5101 is it that 3754 ye 5213 have agreed together 4856 5681 to tempt 3985 5658 the Spirit 4151 of the Lord 2962? behold 2400 5628, the feet 4228 of them which have buried 2290 5660 thy 4675 husband 435 [are] at 1909 the door 2374, and 2532 shall carry 1627 0 thee 4571 out 1627 5692. 

5:10 Then 1161 fell she down 4098 5627 straightway 3916 at 3844 his 846 feet 4228, and 2532 yielded up the ghost 1634 5656: and 1161 the young men 3495 came in 1525 5631, and found 2147 5627 her 846 dead 3498, and 2532, carrying [her] forth 1627 5660, buried 2290 5656 [her] by 4314 her 846 husband 435. 

5:11 And 2532 great 3173 fear 5401 came 1096 5633 upon 1909 all 3650 the church 1577, and 2532 upon 1909 as many as 3956 heard 191 5723 these things 5023. 

5:12 And 1161 by 1223 the hands 5495 of the apostles 652 were 1096 0 many 4183 signs 4592 and 2532 wonders 5059 wrought 1096 5633 5625 1096 5711 among 1722 the people 2992; (and 2532 they were 2258 5713 all 537 with one accord 3661 in 1722 Solomon's 4672 porch 4745. 

5:13 And 1161 of the rest 3062 durst 5111 5707 no man 3762 join himself 2853 5745 to them 846: but 235 the people 2992 magnified 3170 5707 them 846. 

5:14 And 1161 believers 4100 5723 were 4369 0 the more 3123 added 4369 5712 to the Lord 2962, multitudes 4128 both 5037 of men 435 and 2532 women 1135) 

5:15 Insomuch 5620 that they brought forth 1627 5721 the sick 772 into 2596 the streets 4113, and 2532 laid 5087 5721 [them] on 1909 beds 2825 and 2532 couches 2895, that 2443 at the least 2579 the shadow 4639 of Peter 4074 passing by 2064 5740 might overshadow 1982 5661 some 5100 of them 846. 

5:16 1161 There came 4905 5711 also 2532 a multitude 4128 [out] of the cities 4172 round about 4038 unto 1519 Jerusalem 2419, bringing 5342 5723 sick 772 folks, and 2532 them which were vexed 3791 5746 with 5259 unclean 169 spirits 4151: and they 3748 were healed 2323 5712 every one 537. 

5:17 Then 1161 the high priest 749 rose up 450 5631, and 2532 all they 3956 that were with 4862 him 846, (which 3588 is 5607 5752 the sect 139 of the Sadducees 4523) and were filled 4130 5681 with indignation 2205, 

5:18 And 2532 laid 1911 5627 their 848 hands 5495 on 1909 the apostles 652, and 2532 put 5087 5639 them 846 in 1722 the common 1219 prison 5084. 

5:19 But 1161 the angel 32 of the Lord 2962 by 1223 night 3571 opened 455 5656 the prison 5438 doors 2374, and 5037 brought 1806 0 them 846 forth 1806 5631, and said 2036 5627, 

5:20 Go 4198 5737, stand 2476 5685 and 2532 speak 2980 5720 in 1722 the temple 2411 to the people 2992 all 3956 the words 4487 of this 5026 life 2222. 

5:21 And 1161 when they heard 191 5660 [that], they entered 1525 5627 into 1519 the temple 2411 early in the morning 5259 3722, and 2532 taught 1321 5707. But 1161 the high priest 749 came 3854 5637, and 2532 they that were with 4862 him 846, and called 4779 0 the council 4892 together 4779 5656, and 2532 all 3956 the senate 1087 of the children 5207 of Israel 2474, and 2532 sent 649 5656 to 1519 the prison 1201 to have 71 0 them 846 brought 71 5683. 

5:22 But 1161 when the officers 5257 came 3854 5637, and found 2147 5627 them 846 not 3756 in 1722 the prison 5438, they returned 390 5660, and 1161 told 518 5656, 

5:23 Saying 3004 5723, 3754 The prison 1201 truly 3303 found we 2147 5627 shut 2808 5772 with 1722 all 3956 safety 803, and 2532 the keepers 5441 standing 2476 5761 without 1854 before 4253 the doors 2374: but 1161 when we had opened 455 5660, we found 2147 5627 no man 3762 within 2080. 

5:24 Now 1161 when 5613 5037 the high priest 2409 and 2532 the captain 4755 of the temple 2411 and 2532 the chief priests 749 heard 191 5656 these 5128 things 3056, they doubted 1280 5707 of 4012 them 846 whereunto 5101 302 this 5124 would grow 1096 5636. 

5:25 Then came 3854 5637 one 5100 and 1161 told 518 5656 them 846, saying 3004 5723, 3754 Behold 2400 5628, the men 435 whom 3739 ye put 5087 5639 in 1722 prison 5438 are 1526 5748 standing 2476 5761 in 1722 the temple 2411, and 2532 teaching 1321 5723 the people 2992. 

5:26 Then 5119 went 565 5631 the captain 4755 with 4862 the officers 5257, and brought 71 5627 them 846 without 3756 3326 violence 970: for 1063 they feared 5399 5711 the people 2992, lest 3363 they should have been stoned 3034 5686. 

5:27 And 1161 when they had brought 71 5631 them 846, they set 2476 5627 [them] before 1722 the council 4892: and 2532 the high priest 749 asked 1905 5656 them 846, 

5:28 Saying 3004 5723, Did 3853 0 not 3756 we straitly 3852 command 3853 5656 you 5213 that ye should 1321 0 not 3361 teach 1321 5721 in 1909 this 5129 name 3686? and 2532, behold 2400 5628, ye have filled 4137 5758 Jerusalem 2419 with your 5216 doctrine 1322, and 2532 intend 1014 5736 to bring 1863 5629 this 5127 man's 444 blood 129 upon 1909 us 2248. 

5:29 Then 1161 Peter 4074 and 2532 the [other] apostles 652 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, We ought 1163 5748 to obey 3980 5721 God 2316 rather 3123 than 2228 men 444. 

5:30 The God 2316 of our 2257 fathers 3962 raised up 1453 5656 Jesus 2424, whom 3739 ye 5210 slew 1315 5668 and hanged 2910 5660 on 1909 a tree 3586. 

5:31 Him 5126 hath God 2316 exalted 5312 5656 with his 848 right hand 1188 [to be] a Prince 747 and 2532 a Saviour 4990, for to give 1325 5629 repentance 3341 to Israel 2474, and 2532 forgiveness 859 of sins 266. 

5:32 And 2532 we 2249 are 2070 5748 his 846 witnesses 3144 of these 5130 things 4487; and 2532 [so is] also 1161 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, whom 3739 God 2316 hath given 1325 5656 to them that obey 3980 5723 him 846. 

5:33 When 1161 they heard 191 5660 [that], they were cut 1282 5712 [to the heart], and 2532 took counsel 1011 5711 to slay 337 5629 them 846. 

5:34 Then 1161 stood there up 450 5631 one 5100 in 1722 the council 4892, a Pharisee 5330, named 3686 Gamaliel 1059, a doctor of the law 3547, had in reputation 5093 among all 3956 the people 2992, and commanded 2753 5656 to put 4160 5658 the apostles 652 forth 1854 a 5100 little space 1024; 

5:35 And 5037 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Ye men 435 of Israel 2475, take heed 4337 5720 to yourselves 1438 what 5101 ye intend 3195 5719 to do 4238 5721 as touching 1909 these 5125 men 444. 

5:36 For 1063 before 4253 these 5130 days 2250 rose up 450 5627 Theudas 2333, boasting 3004 5723 himself 1438 to be 1511 5750 somebody 5100; to whom 3739 a number 706 of men 435, about 5616 four hundred 5071, joined themselves 4347 5681: who 3739 was slain 337 5681; and 2532 all 3956, as many as 3745 obeyed 3982 5712 him 846, were scattered 1262 5681, and 2532 brought 1096 5633 to 1519 nought 3762. 

5:37 After 3326 this man 5126 rose up 450 5627 Judas 2455 of Galilee 1057 in 1722 the days 2250 of the taxing 582, and 2532 drew away 868 5656 much 2425 people 2992 after 3694 him 848: he also 2548 perished 622 5639; and 2532 all 3956, [even] as many as 3745 obeyed 3982 5712 him 846, were dispersed 1287 5681. 

5:38 And 2532 now 3569 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Refrain 868 5628 from 575 these 5130 men 444, and 2532 let 1439 0 them 846 alone 1439 5657: for 3754 if 1437 this 3778 counsel 1012 or 2228 this 5124 work 2041 be 5600 5753 of 1537 men 444, it will come to nought 2647 5701: 

5:39 But 1161 if 1487 it be 2076 5748 of 1537 God 2316, ye cannot 3756 1410 5736 overthrow 2647 5658 it 846; lest haply 3379 ye be found 2147 5686 even 2532 to fight against God 2314. 

5:40 And 1161 to him 846 they agreed 3982 5681: and 2532 when they had called 4341 5666 the apostles 652, and beaten 1194 5660 [them], they commanded 3853 5656 that they should 2980 0 not 3361 speak 2980 5721 in 1909 the name 3686 of Jesus 2424, and 2532 let 630 0 them 846 go 630 5656. 

5:41 And 3767 they departed 4198 5711 3303 from 575 the presence 4383 of the council 4892, rejoicing 5463 5723 that 3754 they were counted worthy 2661 5681 to suffer shame 818 5683 for 5228 his 846 name 3686. 

5:42 And 5037 daily 2250 3956 in 1722 the temple 2411, and 2532 in every 2596 house 3624, they ceased 3973 5710 not 3756 to teach 1321 5723 and 2532 preach 2097 5734 Jesus 2424 Christ 5547. 

6:1 And 1161 in 1722 those 5025 days 2250, when the number 4129 0 of the disciples 3101 was multiplied 4129 5723, there arose 1096 5633 a murmuring 1112 of the Grecians 1675 against 4314 the Hebrews 1445, because 3754 their 846 widows 5503 were neglected 3865 5712 in 1722 the daily 2522 ministration 1248. 

6:2 Then 1161 the twelve 1427 called 4341 5666 the multitude 4128 of the disciples 3101 [unto them], and said 2036 5627, It is 2076 5748 not 3756 reason 701 that we 2248 should leave 2641 5660 the word 3056 of God 2316, and serve 1247 5721 tables 5132. 

6:3 Wherefore 3767, brethren 80, look ye out 1980 5663 among 1537 you 5216 seven 2033 men 435 of honest report 3140 5746, full 4134 of the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 and 2532 wisdom 4678, whom 3739 we may appoint 2525 5692 over 1909 this 5026 business 5532. 

6:4 But 1161 we 2249 will give ourselves continually 4342 5692 to prayer 4335, and 2532 to the ministry 1248 of the word 3056. 

6:5 And 2532 the saying 3056 pleased 700 5656 1799 the whole 3956 multitude 4128: and 2532 they chose 1586 5668 Stephen 4736, a man 435 full 4134 of faith 4102 and 2532 of the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, and 2532 Philip 5376, and 2532 Prochorus 4402, and 2532 Nicanor 3527, and 2532 Timon 5096, and 2532 Parmenas 3937, and 2532 Nicolas 3532 a proselyte 4339 of Antioch 491: 

6:6 Whom 3739 they set 2476 5627 before 1799 the apostles 652: and 2532 when they had prayed 4336 5666, they laid 2007 0 [their] hands 5495 on 2007 5656 them 846. 

6:7 And 2532 the word 3056 of God 2316 increased 837 5707; and 2532 the number 706 of the disciples 3101 multiplied 4129 5712 in 1722 Jerusalem 2419 greatly 4970; and 5037 a great 4183 company 3793 of the priests 2409 were obedient 5219 5707 to the faith 4102. 

6:8 And 1161 Stephen 4736, full 4134 of faith 4102 and 2532 power 1411, did 4160 5707 great 3173 wonders 5059 and 2532 miracles 4592 among 1722 the people 2992. 

6:9 Then 1161 there arose 450 5656 certain 5100 of 1537 the synagogue 4864, which 3588 is called 3004 5746 [the synagogue] of the Libertines 3032, and 2532 Cyrenians 2956, and 2532 Alexandrians 221, and 2532 of them of 575 Cilicia 2791 and 2532 of Asia 773, disputing 4802 5723 with Stephen 4736. 

6:10 And 2532 they were 2480 0 not 3756 able 2480 5707 to resist 436 5629 the wisdom 4678 and 2532 the spirit 4151 by which 3739 he spake 2980 5707. 

6:11 Then 5119 they suborned 5260 5627 men 435, which said 3004 5723, 3754 We have heard 191 5754 him 846 speak 2980 5723 blasphemous 989 words 4487 against 1519 Moses 3475, and 2532 [against] God 2316. 

6:12 And 5037 they stirred up 4787 5656 the people 2992, and 2532 the elders 4245, and 2532 the scribes 1122, and 2532 came upon 2186 5631 [him], and caught 4884 5656 him 846, and 2532 brought 71 5627 [him] to 1519 the council 4892, 

6:13 And 5037 set up 2476 5627 false 5571 witnesses 3144, which said 3004 5723, This 5127 man 444 ceaseth 3973 5731 not 3756 to speak 2980 5723 blasphemous 989 words 4487 against 2596 this 3778 holy 40 place 5117, and 2532 the law 3551: 

6:14 For 1063 we have heard 191 5754 him 846 say 3004 5723, that 3754 this 5126 Jesus 2424 of Nazareth 3480 shall destroy 2647 5692 this 3778 place 5117, and 2532 shall change 236 5692 the customs 1485 which 3739 Moses 3475 delivered 3860 5656 us 2254. 

6:15 And 2532 all 537 that sat 2516 5740 in 1722 the council 4892, looking stedfastly 816 5660 on 1519 him 846, saw 1492 5627 his 846 face 4383 as it had been 5616 the face 4383 of an angel 32. 

7:1 Then 1161 said 2036 5627 the high priest 749, Are 1487 686 2192 5719 these things 5023 so 3779? 

7:2 And 1161 he said 5346 5713, Men 435, brethren 80, and 2532 fathers 3962, hearken 191 5657; The God 2316 of glory 1391 appeared 3700 5681 unto our 2257 father 3962 Abraham 11, when he was 5607 5752 in 1722 Mesopotamia 3318, before 4250 2228 he dwelt 2730 5658 in 1722 Charran 5488, 

7:3 And 2532 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Get thee 1831 5628 out of 1537 thy 4675 country 1093, and 2532 from 1537 thy 4675 kindred 4772, and 2532 come 1204 5773 into 1519 the land 1093 which 3739 302 I shall shew 1166 5692 thee 4671. 

7:4 Then 5119 came he 1831 5631 out of 1537 the land 1093 of the Chaldaeans 5466, and dwelt 2730 5656 in 1722 Charran 5488: and from thence 2547, when 3326 his 846 father 3962 was dead 599 5629, he removed 3351 5656 him 846 into 1519 this 5026 land 1093, wherein 1519 3739 ye 5210 now 3568 dwell 2730 5719. 

7:5 And 2532 he gave 1325 5656 him 846 none 3756 inheritance 2817 in 1722 it 846, no, not 3761 [so much as] to set 968 0 his foot 4228 on 968: yet 2532 he promised 1861 5662 that he would give 1325 5629 it 846 to him 846 for 1519 a possession 2697, and 2532 to his 846 seed 4690 after 3326 him 846, when [as yet] he 846 had 5607 5752 no 3756 child 5043. 

7:6 And 1161 God 2316 spake 2980 5656 on this wise 3779, That 3754 his 846 seed 4690 should 2071 5704 sojourn 3941 in 1722 a strange 245 land 1093; and 2532 that they should bring 1402 0 them 846 into bondage 1402 5692, and 2532 entreat [them] evil 2559 5692 four hundred 5071 years 2094. 

7:7 And 2532 the nation 1484 to whom 3739 1437 they shall be in bondage 1398 5661 will 2919 0 I 1473 judge 2919 5692, said 2036 5627 God 2316: and 2532 after 3326 that 5023 shall they come forth 1831 5695, and 2532 serve 3000 5692 me 3427 in 1722 this 5129 place 5117. 

7:8 And 2532 he gave 1325 5656 him 846 the covenant 1242 of circumcision 4061: and 2532 so 3779 [Abraham] begat 1080 5656 Isaac 2464, and 2532 circumcised 4059 5627 him 846 the eighth 3590 day 2250; and 2532 Isaac 2464 [begat] Jacob 2384; and 2532 Jacob 2384 [begat] the twelve 1427 patriarchs 3966. 

7:9 And 2532 the patriarchs 3966, moved with envy 2206 5660, sold 591 5639 Joseph 2501 into 1519 Egypt 125: but 2532 God 2316 was 2258 5713 with 3326 him 846, 

7:10 And 2532 delivered 1807 5639 him 846 out of 1537 all 3956 his 846 afflictions 2347, and 2532 gave 1325 5656 him 846 favour 5485 and 2532 wisdom 4678 in the sight 1726 of Pharaoh 5328 king 935 of Egypt 125; and 2532 he made 2525 5656 him 846 governor 2233 5740 over 1909 Egypt 125 and 2532 all 3650 his 848 house 3624. 

7:11 Now 1161 there came 2064 5627 a dearth 3042 over 1909 all 3650 the land 1093 of Egypt 125 and 2532 Chanaan 5477, and 2532 great 3173 affliction 2347: and 2532 our 2257 fathers 3962 found 2147 5707 no 3756 sustenance 5527. 

7:12 But 1161 when Jacob 2384 heard 191 5660 that there was 5607 5752 corn 4621 in 1722 Egypt 125, he sent out 1821 5656 our 2257 fathers 3962 first 4412. 

7:13 And 2532 at 1722 the second 1208 [time] Joseph 2501 was made known 319 5681 to his 848 brethren 80; and 2532 Joseph's 2501 kindred 1085 was made 1096 5633 known 5318 unto Pharaoh 5328. 

7:14 Then 1161 sent 649 5660 Joseph 2501, and called 3333 5668 his 848 father 3962 Jacob 2384 to [him], and 2532 all 3956 his 848 kindred 4772, 1722 threescore 1440 and fifteen 4002 souls 5590. 

7:15 So 1161 Jacob 2384 went down 2597 5627 into 1519 Egypt 125, and 2532 died 5053 5656, he 846, and 2532 our 2257 fathers 3962, 

7:16 And 2532 were carried over 3346 5681 into 1519 Sychem 4966, and 2532 laid 5087 5681 in 1722 the sepulchre 3418 that 3739 Abraham 11 bought 5608 5662 for a sum 5092 of money 694 of 3844 the sons 5207 of Emmor 1697 [the father 3588] of Sychem 4966. 

7:17 But 1161 when 2531 the time 5550 of the promise 1860 drew nigh 1448 5707, which 3739 God 2316 had sworn 3660 5656 to Abraham 11, the people 2992 grew 837 5656 and 2532 multiplied 4129 5681 in 1722 Egypt 125, 

7:18 Till 891 another 2087 king 935 arose 450 5627, which 3739 knew 1492 5715 not 3756 Joseph 2501. 

7:19 The same 3778 dealt subtilly 2686 5666 with our 2257 kindred 1085, and evil entreated 2559 5656 our 2257 fathers 3962, so that 4160 5721 they cast out 1570 their 848 young children 1025, to the end 1519 they might 2225 0 not 3361 live 2225 5745. 

7:20 In 1722 which 3739 time 2540 Moses 3475 was born 1080 5681, and 2532 was 2258 5713 exceeding 2316 fair 791, and 3739 nourished up 397 5648 in 1722 his 848 father's 3962 house 3624 three 5140 months 3376: 

7:21 And 1161 when he was cast out 1620 5685, Pharaoh's 5328 daughter 2364 took 337 0 him 846 up 337 5639, and 2532 nourished 397 5668 him 846 for 1519 her own 1438 son 5207. 

7:22 And 2532 Moses 3475 was learned 3811 5681 in all 3956 the wisdom 4678 of the Egyptians 124, and 1161 was 2258 5713 mighty 1415 in 1722 words 3056 and 2532 in 1722 deeds 2041. 

7:23 And 1161 when 5613 he 846 was full 4137 5712 forty years 5063 old 5550, it came 305 5627 into 1909 his 846 heart 2588 to visit 1980 5664 his 848 brethren 80 the children 5207 of Israel 2474. 

7:24 And 2532 seeing 1492 5631 one 5100 [of them] suffer wrong 91 5746, he defended 292 5662 [him], and 2532 avenged 1557 4160 5656 him that was oppressed 2669 5746, and smote 3960 5660 the Egyptian 124: 

7:25 For 1161 he supposed 3543 5707 his 848 brethren 80 would have understood 4920 5721 how 3754 that God 2316 by 1223 his 846 hand 5495 would deliver 1325 5719 4991 them 846: but 1161 they understood 4920 5656 not 3756. 

7:26 And 5037 the next 1966 5752 day 2250 he shewed himself 3700 5681 unto them 846 as they strove 3164 5736, and 2532 would have set 4900 5656 them 846 at 1519 one again 1515, saying 2036 5631, Sirs 435, ye 5210 are 2075 5748 brethren 80; why 2444 do ye wrong 91 5719 one to another 240? 

7:27 But 1161 he that did 91 0 his neighbour 4139 wrong 91 5723 thrust 683 0 him 846 away 683 5662, saying 2036 5631, Who 5101 made 2525 5656 thee 4571 a ruler 758 and 2532 a judge 1348 over 1909 us 2248? 

7:28 Wilt 3361 2309 5719 thou 4771 kill 337 5629 me 3165, as 3739 5158 thou diddest 337 5627 the Egyptian 124 yesterday 5504? 

7:29 Then 1161 fled 5343 5627 Moses 3475 at 1722 this 5129 saying 3056, and 2532 was 1096 5633 a stranger 3941 in 1722 the land 1093 of Madian 3099, where 3757 he begat 1080 5656 two 1417 sons 5207. 

7:30 And 2532 when forty 5062 years 2094 were expired 4137 5685, there appeared 3700 5681 to him 846 in 1722 the wilderness 2048 of mount 3735 Sina 4614 an angel 32 of the Lord 2962 in 1722 a flame 5395 of fire 4442 in a bush 942. 

7:31 When 1161 Moses 3475 saw 1492 5631 [it], he wondered 2296 5656 at the sight 3705: and 1161 as he drew near 4334 5740 to behold 2657 5658 [it], the voice 5456 of the Lord 2962 came 1096 5633 unto 4314 him 846, 

7:32 [Saying], I 1473 [am] the God 2316 of thy 4675 fathers 3962, the God 2316 of Abraham 11, and 2532 the God 2316 of Isaac 2464, and 2532 the God 2316 of Jacob 2384. Then 1161 Moses 3475 trembled 1096 5637 1790, and durst 5111 5707 not 3756 behold 2657 5658. 

7:33 Then 1161 said 2036 5627 the Lord 2962 to him 846, Put off 3089 5657 thy shoes 5266 from thy 4675 feet 4228: for 1063 the place 5117 where 1722 3739 thou standest 2476 5758 is 2076 5748 holy 40 ground 1093. 

7:34 I have seen 1492 5631, I have seen 1492 5627 the affliction 2561 of my 3450 people 2992 which 3588 is in 1722 Egypt 125, and 2532 I have heard 191 5656 their 846 groaning 4726, and 2532 am come down 2597 5627 to deliver 1807 5641 them 846. And 2532 now 3568 come 1204 5773, I will send 649 5692 thee 4571 into 1519 Egypt 125. 

7:35 This 5126 Moses 3475 whom 3739 they refused 720 5662, saying 2036 5631, Who 5101 made 2525 5656 thee 4571 a ruler 758 and 2532 a judge 1348? the same 5126 did God 2316 send 649 5656 [to be] a ruler 758 and 2532 a deliverer 3086 by 1722 the hand 5495 of the angel 32 which 3588 appeared 3700 5685 to him 846 in 1722 the bush 942. 

7:36 He 3778 brought 1806 0 them 846 out 1806 5627, after that he had shewed 4160 5660 wonders 5059 and 2532 signs 4592 in 1722 the land 1093 of Egypt 125, and 2532 in 1722 the Red 2063 sea 2281, and 2532 in 1722 the wilderness 2048 forty 5062 years 2094. 

7:37 This 3778 is 2076 5748 that Moses 3475, which 3588 said 2036 5631 unto the children 5207 of Israel 2474, A prophet 4396 shall 450 0 the Lord 2962 your 5216 God 2316 raise up 450 5692 unto you 5213 of 1537 your 5216 brethren 80, like 5613 unto me 1691; him 846 shall ye hear 191 5695. 

7:38 This 3778 is he 2076 5748, that was 1096 5637 in 1722 the church 1577 in 1722 the wilderness 2048 with 3326 the angel 32 which 3588 spake 2980 5723 to him 846 in 1722 the mount 3735 Sina 4614, and 2532 [with] our 2257 fathers 3962: who 3739 received 1209 5662 the lively 2198 5723 oracles 3051 to give 1325 5629 unto us 2254: 

7:39 To whom 3739 our 2257 fathers 3962 would 2309 5656 not 3756 obey 1096 5635 5255, but 235 thrust [him] from them 683 5662, and 2532 in their 848 hearts 2588 turned back again 4762 5648 into 1519 Egypt 125, 

7:40 Saying 2036 5631 unto Aaron 2, Make 4160 5657 us 2254 gods 2316 to 3739 go before 4313 5695 us 2257: for 1063 [as for] this 3778 Moses 3475, which 3739 brought 1806 5627 us 2248 out of 1537 the land 1093 of Egypt 125, we wot 1492 5758 not 3756 what 5101 is become 1096 5754 of him 846. 

7:41 And 2532 they made a calf 3447 5656 in 1722 those 1565 days 2250, and 2532 offered 321 5627 sacrifice 2378 unto the idol 1497, and 2532 rejoiced 2165 5712 in 1722 the works 2041 of their own 848 hands 5495. 

7:42 Then 1161 God 2316 turned 4762 5656, and 2532 gave 3860 0 them 846 up 3860 5656 to worship 3000 5721 the host 4756 of heaven 3772; as it 2531 is written 1125 5769 in 1722 the book 976 of the prophets 4396, O ye house 3624 of Israel 2474, have ye offered 3361 4374 5656 to me 3427 slain beasts 4968 and 2532 sacrifices 2378 [by the space of] forty 5062 years 2094 in 1722 the wilderness 2048? 

7:43 Yea 2532, ye took up 353 5627 the tabernacle 4633 of Moloch 3434, and 2532 the star 798 of your 5216 god 2316 Remphan 4481, figures 5179 which 3739 ye made 4160 5656 to worship 4352 5721 them 846: and 2532 I will carry 3351 0 you 5209 away 3351 5692 beyond 1900 Babylon 897. 

7:44 Our 2257 fathers 3962 had 2258 5713 the tabernacle 4633 of witness 3142 1722 in 1722 the wilderness 2048, as 2531 he had appointed 1299 5668, speaking 2980 5723 unto Moses 3475, that he should make 4160 5658 it 846 according 2596 to the fashion 5179 that 3739 he had seen 3708 5715. 

7:45 Which 3739 also 2532 our 2257 fathers 3962 that came 1237 5666 after brought in 1521 5627 with 3326 Jesus 2424 into 1722 the possession 2697 of the Gentiles 1484, whom 3739 God 2316 drave out 1856 5656 before 575 the face 4383 of our 2257 fathers 3962, unto 2193 the days 2250 of David 1138; 

7:46 Who 3739 found 2147 5627 favour 5485 before 1799 God 2316, and 2532 desired 154 5668 to find 2147 5629 a tabernacle 4638 for the God 2316 of Jacob 2384. 

7:47 But 1161 Solomon 4672 built 3618 5656 him 846 an house 3624. 

7:48 Howbeit 235 the most High 5310 dwelleth 2730 5719 not 3756 in 1722 temples 3485 made with hands 5499; as 2531 saith 3004 5719 the prophet 4396, 

7:49 Heaven 3772 [is] my 3427 throne 2362, and 1161 earth 1093 [is] my 3450 footstool 4228 5286: what 4169 house 3624 will ye build 3618 5692 me 3427? saith 3004 5719 the Lord 2962: or 2228 what 5101 [is] the place 5117 of my 3450 rest 2663? 

7:50 Hath 4160 0 not 3780 my 3450 hand 5495 made 4160 5656 all 3956 these things 5023? 

7:51 Ye stiffnecked 4644 and 2532 uncircumcised 564 in heart 2588 and 2532 ears 3775, ye 5210 do 496 0 always 104 resist 496 5719 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151: as 5613 your 5216 fathers 3962 [did], so 2532 [do] ye 5210. 

7:52 Which 5101 of the prophets 4396 have 1377 0 not 3756 your 5216 fathers 3962 persecuted 1377 5656? and 2532 they have slain 615 5656 them which 3588 shewed before 4293 5660 of 4012 the coming 1660 of the Just One 1342; of whom 3739 ye 5210 have been 1096 5769 now 3568 the betrayers 4273 and 2532 murderers 5406: 

7:53 Who 3748 have received 2983 5627 the law 3551 by 1519 the disposition 1296 of angels 32, and 2532 have 5442 0 not 3756 kept 5442 5656 [it]. 

7:54 When 1161 they heard 191 5723 these things 5023, they were cut 1282 5712 to the heart 848 2588, and 2532 they gnashed 1031 5707 on 1909 him 846 with [their] teeth 3599. 

7:55 But 1161 he, being 5225 5723 full 4134 of the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, looked up stedfastly 816 5660 into 1519 heaven 3772, and saw 1492 5627 the glory 1391 of God 2316, and 2532 Jesus 2424 standing 2476 5761 on 1537 the right hand 1188 of God 2316, 

7:56 And 2532 said 2036 5627, Behold 2400 5628, I see 2334 5719 the heavens 3772 opened 455 5772, and 2532 the Son 5207 of man 444 standing 2476 5761 on 1537 the right hand 1188 of God 2316. 

7:57 Then 1161 they cried out 2896 5660 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, and stopped 4912 5627 their 848 ears 3775, and 2532 ran 3729 5656 upon 1909 him 846 with one accord 3661, 

7:58 And 2532 cast 1544 5631 [him] out of 1854 the city 4172, and stoned 3036 5707 [him]: and 2532 the witnesses 3144 laid down 659 5639 their 848 clothes 2440 at 3844 a young man's 3494 feet 4228, whose name was 2564 5746 Saul 4569. 

7:59 And 2532 they stoned 3036 5707 Stephen 4736, calling upon 1941 5734 [God], and 2532 saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962 Jesus 2424, receive 1209 5663 my 3450 spirit 4151. 

7:60 And 1161 he kneeled down 5087 5631 1119, and cried 2896 5656 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, Lord 2962, lay 2476 5661 not 3361 this 5026 sin 266 to their 846 charge. And 2532 when he had said 2036 5631 this 5124, he fell asleep 2837 5681. 

8:1 And 1161 Saul 4569 was 2258 5713 consenting 4909 5723 unto his 846 death 336. And 1161 at 1722 that 1565 time 2250 there was 1096 5633 a great 3173 persecution 1375 against 1909 the church 1577 which 3588 was at 1722 Jerusalem 2414; and 5037 they were 1289 0 all 3956 scattered abroad 1289 5681 throughout 2596 the regions 5561 of Judaea 2449 and 2532 Samaria 4540, except 4133 the apostles 652. 

8:2 And 1161 devout 2126 men 435 carried 4792 5656 Stephen 4736 [to his burial], and 2532 made 4160 5668 great 3173 lamentation 2870 over 1909 him 846. 

8:3 As 1161 for Saul 4569, he made havock 3075 5711 of the church 1577, entering into 1531 5740 5734 every 2596 house 3624, and haling 4951 5723 5037 men 435 and 2532 women 1135 committed 3860 5707 [them] to 1519 prison 5438. 

8:4 Therefore 3767 3303 they that were scattered abroad 1289 5651 went every where 1330 5627 preaching 2097 5734 the word 3056. 

8:5 Then 1161 Philip 5376 went down 2718 5631 to 1519 the city 4172 of Samaria 4540, and preached 2784 5707 Christ 5547 unto them 846. 

8:6 And 5037 the people 3793 with one accord 3661 gave heed 4337 5707 unto those things which Philip 5376 spake 3004 5746 5259, hearing 1722 191 5721 and 2532 seeing 991 5721 the miracles 4592 which 3739 he did 4160 5707. 

8:7 For 1063 unclean 169 spirits 4151, crying 994 5723 with loud 3173 voice 5456, came out 1831 5711 of many 4183 that were possessed 2192 5723 [with them]: and 1161 many 4183 taken with palsies 3886 5772, and 2532 that were lame 5560, were healed 2323 5681. 

8:8 And 2532 there was 1096 5633 great 3173 joy 5479 in 1722 that 1565 city 4172. 

8:9 But 1161 there was a certain 5100 man 435, called 3686 Simon 4613, which beforetime 4391 5707 in 1722 the same city 4172 used sorcery 3096 5723, and 2532 bewitched 1839 5723 the people 1484 of Samaria 4540, giving out 3004 5723 that himself 1438 was 1511 5750 some 5100 great one 3173: 

8:10 To whom 3739 they all 3956 gave heed 4337 5707, from 575 the least 3398 to 2193 the greatest 3173, saying 3004 5723, This man 3778 is 2076 5748 the great 3173 power 1411 of God 2316. 

8:11 And 1161 to him 846 they had regard 4337 5707, because 1223 that of long 2425 time 5550 he had bewitched 1839 5760 them 846 with sorceries 3095. 

8:12 But 1161 when 3753 they believed 4100 5656 Philip 5376 preaching 2097 5734 the things concerning 4012 the kingdom 932 of God 2316, and 2532 the name 3686 of Jesus 2424 Christ 5547, they were baptized 907 5712, both 5037 men 435 and 2532 women 1135. 

8:13 Then 1161 Simon 4613 himself 846 believed 4100 5656 also 2532: and 2532 when he was baptized 907 5685, he continued 2258 5713 4342 5723 with Philip 5376, and 5037 wondered 1839 5710, beholding 2334 5723 the miracles 1411 and 2532 signs 4592 3173 which were done 1096 5740 5625 1096 5740. 

8:14 Now 1161 when the apostles 652 which 3588 were at 1722 Jerusalem 2414 heard 191 5660 that 3754 Samaria 4540 had received 1209 5766 the word 3056 of God 2316, they sent 649 5656 unto 4314 them 846 Peter 4074 and 2532 John 2491: 

8:15 Who 3748, when they were come down 2597 5631, prayed 4336 5662 for 4012 them 846, that 3704 they might receive 2983 5632 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151: 

8:16 (For 1063 as yet 3768 he was 2258 5713 fallen 1968 5761 upon 1909 none 3762 of them 846: only 3440 1161 they were 5225 5707 baptized 907 5772 in 1519 the name 3686 of the Lord 2962 Jesus 2424) 

8:17 Then 5119 laid they 2007 5707 [their] hands 5495 on 1909 them 846, and 2532 they received 2983 5707 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151. 

8:18 And 1161 when Simon 4613 saw 2300 5666 that 3754 through 1223 laying on 1936 of the apostles 652' hands 5495 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 was given 1325 5743, he offered 4374 5656 them 846 money 5536, 

8:19 Saying 3004 5723, Give 1325 5628 me also 2504 this 5026 power 1849, that 2443 on 2007 0 whomsoever 3739 302 I lay 2007 5632 hands 5495, he may receive 2983 5725 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151. 

8:20 But 1161 Peter 4074 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Thy 4675 money 694 perish 1498 5751 1519 684 with 4862 thee 4671, because 3754 thou hast thought 3543 5656 that the gift 1431 of God 2316 may be purchased 2932 5738 with 1223 money 5536. 

8:21 Thou 4671 hast 2076 5748 neither 3756 part 3310 nor 3761 lot 2819 in 1722 this 5129 matter 3056: for 1063 thy 4675 heart 2588 is 2076 5748 not 3756 right 2117 in the sight 1799 of God 2316. 

8:22 Repent 3340 5657 therefore 3767 of 575 this 5026 thy 4675 wickedness 2549, and 2532 pray 1189 5676 God 2316, if 1487 perhaps 686 the thought 1963 of thine 4675 heart 2588 may be forgiven 863 5701 thee 4671. 

8:23 For 1063 I perceive 3708 5719 that thou 4571 art 5607 5752 in 1519 the gall 5521 of bitterness 4088, and 2532 [in] the bond 4886 of iniquity 93. 

8:24 Then 1161 answered 611 5679 Simon 4613, and said 2036 5627, Pray 1189 5676 ye 5210 to 4314 the Lord 2962 for 5228 me 1700, that 3704 none of these things 3367 which 3739 ye have spoken 2046 5758 come 1904 5632 upon 1909 me 1691. 

8:25 And they, when 3303 3767 they had testified 1263 5666 and 2532 preached 2980 5660 the word 3056 of the Lord 2962, returned 5290 5656 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419, and 5037 preached the gospel 2097 5668 in many 4183 villages 2968 of the Samaritans 4541. 

8:26 And 1161 the angel 32 of the Lord 2962 spake 2980 5656 unto 4314 Philip 5376, saying 3004 5723, Arise 450 5628, and 2532 go 4198 5737 toward 2596 the south 3314 unto 1909 the way 3598 that goeth down 2597 5723 from 575 Jerusalem 2419 unto 1519 Gaza 1048, which 3778 is 2076 5748 desert 2048. 

8:27 And 2532 he arose 450 5631 and went 4198 5675: and 2532, behold 2400 5628, a man 435 of Ethiopia 128, an eunuch 2135 of great authority 1413 under Candace 2582 queen 938 of the Ethiopians 128, who 3739 had 2258 5713 the charge of 1909 all 3956 her 846 treasure 1047, and had come 2064 5715 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419 for to worship 4352 5694, 

8:28 5037 Was 2258 5713 returning 5290 5723, and 2532 sitting 2521 5740 in 1909 his 848 chariot 716 2532 read 314 5707 Esaias 2268 the prophet 4396. 

8:29 Then 1161 the Spirit 4151 said 2036 5627 unto Philip 5376, Go near 4334 5628, and 2532 join thyself to 2853 5682 this 5129 chariot 716. 

8:30 And 1161 Philip 5376 ran 4370 5631 thither to [him], and heard 191 5656 him 846 read 314 5723 the prophet 4396 Esaias 2268, and 2532 said 2036 5627, Understandest thou 687 1065 1097 5719 what 3739 thou readest 314 5719? 

8:31 And 1161 he said 2036 5627, How 1063 4459 can I 302 1410 5739, except 3362 some man 5100 should guide 3594 5661 me 3165? And 5037 he desired 3870 5656 Philip 5376 that he would come up 305 5631 and sit 2523 5658 with 4862 him 846. 

8:32 1161 The place 4042 of the scripture 1124 which 3739 he read 314 5707 was 2258 5713 this 3778, He was led 71 5681 as 5613 a sheep 4263 to 1909 the slaughter 4967; and 2532 like 5613 a lamb 286 dumb 880 before 1726 his 846 shearer 2751 5723, so 3779 opened he 455 5719 not 3756 his 848 mouth 4750: 

8:33 In 1722 his 846 humiliation 5014 his 846 judgment 2920 was taken away 142 5681: and 1161 who 5101 shall declare 1334 5695 his 846 generation 1074? for 3754 his 846 life 2222 is taken 142 5743 from 575 the earth 1093. 

8:34 And 1161 the eunuch 2135 answered 611 5679 Philip 5376, and said 2036 5627, I pray 1189 5736 thee 4675, of 4012 whom 5101 speaketh 3004 5719 the prophet 4396 this 5124? of 4012 himself 1438, or 2228 of 4012 some 5100 other man 2087? 

8:35 Then 1161 Philip 5376 opened 455 5660 his 848 mouth 4750, and 2532 began 756 5671 at 575 the same 5026 scripture 1124, and preached 2097 5668 unto him 846 Jesus 2424. 

8:36 And 1161 as 5613 they went 4198 5711 on 2596 [their] way 3598, they came 2064 5627 unto 1909 a certain 5100 water 5204: and 2532 the eunuch 2135 said 5346 5748, See 2400 5628, [here is] water 5204; what 5101 doth hinder 2967 5719 me 3165 to be baptized 907 5683? 

8:37 And 1161 Philip 5376 said 2036 5627, If 1487 thou believest 4100 5719 with 1537 all thine 3650 heart 2588, thou mayest 1832 5748. And 1161 he answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, I believe 4100 5719 that Jesus 2424 Christ 5547 is 1511 5750 the Son 5207 of God 2316. 

8:38 And 2532 he commanded 2753 5656 the chariot 716 to stand still 2476 5629: and 2532 they went down 2597 5627 both 297 into 1519 the water 5204, both 5037 Philip 5376 and 2532 the eunuch 2135; and 2532 he baptized 907 5656 him 846. 

8:39 And 1161 when 3753 they were come up 305 5627 out of 1537 the water 5204, the Spirit 4151 of the Lord 2962 caught away 726 5656 Philip 5376, 2532 that the eunuch 2135 saw 1492 5627 3756 him 846 no more 3765: and 1063 he went 4198 5711 on his 848 way 3598 rejoicing 5463 5723. 

8:40 But 1161 Philip 5376 was found 2147 5681 at 1519 Azotus 108: and 2532 passing 1330 5740 through he preached 2097 5710 in all 3956 the cities 4172, till 2193 he 846 came 2064 5629 to 1519 Caesarea 2542. 

9:1 And 1161 Saul 4569, yet 2089 breathing out 1709 5723 threatenings 547 and 2532 slaughter 5408 against 1519 the disciples 3101 of the Lord 2962, went 4334 5631 unto the high priest 749, 

9:2 And desired 154 5668 of 3844 him 846 letters 1992 to 1519 Damascus 1154 to 4314 the synagogues 4864, that 3704 if 1437 he found 2147 5632 any 5100 of this way 3598, whether 5037 they were 5607 5752 men 435 or 2532 women 1135, he might bring them 71 5632 bound 1210 5772 unto 1519 Jerusalem 2419. 

9:3 And 1161 as he 846 journeyed 4198 5738 1722, he came 1096 5633 near 1448 5721 Damascus 1154: and 2532 suddenly 1810 there shined round about 4015 5656 him 846 a light 5457 from 575 heaven 3772: 

9:4 And 2532 he fell 4098 5631 to 1909 the earth 1093, and heard 191 5656 a voice 5456 saying 3004 5723 unto him 848, Saul 4549, Saul 4549, why 5101 persecutest thou 1377 5719 me 3165? 

9:5 And 1161 he said 2036 5627, Who 5101 art thou 1488 5748, Lord 2962? And 1161 the Lord 2962 said 2036 5627, I 1473 am 1510 5748 Jesus 2424 whom 3739 thou 4771 persecutest 1377 5719: [it is] hard 4642 for thee 4671 to kick 2979 5721 against 4314 the pricks 2759. 

9:6 And 5037 he trembling 5141 5723 and 2532 astonished 2284 5723 said 2036 5627, Lord 2962, what 5101 wilt thou have 2309 5719 me 3165 to do 4160 5658? And 2532 the Lord 2962 [said] unto 4314 him 846, Arise 450 5628, and 2532 go 1525 5628 into 1519 the city 4172, and 2532 it shall be told 2980 5701 thee 4671 what 5101 thou 4571 must 1163 5748 do 4160 5721. 

9:7 And 1161 the men 435 which 3588 journeyed 4922 5723 with him 846 stood 2476 5715 speechless 1769, hearing 191 5723 3303 a voice 5456, but 1161 seeing 2334 5723 no man 3367. 

9:8 And 1161 Saul 4569 arose 1453 5681 from 575 the earth 1093; and 1161 when his 848 eyes 3788 were opened 455 5772, he saw 991 5707 no man 3762: but 1161 they led 5496 0 him 846 by the hand 5496 5723, and brought 1521 5627 [him] into 1519 Damascus 1154. 

9:9 And 2532 he was 2258 5713 three 5140 days 2250 without 3361 sight 991 5723, and 2532 neither 3756 did eat 5315 5627 nor 3761 drink 4095 5627. 

9:10 And 1161 there was 2258 5713 a certain 5100 disciple 3101 at 1722 Damascus 1154, named 3686 Ananias 367; and 2532 to 4314 him 846 said 2036 5627 the Lord 2962 in 1722 a vision 3705, Ananias 367. And 1161 he said 2036 5627, Behold 2400 5628, I 1473 [am here], Lord 2962. 

9:11 And 1161 the Lord 2962 [said] unto 4314 him 846, Arise 450 5631, and go 4198 5676 into 1909 the street 4505 which 3588 is called 2564 5746 Straight 2117, and 2532 enquire 2212 5657 in 1722 the house 3614 of Judas 2455 for [one] called 3686 Saul 4569, of Tarsus 5018: for 1063, behold 2400 5628, he prayeth 4336 5736, 

9:12 And 2532 hath seen 1492 5627 in 1722 a vision 3705 a man 435 named 3686 Ananias 367 coming in 1525 5631, and 2532 putting 2007 0 [his] hand 5495 on 2007 5631 him 846, that 3704 he might receive his sight 308 5661. 

9:13 Then 1161 Ananias 367 answered 611 5662, Lord 2962, I have heard 191 5754 by 575 many 4183 of 4012 this 5127 man 435, how much 3745 evil 2556 he hath done 4160 5656 to thy 4675 saints 40 at 1722 Jerusalem 2419: 

9:14 And 2532 here 5602 he hath 2192 5719 authority 1849 from 3844 the chief priests 749 to bind 1210 5658 all 3956 that call 1941 5734 on thy 4675 name 3686. 

9:15 But 1161 the Lord 2962 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Go thy way 4198 5737: for 3754 he 3778 is 2076 5748 a chosen 1589 vessel 4632 unto me 3427, to bear 941 5658 my 3450 name 3686 before 1799 the Gentiles 1484, and 2532 kings 935, and 5037 the children 5207 of Israel 2474: 

9:16 For 1063 I 1473 will shew 5263 5692 him 846 how great things 3745 he 846 must 1163 5748 suffer 3958 5629 for 5228 0 my 3450 name's sake 3686 5228. 

9:17 And 1161 Ananias 367 went his way 565 5627, and 2532 entered 1525 5627 into 1519 the house 3614; and 2532 putting 2007 5631 his hands 5495 on 1909 him 846 said 2036 5627, Brother 80 Saul 4549, the Lord 2962, [even] Jesus 2424, that appeared 3700 5685 unto thee 4671 in 1722 the way 3598 as 3739 thou camest 2064 5711, hath sent 649 5758 me 3165, that 3704 thou mightest receive thy sight 308 5661, and 2532 be filled with 4130 5686 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151. 

9:18 And 2532 immediately 2112 there fell 634 5627 from 575 his 846 eyes 3788 as 5616 it had been scales 3013: and he received sight 308 5656 forthwith 3916, and 5037 arose 450 5631, and 2532 was baptized 907 5681. 

9:19 And 2532 when he had received 2983 5631 meat 5160, he was strengthened 1765 5656. Then 1161 was 1096 5633 Saul 4569 certain 5100 days 2250 with 3326 the disciples 3101 which were at 1722 Damascus 1154. 

9:20 And 2532 straightway 2112 he preached 2784 5707 Christ 5547 in 1722 the synagogues 4864, that 3754 he 3778 is 2076 5748 the Son 5207 of God 2316. 

9:21 But 1161 all 3956 that heard 191 5723 [him] were amazed 1839 5710, and 2532 said 3004 5707; Is 2076 5748 not 3756 this 3778 he that destroyed 4199 5660 them which 3588 called on 1941 5734 this 5124 name 3686 in 1722 Jerusalem 2419, and 2532 came 2064 5715 hither 5602 for 1519 0 that 5124 intent 1519, that 2443 he might bring 71 5632 them 846 bound 1210 5772 unto 1909 the chief priests 749? 

9:22 But 1161 Saul 4569 increased 1743 0 the more 3123 in strength 1743 5712, and 2532 confounded 4797 5707 the Jews 2453 which 3588 dwelt 2730 5723 at 1722 Damascus 1154, proving 4822 5723 that 3754 this 3778 is 2076 5748 very 846 Christ 5547. 

9:23 And 1161 after 5613 that many 2425 days 2250 were fulfilled 4137 5712, the Jews 2453 took counsel 4823 5668 to kill 337 5629 him 846: 

9:24 But 1161 their 846 laying await 1917 was known 1097 5681 of Saul 4569. And 5037 they watched 3906 5707 the gates 4439 day 2250 and 2532 night 3571 to 3704 kill 337 5661 him 846. 

9:25 Then 1161 the disciples 3101 took 2983 5631 him 846 by night 3571, and let [him] down 2524 5656 5465 5660 by 1223 the wall 5038 in 1722 a basket 4711. 

9:26 And 1161 when Saul 4569 was come 3854 5637 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419, he assayed 3987 5711 to join himself 2853 5745 to the disciples 3101: but 2532 they were 5399 0 all 3956 afraid 5399 5711 of him 846, and believed 4100 5723 not 3361 that 3754 he was 2076 5748 a disciple 3101. 

9:27 But 1161 Barnabas 921 took 1949 5637 him 846, and brought 71 5627 [him] to 4314 the apostles 652, and 2532 declared 1334 5662 unto them 846 how 4459 he had seen 1492 5627 the Lord 2962 in 1722 the way 3598, and 2532 that 3754 he had spoken 2980 5656 to him 846, and 2532 how 4459 he had preached boldly 3955 5662 at 1722 Damascus 1154 in 1722 the name 3686 of Jesus 2424. 

9:28 And 2532 he was 2258 5713 with 3326 them 846 coming in 1531 5740 5734 and 2532 going out 1607 5740 at 1722 Jerusalem 2419. 

9:29 And 2532 he spake 2980 5707 boldly 3955 5740 in 1722 the name 3686 of the Lord 2962 Jesus 2424, and 5037 2532 disputed 4802 5707 against 4314 the Grecians 1675: but 1161 they went about 2021 5707 to slay 337 5629 him 846. 

9:30 [Which] when 1161 the brethren 80 knew 1921 5631, they brought 2609 0 him 846 down 2609 5627 to 1519 Caesarea 2542, and 2532 sent 1821 0 him 846 forth 1821 5656 to 1519 Tarsus 5019. 

9:31 Then 3303 3767 had 2192 5707 the churches 1577 rest 1515 throughout 2596 all 3650 Judaea 2449 and 2532 Galilee 1056 and 2532 Samaria 4540, and were edified 3618 5746; and 2532 walking in 4198 5740 the fear 5401 of the Lord 2962, and 2532 in the comfort 3874 of the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, were multiplied 4129 5712. 

9:32 And 1161 it came 1096 5633 to pass, as 1330 0 Peter 4074 passed throughout 1330 5740 1223 all 3956 [quarters], he came down 2718 5629 also 2532 to 4314 the saints 40 which 3588 dwelt 2730 5723 at Lydda 3069. 

9:33 And 1161 there 1563 he found 2147 5627 a certain 5100 man 444 named 3686 Aeneas 132, which had kept 2621 5740 1909 his bed 2895 1537 eight 3638 years 2094, and 3739 was 2258 5713 sick of the palsy 3886 5772. 

9:34 And 2532 Peter 4074 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Aeneas 132, Jesus 2424 Christ 5547 maketh 2390 0 thee 4571 whole 2390 5736: arise 450 5628, and 2532 make 4766 0 thy 4572 bed 4766 5657. And 2532 he arose 450 5627 immediately 2112. 

9:35 And 2532 all 3956 that dwelt 2730 5723 at Lydda 3069 and 2532 Saron 4565 saw 1492 5627 him 846, and 3748 turned 1994 5656 to 1909 the Lord 2962. 

9:36 Now 1161 there was 2258 5713 at 1722 Joppa 2445 a certain 5100 disciple 3102 named 3686 Tabitha 5000, which 3739 by interpretation 1329 5746 is called 3004 5743 Dorcas 1393: this woman 3778 was 2258 5713 full 4134 of good 18 works 2041 and 2532 almsdeeds 1654 which 3739 she did 4160 5707. 

9:37 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633 in 1722 those 1565 days 2250, that she was sick 770 5660, and died 599 5629: whom when 1161 they 846 had washed 3068 5660, they laid 5087 5656 [her] in 1722 an upper chamber 5253. 

9:38 And 1161 forasmuch as 5607 5752 Lydda 3069 was nigh 1451 to Joppa 2445, and the disciples 3101 had heard 191 5660 that 3754 Peter 4074 was 2076 5748 there 1722 846, they sent 649 5656 unto 4314 him 846 two 1417 men 435, desiring 3870 5723 [him] that he would 3635 0 not 3361 delay 3635 5658 to come 1330 5629 to 2193 them 846. 

9:39 Then 1161 Peter 4074 arose 450 5631 and went with 4905 5627 them 846. When he 3739 was come 3854 5637, they brought him 321 5627 into 1519 the upper chamber 5253: and 2532 all 3956 the widows 5503 stood by 3936 5656 him 846 weeping 2799 5723, and 2532 shewing 1925 5734 the coats 5509 and 2532 garments 2440 which 3745 Dorcas 1393 made 4160 5707, while she was 5607 5752 with 3326 them 846. 

9:40 But 1161 Peter 4074 put 1544 5631 them all 3956 forth 1854, and kneeled down 5087 5631 1119, and prayed 4336 5662; and 2532 turning 1994 5660 [him] to 4314 the body 4983 said 2036 5627, Tabitha 5000, arise 450 5628. And 1161 she opened 455 5656 her 848 eyes 3788: and 2532 when she saw 1492 5631 Peter 4074, she sat up 339 5656. 

9:41 And 1161 he gave 1325 5631 her 846 [his] hand 5495, and lifted 450 0 her 846 up 450 5656, and 1161 when he had called 5455 5660 the saints 40 and 2532 widows 5503, presented 3936 5656 her 846 alive 2198 5723. 

9:42 And 1161 it was 1096 5633 known 1110 throughout 2596 all 3650 Joppa 2445; and 2532 many 4183 believed 4100 5656 in 1909 the Lord 2962. 

9:43 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, that he tarried 3306 5658 many 2425 days 2250 in 1722 Joppa 2445 with 3844 one 5100 Simon 4613 a tanner 1038. 

10:1 1161 There was 2258 5713 a certain 5100 man 435 in 1722 Caesarea 2542 called 3686 Cornelius 2883, a centurion 1543 of 1537 the band 4686 called 2564 5746 the Italian 2483 [band], 

10:2 [A] devout 2152 [man], and 2532 one that feared 5399 5740 God 2316 with 4862 all 3956 his 848 house 3624, which 5037 gave 4160 5723 much 4183 alms 1654 to the people 2992, and 2532 prayed 1189 5740 to God 2316 alway 1275. 

10:3 He saw 1492 5627 in 1722 a vision 3705 evidently 5320 about 5616 the ninth 1766 hour 5610 of the day 2250 an angel 32 of God 2316 coming in 1525 5631 to 4314 him 846, and 2532 saying 2036 5631 unto him 846, Cornelius 2883. 

10:4 And 1161 when he looked 816 5660 on him 846, he was 1096 5637 afraid 1719, and 2532 said 2036 5627, What 5101 is it 2076 5748, Lord 2962? And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Thy 4675 prayers 4335 and 2532 thine 4675 alms 1654 are come up 305 5627 for 1519 a memorial 3422 before 1799 God 2316. 

10:5 And 2532 now 3568 send 3992 5657 men 435 to 1519 Joppa 2445, and 2532 call for 3343 5663 [one] Simon 4613, whose 3739 surname is 1941 5743 Peter 4074: 

10:6 He 3778 lodgeth 3579 5743 with 3844 one 5100 Simon 4613 a tanner 1038, whose 3739 house 3614 is 2076 5748 by 3844 the sea side 2281: he 3778 shall tell 2980 5692 thee 4671 what 5101 thou 4571 oughtest 1163 5748 to do 4160 5721. 

10:7 And 1161 when 5613 the angel 32 which 3588 spake 2980 5723 unto Cornelius 2883 was departed 565 5627, he called 5455 5660 two 1417 of his 848 household servants 3610, and 2532 a devout 2152 soldier 4757 of them that waited on 4342 0 him 846 continually 4342 5723; 

10:8 And 2532 when he had declared 1834 5666 all [these] things 537 unto them 846, he sent 649 5656 them 846 to 1519 Joppa 2445. 

10:9 1161 On the morrow 1887, as they 1565 went on their journey 3596 5723, and 2532 drew nigh 1448 5723 unto the city 4172, Peter 4074 went up 305 5627 upon 1909 the housetop 1430 to pray 4336 5664 about 4012 the sixth 1623 hour 5610: 

10:10 And 1161 he became 1096 5633 very hungry 4361, and 2532 would 2309 5707 have eaten 1089 5664: but 1161 while they 1565 made ready 3903 5723, he 846 fell 1968 5627 into 1909 a trance 1611, 

10:11 And 2532 saw 2334 5719 heaven 3772 opened 455 5772, and 2532 a certain 5100 vessel 4632 descending 2597 5723 unto 1909 him 846, as 5613 it had been a great 3173 sheet 3607 knit 1210 5772 at the four 5064 corners 746, and 2532 let down 2524 5746 to 1909 the earth 1093: 

10:12 Wherein 1722 3739 were 5225 5707 all manner 3956 of fourfooted beasts 5074 of the earth 1093, and 2532 wild beasts 2342, and 2532 creeping things 2062, and 2532 fowls 4071 of the air 3772. 

10:13 And 2532 there came 1096 5633 a voice 5456 to 4314 him 846, Rise 450 5631, Peter 4074; kill 2380 5657, and 2532 eat 5315 5628. 

10:14 But 1161 Peter 4074 said 2036 5627, Not so 3365, Lord 2962; for 3754 I have 5315 0 never 3763 eaten 5315 5627 any thing 3956 that is common 2839 or 2228 unclean 169. 

10:15 And 2532 the voice 5456 [spake] unto 4314 him 846 again 3825 1537 the second time 1208, What 3739 God 2316 hath cleansed 2511 5656, [that] call 2840 0 not 3361 thou 4771 common 2840 5720. 

10:16 1161 This 5124 was done 1096 5633 thrice 1909 5151: and 2532 the vessel 4632 was received up 353 5681 again 3825 into 1519 heaven 3772. 

10:17 Now 1161 while 5613 Peter 4074 doubted 1280 5707 in 1722 himself 1438 what 5101 this vision 3705 which 3739 he had seen 1492 5627 should mean 302 1498 5751, behold 2400 5628 2532, the men 435 which 3588 were sent 649 5772 from 575 Cornelius 2883 had made enquiry 1331 5660 for Simon's 4613 house 3614, and stood 2186 5627 before 1909 the gate 4440, 

10:18 And 2532 called 5455 5660, and asked 4441 5711 whether 1487 Simon 4613, which 3588 was surnamed 1941 5746 Peter 4074, were lodged 3579 5743 there 1759. 

10:19 While 1161 Peter 4074 thought 1760 5740 on 4012 the vision 3705, the Spirit 4151 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Behold 2400 5628, three 5140 men 435 seek 2212 5719 thee 4571. 

10:20 Arise 450 5631 therefore 235, and get thee down 2597 5628, and 2532 go 4198 5737 with 4862 them 846, doubting 1252 5734 nothing 3367: for 1360 I 1473 have sent 649 5758 them 846. 

10:21 Then 1161 Peter 4074 went down 2597 5631 to 4314 the men 435 which 3588 were sent 649 5772 unto 4314 him 846 from 575 Cornelius 2883; and said 2036 5627, Behold 2400 5628, I 1473 am 1510 5748 he whom 3739 ye seek 2212 5719: what 5101 [is] the cause 156 wherefore 1223 3739 ye are come 3918 5748? 

10:22 And 1161 they said 2036 5627, Cornelius 2883 the centurion 1543, a just 1342 man 435, and 2532 one that feareth 5399 5740 God 2316, and 5037 of good report 3140 5746 among 5259 all 3650 the nation 1484 of the Jews 2453, was warned from God 5537 5681 by 5259 an holy 40 angel 32 to send 3343 5664 for thee 4571 into 1519 his 848 house 3624, and 2532 to hear 191 5658 words 4487 of 3844 thee 4675. 

10:23 Then 3767 called he 1528 0 them 846 in 1528 5662, and lodged 3579 5656 [them]. And 1161 on the morrow 1887 Peter 4074 went away 1831 5627 with 4862 them 846, and 2532 certain 5100 brethren 80 from 575 Joppa 2445 accompanied 4905 5627 him 846. 

10:24 And 2532 the morrow 1887 after they entered 1525 5627 into 1519 Caesarea 2542. And 1161 Cornelius 2883 waited for 4328 5723 them 846 2258 5713, and had called together 4779 5671 his 848 kinsmen 4773 and 2532 near 316 friends 5384. 

10:25 And 1161 as 5613 Peter 4074 was 1096 5633 coming in 1525 5629, Cornelius 2883 met 4876 5660 him 846, and fell down 4098 5631 at 1909 his feet 4228, and worshipped 4352 5656 [him]. 

10:26 But 1161 Peter 4074 took 1453 0 him 846 up 1453 5656, saying 3004 5723, Stand up 450 5628; I 2504 0 myself 846 also 2504 am 1510 5748 a man 444. 

10:27 And 2532 as he talked 4926 5723 with him 846, he went in 1525 5627, and 2532 found 2147 5719 many 4183 that were come together 4905 5761. 

10:28 And 5037 he said 5346 5713 unto 4314 them 846, Ye 5210 know 1987 5736 how 5613 that it is 2076 5748 an unlawful thing 111 for a man 435 that is a Jew 2453 to keep company 2853 5745, or 2228 come unto 4334 5738 one of another nation 246; but 2532 God 2316 hath shewed 1166 5656 me 1698 that I should not 3367 0 call 3004 5721 any 3367 man 444 common 2839 or 2228 unclean 169. 

10:29 Therefore 1352 2532 came I 2064 5627 [unto you] without gainsaying 369, as soon as I was sent for 3343 5685: I ask 4441 5736 therefore 3767 for what 5101 intent 3056 ye have sent for 3343 5662 me 3165? 

10:30 And 2532 Cornelius 2883 said 5346 5713, Four 5067 days 2250 ago 575 I was 2252 5713 fasting 3522 5723 until 3360 this 5026 hour 5610; and 2532 at the ninth 1766 hour 5610 I prayed 4336 5740 in 1722 my 3450 house 3624, and 2532, behold 2400 5628, a man 435 stood 2476 5627 before 1799 me 3450 in 1722 bright 2986 clothing 2066, 

10:31 And 2532 said 5346 5748, Cornelius 2883, thy 4675 prayer 4335 is heard 1522 5681, and 2532 thine 4675 alms 1654 are had in remembrance 3415 5681 in the sight 1799 of God 2316. 

10:32 Send 3992 5657 therefore 3767 to 1519 Joppa 2445, and 2532 call hither 3333 5669 Simon 4613, whose 3739 surname is 1941 5743 Peter 4074; he 3778 is lodged 3579 5743 in 1722 the house 3614 of [one] Simon 4613 a tanner 1038 by 3844 the sea side 2281: who 3739, when he cometh 3854 5637, shall speak 2980 5692 unto thee 4671. 

10:33 Immediately 1824 therefore 3767 I sent 3992 5656 to 4314 thee 4571; and 5037 thou 4771 hast well 2573 done 4160 5656 that thou art come 3854 5637. Now 3568 therefore 3767 are 3918 0 we 2249 all 3956 here present 3918 5748 before 1799 God 2316, to hear 191 5658 all things 3956 that are commanded 4367 5772 thee 4671 of 5259 God 2316. 

10:34 Then 1161 Peter 4074 opened 455 5660 [his] mouth 4750, and said 2036 5627, Of 1909 a truth 225 I perceive 2638 5731 that 3754 God 2316 is 2076 5748 no 3756 respecter of persons 4381: 

10:35 But 235 in 1722 every 3956 nation 1484 he that feareth 5399 5740 him 846, and 2532 worketh 2038 5740 righteousness 1343, is 2076 5748 accepted 1184 with him 846. 

10:36 The word 3056 which 3739 [God] sent 649 5656 unto the children 5207 of Israel 2474, preaching 2097 5734 peace 1515 by 1223 Jesus 2424 Christ 5547: (he 3778 is 2076 5748 Lord 2962 of all 3956) 

10:37 That word 4487, [I say], ye 5210 know 1492 5758, which was published 1096 5637 throughout 2596 all 3650 Judaea 2449, and began 756 5671 from 575 Galilee 1056, after 3326 the baptism 908 which 3739 John 2491 preached 2784 5656; 

10:38 How 5613 God 2316 anointed 5548 5656 Jesus 2424 of 575 Nazareth 3478 with the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 and 2532 with power 1411: who 846 3739 went about 1330 5627 doing good 2109 5723, and 2532 healing 2390 5740 all 3956 that were oppressed 2616 5746 of 5259 the devil 1228; for 3754 God 2316 was 2258 5713 with 3326 him 846. 

10:39 And 2532 we 2249 are 2070 5748 witnesses 3144 of all things 3956 which 3739 he did 4160 5656 both 5037 in 1722 the land 5561 of the Jews 2453, and 2532 in 1722 Jerusalem 2419; whom 3739 they slew 337 5627 and hanged 2910 5660 on 1909 a tree 3586: 

10:40 Him 5126 God 2316 raised up 1453 5656 the third 5154 day 2250, and 2532 shewed 1096 5635 him 846 openly 1717 1325 5656; 

10:41 Not 3756 to all 3956 the people 2992, but 235 unto witnesses 3144 chosen before 4401 5772 of 5259 God 2316, [even] to us 2254, who 3748 did eat 4906 5627 and 2532 drink with 4844 5627 him 846 after 3326 he 846 rose 450 5629 from 1537 the dead 3498. 

10:42 And 2532 he commanded 3853 5656 us 2254 to preach 2784 5658 unto the people 2992, and 2532 to testify 1263 5664 that 3754 it is 2076 5748 he 846 which 3588 was ordained 3724 5772 of 5259 God 2316 [to be] the Judge 2923 of quick 2198 5723 and 2532 dead 3498. 

10:43 To him 5129 give 3140 0 all 3956 the prophets 4396 witness 3140 5719, that through 1223 his 846 name 3686 whosoever 3956 believeth 4100 5723 in 1519 him 846 shall receive 2983 5629 remission 859 of sins 266. 

10:44 While Peter 4074 yet 2089 spake 2980 5723 these 5023 words 4487, the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 fell 1968 5627 on 1909 all 3956 them which heard 191 5723 the word 3056. 

10:45 And 2532 they of 1537 the circumcision 4061 which believed 4103 were astonished 1839 5627, as many as 3745 came with 4905 5627 Peter 4074, because 3754 that on 1909 the Gentiles 1484 also 2532 was poured out 1632 5769 the gift 1431 of the Holy 40 Ghost 4151. 

10:46 For 1063 they heard 191 5707 them 846 speak with 2980 5723 tongues 1100, and 2532 magnify 3170 5723 God 2316. Then 5119 answered 611 5662 Peter 4074, 

10:47 Can 3385 1410 5736 any man 5100 forbid 2967 5658 water 5204, that these 5128 should 907 0 not 3361 be baptized 907 5683, which 3748 have received 2983 5627 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 as 2532 well as 2531 we 2249? 

10:48 And 5037 he commanded 4367 5656 them 846 to be baptized 907 5683 in 1722 the name 3686 of the Lord 2962. Then 5119 prayed they 2065 5656 him 846 to tarry 1961 5658 certain 5100 days 2250. 

11:1 And 1161 the apostles 652 and 2532 brethren 80 that were 5607 5752 in 2596 Judaea 2449 heard 191 5656 that 3754 the Gentiles 1484 had 1209 0 also 2532 received 1209 5662 the word 3056 of God 2316. 

11:2 And 2532 when 3753 Peter 4074 was come up 305 5627 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414, they that were of 1537 the circumcision 4061 contended 1252 5710 with 4314 him 846, 

11:3 Saying 3004 5723, 3754 Thou wentest in 1525 5627 to 4314 men 435 uncircumcised 203 2192 5723, and 2532 didst eat 4906 5627 with them 846. 

11:4 But 1161 Peter 4074 rehearsed [the matter] from the beginning 756 5671, and expounded 1620 5710 [it] by order 2517 unto them 846, saying 3004 5723, 

11:5 I 1473 was 2252 5713 in 1722 the city 4172 of Joppa 2445 praying 4336 5740: and 2532 in 1722 a trance 1611 I saw 1492 5627 a vision 3705, A certain 5100 vessel 4632 descend 2597 5723, as it had been 5613 a great 3173 sheet 3607, let down 2524 5746 from 1537 heaven 3772 by four 5064 corners 746; and 2532 it came 2064 5627 even 891 to me 1700: 

11:6 Upon 1519 the which 3739 when I had fastened mine eyes 816 5660, I considered 2657 5707, and 2532 saw 1492 5627 fourfooted beasts 5074 of the earth 1093, and 2532 wild beasts 2342, and 2532 creeping things 2062, and 2532 fowls 4071 of the air 3772. 

11:7 And 1161 I heard 191 5656 a voice 5456 saying 3004 5723 unto me 3427, Arise 450 5631, Peter 4074; slay 2380 5657 and 2532 eat 5315 5628. 

11:8 But 1161 I said 2036 5627, Not so 3365, Lord 2962: for 3754 nothing 3956 common 2839 or 2228 unclean 169 hath 1525 0 at any time 3763 entered 1525 5627 into 1519 my 3450 mouth 4750. 

11:9 But 1161 the voice 5456 answered 611 5662 me 3427 again 1537 1208 from 1537 heaven 3772, What 3739 God 2316 hath cleansed 2511 5656, [that] call 2840 0 not 3361 thou 4771 common 2840 5720. 

11:10 And 1161 this 5124 was done 1096 5633 1909 three times 5151: and 2532 all 537 were drawn up 385 5681 again 3825 into 1519 heaven 3772. 

11:11 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, immediately 1824 0 there were 2186 0 three 5140 men 435 already 1824 come 2186 5627 unto 1909 the house 3614 where 1722 3739 3739 I was 2252 5713, sent 649 5772 from 575 Caesarea 2542 unto 4314 me 3165. 

11:12 And 1161 the Spirit 4151 bade 2036 5627 me 3427 go with 4905 5629 them 846, nothing 3367 doubting 1252 5734. Moreover 1161 2532 these 3778 six 1803 brethren 80 accompanied 4862 2064 5627 me 1698, and 2532 we entered 1525 5627 into 1519 the man's 435 house 3624: 

11:13 And 5037 he shewed 518 5656 us 2254 how 4459 he had seen 1492 5627 an angel 32 in 1722 his 846 house 3624, which stood 2476 5685 and 2532 said 2036 5631 unto him 846, Send 649 5657 men 435 to 1519 Joppa 2445, and 2532 call for 3343 5663 Simon 4613, whose surname is 1941 5746 Peter 4074; 

11:14 Who 3739 shall tell 2980 5692 thee 4314 4571 words 4487, whereby 1722 3739 thou 4771 and 2532 all 3956 thy 4675 house 3624 shall be saved 4982 5701. 

11:15 And 1161 as 1722 I 3165 began 756 5670 to speak 2980 5721, the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 fell 1968 5627 on 1909 them 846, as 5618 2532 on 1909 us 2248 at 1722 the beginning 746. 

11:16 Then 1161 remembered I 3415 5681 the word 4487 of the Lord 2962, how 5613 that he said 3004 5707, John 2491 indeed 3303 baptized with 907 5656 water 5204; but 1161 ye 5210 shall be baptized 907 5701 with 1722 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151. 

11:17 Forasmuch 1487 then 3767 as 5613 God 2316 gave 1325 5656 them 846 the like 2470 gift 1431 as 2532 [he did] unto us 2254, who believed 4100 5660 on 1909 the Lord 2962 Jesus 2424 Christ 5547; 1161 what 5101 was 2252 5713 I 1473, that I could 1415 withstand 2967 5658 God 2316? 

11:18 When 1161 they heard 191 5660 these things 5023, they held their peace 2270 5656, and 2532 glorified 1392 5707 God 2316, saying 3004 5723, Then 686 hath 1325 0 1065 God 2316 also 2532 to the Gentiles 1484 granted 1325 5656 repentance 3341 unto 1519 life 2222. 

11:19 Now 3767 3303 they which were scattered abroad 1289 5651 upon 575 the persecution 2347 that arose 1096 5637 about 1909 Stephen 4736 travelled 1330 5627 as far as 2193 Phenice 5403, and 2532 Cyprus 2954, and 2532 Antioch 490, preaching 2980 5723 the word 3056 to none 3367 but 1508 unto the Jews 2453 only 3440. 

11:20 And 1161 some 5100 of 1537 them 846 were 2258 5713 men 435 of Cyprus 2953 and 2532 Cyrene 2956, which 3748, when they were come 1525 5631 to 1519 Antioch 490, spake 2980 5707 unto 4314 the Grecians 1675, preaching 2097 5734 the Lord 2962 Jesus 2424. 

11:21 And 2532 the hand 5495 of the Lord 2962 was 2258 5713 with 3326 them 846: and 5037 a great 4183 number 706 believed 4100 5660, and turned 1994 5656 unto 1909 the Lord 2962. 

11:22 Then 1161 tidings 3056 of 4012 these things 846 came 191 5681 unto 1519 the ears 3775 of the church 1577 which 3588 was in 1722 Jerusalem 2414: and 2532 they sent forth 1821 5656 Barnabas 921, that he should go 1330 5629 as far as 2193 Antioch 490. 

11:23 Who 3739, when he came 3854 5637, and 2532 had seen 1492 5631 the grace 5485 of God 2316, was glad 5463 5644, and 2532 exhorted 3870 5707 them all 3956, that with purpose 4286 of heart 2588 they would cleave unto 4357 5721 the Lord 2962. 

11:24 For 3754 he was 2258 5713 a good 18 man 435, and 2532 full 4134 of the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 and 2532 of faith 4102: and 2532 much 2425 people 3793 was added 4369 5681 unto the Lord 2962. 

11:25 Then 1161 departed 1831 5627 Barnabas 921 to 1519 Tarsus 5019, for to seek 327 5658 Saul 4569: 

11:26 And 2532 when he had found 2147 5631 him 846, he brought 71 5627 him 846 unto 1519 Antioch 490. And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, that a whole 3650 year 1763 they assembled themselves 4863 5683 with 1722 the church 1577, and 2532 taught 1321 5658 much 2425 people 3793. And 5037 the disciples 3101 were called 5537 5658 Christians 5546 first 4412 in 1722 Antioch 490. 

11:27 And 1161 in 1722 these 5025 days 2250 came 2718 5627 prophets 4396 from 575 Jerusalem 2414 unto 1519 Antioch 490. 

11:28 And 1161 there stood up 450 5631 one 1520 of 1537 them 846 named 3686 Agabus 13, and signified 4591 5656 by 1223 the Spirit 4151 that there should be 3195 5721 1510 5705 great 3173 dearth 3042 throughout 1909 all 3650 the world 3625: which 3748 2532 came to pass 1096 5633 in the days of 1909 Claudius 2804 Caesar 2541. 

11:29 Then 1161 the disciples 3101, every 1538 man 846 according to 2531 his ability 2141 5711 5100, determined 3724 5656 to send 3992 5658 relief 1519 1248 unto the brethren 80 which dwelt 2730 5723 in 1722 Judaea 2449: 

11:30 Which 3739 also 2532 they did 4160 5656, and sent it 649 5660 to 4314 the elders 4245 by 1223 the hands 5495 of Barnabas 921 and 2532 Saul 4569. 

12:1 Now 1161 about 2596 that 1565 time 2540 Herod 2264 the king 935 stretched forth 1911 5627 [his] hands 5495 to vex 2559 5658 certain 5100 of 575 the church 1577. 

12:2 And 1161 he killed 337 5627 James 2385 the brother 80 of John 2491 with the sword 3162. 

12:3 And 2532 because he saw 1492 5631 it 3754 pleased 2076 5748 701 the Jews 2453, he proceeded further 4369 5639 to take 4815 5629 Peter 4074 also 2532. (Then 1161 were 2258 5713 the days 2250 of unleavened bread 106) 

12:4 And 2532 when he had apprehended 4084 5660 him, he put 5087 5639 [him] in 1519 prison 5438, and delivered 3860 5631 [him] to four 5064 quaternions 5069 of soldiers 4757 to keep 5442 5721 him 846; intending 1014 5740 after 3326 Easter 3957 to bring 321 0 him 846 forth 321 5629 to the people 2992. 

12:5 Peter 4074 3303 therefore 3767 was kept 5083 5712 in 1722 prison 5438: but 1161 prayer 4335 was 2258 5713 made 1096 5740 without ceasing 1618 of 5259 the church 1577 unto 4314 God 2316 for 5228 him 846. 

12:6 And 1161 when 3753 Herod 2264 would 3195 5707 have brought 4254 0 him 846 forth 4254 5721, the same 1565 night 3571 Peter 4074 was 2258 5713 sleeping 2837 5746 between 3342 two 1417 soldiers 4757, bound 1210 5772 with two 1417 chains 254: and 5037 the keepers 5441 before 4253 the door 2374 kept 5083 5707 the prison 5438. 

12:7 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, the angel 32 of the Lord 2962 came upon 2186 5627 [him], and 2532 a light 5457 shined 2989 5656 in 1722 the prison 3612: and 1161 he smote 3960 5660 Peter 4074 on the side 4125, and raised 1453 0 him 846 up 1453 5656, saying 3004 5723, Arise up 450 5628 quickly 1722 5034. And 2532 his 846 chains 254 fell off 1601 5627 from 1537 [his] hands 5495. 

12:8 And 5037 the angel 32 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Gird thyself 4024 5669, and 2532 bind on 5265 5669 thy 4675 sandals 4547. And 1161 so 3779 he did 4160 5656. And 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Cast 4016 0 thy garment 2440 about 4016 5640 thee 4675, and 2532 follow 190 5720 me 3427. 

12:9 And 2532 he went out 1831 5631, and followed 190 5707 him 846; and 2532 wist 1492 5715 not 3756 that 3754 it was 2076 5748 true 227 which 3588 was done 1096 5740 by 1223 the angel 32; but 1161 thought 1380 5707 he saw 991 5721 a vision 3705. 

12:10 When 1161 they were past 1330 5631 the first 4413 and 2532 the second 1208 ward 5438, they came 2064 5627 unto 1909 the iron 4603 gate 4439 that leadeth 5342 5723 unto 1519 the city 4172; which 3748 opened 455 5681 to them 846 of his own accord 844: and 2532 they went out 1831 5631, and passed on through 4281 5627 one 3391 street 4505; and 2532 forthwith 2112 the angel 32 departed 868 5627 from 575 him 846. 

12:11 And 2532 when Peter 4074 was come 1096 5637 to 1722 himself 1438, he said 2036 5627, Now 3568 I know 1492 5758 of a surety 230, that 3754 the Lord 2962 hath sent 1821 5656 his 848 angel 32, and 2532 hath delivered 1807 5639 me 3165 out of 1537 the hand 5495 of Herod 2264, and 2532 [from] all 3956 the expectation 4329 of the people 2992 of the Jews 2453. 

12:12 And 5037 when he had considered 4894 5631 [the thing], he came 2064 5627 to 1909 the house 3614 of Mary 3137 the mother 3384 of John 2491, whose surname was 1941 5746 Mark 3138; where 3757 many 2425 were 2258 5713 gathered together 4867 5772 praying 2532 4336 5740. 

12:13 And 1161 as Peter 4074 knocked at 2925 5660 the door 2374 of the gate 4440, a damsel 3814 came 4334 5627 to hearken 5219 5658, named 3686 Rhoda 4498. 

12:14 And 2532 when she knew 1921 5631 Peter's 4074 voice 5456, she opened 455 5656 not 3756 the gate 4440 for 575 gladness 5479, but 1161 ran in 1532 5631, and told how 518 5656 Peter 4074 stood 2476 5760 before 4253 the gate 4440. 

12:15 And 1161 they said 2036 5627 unto 4314 her 846, Thou art mad 3105 5736. But 1161 she constantly affirmed 1340 5711 that it was 2192 5721 even so 3779. Then 1161 said they 3004 5707, It is 2076 5748 his 846 angel 32. 

12:16 But 1161 Peter 4074 continued 1961 5707 knocking 2925 5723: and 1161 when they had opened 455 5660 [the door], and saw 1492 5627 him 846, 2532 they were astonished 1839 5627. 

12:17 But 1161 he, beckoning 2678 5660 unto them 846 with the hand 5495 to hold their peace 4601 5721, declared 1334 5662 unto them 846 how 4459 the Lord 2962 had brought 1806 5627 him 846 out of 1537 the prison 5438. And 1161 he said 2036 5627, Go shew 518 5657 these things 5023 unto James 2385, and 2532 to the brethren 80. And 2532 he departed 1831 5631, and went 4198 5675 into 1519 another 2087 place 5117. 

12:18 Now 1161 as soon as it was 1096 5637 day 2250, there was 2258 5713 no 3756 small 3641 stir 5017 among 1722 the soldiers 4757, what 5101 686 was become 1096 5633 of Peter 4074. 

12:19 And 1161 when 1934 0 Herod 2264 had sought for 1934 5660 him 846, and 2532 found him 2147 5631 not 3361, he examined 350 5660 the keepers 5441, and commanded 2753 5656 that [they] should be put to death 520 5683. And 2532 he went down 2718 5631 from 575 Judaea 2449 to 1519 Caesarea 2542, and [there] abode 1304 5707. 

12:20 And 1161 Herod 2264 was 2258 5713 highly displeased 2371 5723 with them of Tyre 5183 and 2532 Sidon 4606: but 1161 they came 3918 5713 with one accord 3661 to 4314 him 846, and 2532, having made 3982 0 Blastus 986 the king's 935 chamberlain 1909 2846 their friend 3982 5660, desired 154 5710 peace 1515; because 1223 their 846 country 5561 was nourished 5142 5745 by 575 the king's 937 [country]. 

12:21 And 1161 upon a set 5002 day 2250 Herod 2264, arrayed 1746 5671 in royal 937 apparel 2066, sat 2523 5660 upon 1909 his 846 throne 968, and 2532 made an oration 1215 5707 unto 4314 them 846. 

12:22 And 1161 the people 1218 gave a shout 2019 5707, [saying, It is] the voice 5456 of a god 2316, and 2532 not 3756 of a man 444. 

12:23 And 1161 immediately 3916 the angel 32 of the Lord 2962 smote 3960 5656 him 846, because 473 3739 he gave 1325 5656 not 3756 God 2316 the glory 1391: and 2532 he was 1096 5637 eaten of worms 4662, and gave up the ghost 1634 5656. 

12:24 But 1161 the word 3056 of God 2316 grew 837 5707 and 2532 multiplied 4129 5712. 

12:25 And 1161 Barnabas 921 and 2532 Saul 4569 returned 5290 5656 from 1537 Jerusalem 2419, when they had fulfilled 4137 5660 [their] ministry 1248, and 2532 took with them 4838 5631 John 2491, whose surname was 1941 5685 Mark 3138. 

13:1 Now 1161 there were 2258 5713 in 2596 the church 1577 that was 5607 5752 at 1722 Antioch 490 certain 5100 prophets 4396 and 2532 teachers 1320; as 3739 5037 Barnabas 921, and 2532 Simeon 4826 that was called 2564 5746 Niger 3526, and 2532 Lucius 3066 of Cyrene 2956, and 5037 Manaen 3127, which had been brought up 4939 with Herod 2264 the tetrarch 5076, and 2532 Saul 4569. 

13:2 As 1161 they ministered 3008 5723 to the Lord 2962, and 2532 fasted 3522 5723, the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 said 2036 5627, 1211 Separate 873 5657 me 3427 5037 Barnabas 921 and 2532 Saul 4569 for 1519 the work 2041 whereunto 3739 I have called 4341 5766 them 846. 

13:3 And 5119 when they had fasted 3522 5660 and 2532 prayed 4336 5666, and 2532 laid 2007 0 [their] hands 5495 on 2007 5631 them 846, they sent [them] away 630 5656. 

13:4 So 3303 3767 they 3778, being sent forth 1599 5685 by 5259 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, departed 2718 5627 unto 1519 Seleucia 4581; and from 1564 thence 5037 they sailed 636 5656 to 1519 Cyprus 2954. 

13:5 And 2532 when they were 1096 5637 at 1722 Salamis 4529, they preached 2605 5707 the word 3056 of God 2316 in 1722 the synagogues 4864 of the Jews 2453: and 1161 they had 2192 5707 also 2532 John 2491 to [their] minister 5257. 

13:6 And 1161 when they had gone through 1330 5631 the isle 3520 unto 891 Paphos 3974, they found 2147 5627 a certain 5100 sorcerer 3097, a false prophet 5578, a Jew 2453, whose 3739 name 3686 [was] Barjesus 919: 

13:7 Which 3739 was 2258 5713 with 4862 the deputy of the country 446, Sergius 4588 Paulus 3972, a prudent 4908 man 435; who 3778 called 4341 5666 for Barnabas 921 and 2532 Saul 4569, and desired 1934 5656 to hear 191 5658 the word 3056 of God 2316. 

13:8 But 1161 Elymas 1681 the sorcerer 3097 (for 1063 so 3779 is his 846 name 3686 by interpretation 3177 5743) withstood 436 5710 them 846, seeking 2212 5723 to turn away 1294 5658 the deputy 446 from 575 the faith 4102. 

13:9 Then 1161 Saul 4569, (who 3588 also 2532 [is called] Paul 3972) filled with 4130 5685 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, 2532 set his eyes 816 5660 on 1519 him 846, 

13:10 And said 2036 5627, O 5599 full 4134 of all 3956 subtilty 1388 and 2532 all 3956 mischief 4468, [thou] child 5207 of the devil 1228, [thou] enemy 2190 of all 3956 righteousness 1343, wilt thou 3973 0 not 3756 cease 3973 5695 to pervert 1294 5723 the right 2117 ways 3598 of the Lord 2962? 

13:11 And 2532 now 3568, behold 2400 5628, the hand 5495 of the Lord 2962 [is] upon 1909 thee 4571, and 2532 thou shalt be 2071 5704 blind 5185, not 3361 seeing 991 5723 the sun 2246 for 891 a season 2540. And 1161 immediately 3916 there fell 1968 5627 on 1909 him 846 a mist 887 and 2532 a darkness 4655; and 2532 he went about 4013 5723 seeking 2212 5707 some to lead him by the hand 5497. 

13:12 Then 5119 the deputy 446, when he saw 1492 5631 what was done 1096 5756, believed 4100 5656, being astonished 1605 5746 at 1909 the doctrine 1322 of the Lord 2962. 

13:13 Now 1161 when Paul 3972 and his company 4012 loosed 321 5685 from 575 Paphos 3974, they came 2064 5627 to 1519 Perga 4011 in Pamphylia 3828: and 1161 John 2491 departing 672 5660 from 575 them 846 returned 5290 5656 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414. 

13:14 But 1161 when they departed 1330 5631 from 575 Perga 4011, they came 3854 5633 to 1519 Antioch 490 in Pisidia 4099, and 2532 went 1525 5631 into 1519 the synagogue 4864 on the sabbath 4521 day 2250, and sat down 2523 5656. 

13:15 And 1161 after 3326 the reading 320 of the law 3551 and 2532 the prophets 4396 the rulers of the synagogue 752 sent 649 5656 unto 4314 them 846, saying 3004 5723, [Ye] men 435 [and] brethren 80, if 1487 ye have 2076 5748 1722 5213 any word 3056 of exhortation 3874 for 4314 the people 2992, say on 3004 5720. 

13:16 Then 1161 Paul 3972 stood up 450 5631, and 2532 beckoning 2678 5660 with [his] hand 5495 said 2036 5627, Men 435 of Israel 2475, and 2532 ye that fear 5399 5740 God 2316, give audience 191 5657. 

13:17 The God 2316 of this 5127 people 2992 of Israel 2474 chose 1586 5668 our 2257 fathers 3962, and 2532 exalted 5312 5656 the people 2992 when 1722 they dwelt as strangers 3940 in 1722 the land 1093 of Egypt 125, and 2532 with 3326 an high 5308 arm 1023 brought he 1806 5627 them 846 out of 1537 it 846. 

13:18 And 2532 about 5613 the time 5550 of forty years 5063 suffered he 5159 0 their 846 manners 5159 5656 in 1722 the wilderness 2048. 

13:19 And 2532 when he had destroyed 2507 5631 seven 2033 nations 1484 in 1722 the land 1093 of Chanaan 5477, he divided 2624 0 their 846 land 1093 to them 846 by lot 2624 5656. 

13:20 And 2532 after 3326 that 5023 he gave 1325 5656 [unto them] judges 2923 about 5613 the space of four hundred 5071 and 2532 fifty 4004 years 2094, until 2193 Samuel 4545 the prophet 4396. 

13:21 And afterward 2547 they desired 154 5668 a king 935: and 2532 God 2316 gave 1325 5656 unto them 846 Saul 4549 the son 5207 of Cis 2797, a man 435 of 1537 the tribe 5443 of Benjamin 958, by the space of forty 5062 years 2094. 

13:22 And 2532 when he had removed 3179 5660 him 846, he raised up 1453 5656 unto them 846 David 1138 to be 1519 their king 935; to whom 3739 also 2532 he gave testimony 3140 5660, and said 2036 5627, I have found 2147 5627 David 1138 the [son] of Jesse 2421, a man 435 after 2596 mine own 3450 heart 2588, which 3739 shall fulfil 4160 5692 all 3956 my 3450 will 2307. 

13:23 Of 575 this man's 5127 seed 4690 hath 1453 0 God 2316 according 2596 to [his] promise 1860 raised 1453 5656 unto Israel 2474 a Saviour 4990, Jesus 2424: 

13:24 When John 2491 had first preached 4296 5660 before 4253 his coming 4383 1529 the baptism 908 of repentance 3341 to all 3956 the people 2992 of Israel 2474. 

13:25 And 1161 as 5613 John 2491 fulfilled 4137 5707 his course 1408, he said 3004 5707, Whom 5101 think ye 5282 5719 that I 3165 am 1511 5750? I 1473 am 1510 5748 not 3756 [he]. But 235, behold 2400 5628, there cometh one 2064 5736 after 3326 me 1691, whose 3739 shoes 5266 of [his] feet 4228 I am 1510 5748 not 3756 worthy 514 to loose 3089 5658. 

13:26 Men 435 [and] brethren 80, children 5207 of the stock 1085 of Abraham 11, and 2532 whosoever among 1722 you 5213 feareth 5399 5740 God 2316, to you 5213 is 649 0 the word 3056 of this 5026 salvation 4991 sent 649 5648. 

13:27 For 1063 they that dwell 2730 5723 at 1722 Jerusalem 2419, and 2532 their 846 rulers 758, because they knew 50 0 him 5126 not 50 5660, nor yet 2532 the voices 5456 of the prophets 4396 which 3588 are read 314 5746 2596 every 3956 sabbath day 4521, they have fulfilled 4137 5656 [them] in condemning 2919 5660 [him]. 

13:28 And 2532 though they found 2147 5631 no 3367 cause 156 of death 2288 [in him], yet desired they 154 5668 Pilate 4091 that he 846 should be slain 337 5683. 

13:29 And 1161 when 5613 they had fulfilled 5055 5656 all 537 that was written 1125 5772 of 4012 him 846, they took [him] down 2507 5631 from 575 the tree 3586, and laid 5087 5656 [him] in 1519 a sepulchre 3419. 

13:30 But 1161 God 2316 raised 1453 5656 him 846 from 1537 the dead 3498: 

13:31 And he 3739 was seen 3700 5681 many 1909 4119 days 2250 of them which came up with 4872 5631 him 846 from 575 Galilee 1056 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419, who 3748 are 1526 5748 his 846 witnesses 3144 unto 4314 the people 2992. 

13:32 And 2532 we 2249 declare 2097 0 unto you 5209 glad tidings 2097 5731, how that 3754 the promise 1860 which was made 1096 5637 unto 4314 the fathers 3962, 

13:33 God 2316 hath fulfilled 1603 5758 the same 5026 unto us 2254 their 846 children 5043, in that he hath raised up 450 0 Jesus 2424 again 450 5660; as 5613 it is 1125 0 also 2532 written 1125 5769 in 1722 the second 1208 psalm 5568, Thou 4771 art 1488 5748 my 3450 Son 5207, this day 4594 have I 1473 begotten 1080 5758 thee 4571. 

13:34 And 1161 as concerning that 3754 he raised 450 0 him 846 up 450 5656 from 1537 the dead 3498, [now] no more 3371 to 3195 5723 return 5290 5721 to 1519 corruption 1312, he said 2046 5758 on this wise 3779, 3754 I will give 1325 5692 you 5213 the sure 4103 mercies 3741 of David 1138. 

13:35 Wherefore 1352 he saith 3004 5719 also 2532 in 1722 another 2087 [psalm], Thou shalt 1325 0 not 3756 suffer 1325 5692 thine 4675 Holy One 3741 to see 1492 5629 corruption 1312. 

13:36 For 1063 3303 David 1138, after he had served 5256 5660 his own 2398 generation 1074 by the will 1012 of God 2316, fell on sleep 2837 5681, and 2532 was laid 4369 5681 unto 4314 his 848 fathers 3962, and 2532 saw 1492 5627 corruption 1312: 

13:37 But 1161 he, whom 3739 God 2316 raised again 1453 5656, saw 1492 5627 no 3756 corruption 1312. 

13:38 Be it 2077 5749 known 1110 unto you 5213 therefore 3767, men 435 [and] brethren 80, that 3754 through 1223 this man 5127 is preached 2605 5743 unto you 5213 the forgiveness 859 of sins 266: 

13:39 And 2532 by 1722 him 5129 all 3956 that believe 4100 5723 are justified 1344 5743 from 575 all things 3956, from which 3739 ye could 1410 5675 not 3756 be justified 1344 5683 by 1722 the law 3551 of Moses 3475. 

13:40 Beware 991 5720 therefore 3767, lest that 3361 come 1904 5632 upon 1909 you 5209, which is spoken of 2046 5772 in 1722 the prophets 4396; 

13:41 Behold 1492 5628, ye despisers 2707, and 2532 wonder 2296 5657, and 2532 perish 853 5682: for 3754 I 1473 work 2038 5736 a work 2041 in 1722 your 5216 days 2250, a work 2041 which 3739 ye shall 4100 0 in no wise 3364 believe 4100 5661, though 1437 a man 5100 declare it 1555 5741 unto you 5213. 

13:42 And 1161 when the Jews 2453 were gone 1826 5654 out of 1537 the synagogue 4864, the Gentiles 1484 besought 3870 5707 that these 5023 words 4487 might be preached 2980 5683 to them 848 1519 the next 3342 sabbath 4521. 

13:43 Now 1161 when the congregation 4864 was broken up 3089 5685, many 4183 of the Jews 2453 and 2532 religious 4576 5740 proselytes 4339 followed 190 5656 Paul 3972 and 2532 Barnabas 921: who 3748, speaking 4354 5723 to them 846, persuaded 3982 5707 them 846 to continue 1961 5721 in the grace 5485 of God 2316. 

13:44 And 1161 the next 2064 5740 sabbath day 4521 came 4863 0 almost 4975 the whole 3956 city 4172 together 4863 5681 to hear 191 5658 the word 3056 of God 2316. 

13:45 But 1161 when the Jews 2453 saw 1492 5631 the multitudes 3793, they were filled 4130 5681 with envy 2205, and 2532 spake against 483 5707 those things which were spoken 3004 5746 by 5259 Paul 3972, contradicting 483 5723 and 2532 blaspheming 987 5723. 

13:46 Then 1161 Paul 3972 and 2532 Barnabas 921 waxed bold 3955 5666, and said 2036 5627, It was 2258 5713 necessary 316 that the word 3056 of God 2316 should 2980 0 first 4412 have been spoken 2980 5683 to you 5213: but 1161 seeing 1894 ye put 683 0 it 846 from you 683 5736, and 2532 judge 2919 5719 yourselves 1438 unworthy 3756 514 of everlasting 166 life 2222, lo 2400 5628, we turn 4762 5743 to 1519 the Gentiles 1484. 

13:47 For 1063 so 3779 hath 1781 0 the Lord 2962 commanded 1781 5769 us 2254, [saying], I have set 5087 5758 thee 4571 to be 1519 a light 5457 of the Gentiles 1484, that thou 4571 shouldest be 1511 5750 for 1519 salvation 4991 unto 2193 the ends 2078 of the earth 1093. 

13:48 And 1161 when the Gentiles 1484 heard this 191 5723, they were glad 5463 5707, and 2532 glorified 1392 5707 the word 3056 of the Lord 2962: and 2532 as many as 3745 were 2258 5713 ordained 5021 5772 to 1519 eternal 166 life 2222 believed 4100 5656. 

13:49 And 1161 the word 3056 of the Lord 2962 was published 1308 5712 throughout 1223 all 3650 the region 5561. 

13:50 But 1161 the Jews 2453 stirred up 3951 5656 the devout 4576 5740 and 2532 honourable 2158 women 1135, and 2532 the chief men 4413 of the city 4172, and 2532 raised 1892 5656 persecution 1375 against 1909 Paul 3972 and 2532 Barnabas 921, and 2532 expelled 1544 5627 them 846 out of 575 their 848 coasts 3725. 

13:51 But 1161 they shook off 1621 5671 the dust 2868 of their 848 feet 4228 against 1909 them 846, and came 2064 5627 unto 1519 Iconium 2430. 

13:52 And 1161 the disciples 3101 were filled with 4137 5712 joy 5479, and 2532 with the Holy 40 Ghost 4151. 

14:1 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633 in 1722 Iconium 2430, that they went 1525 5629 both 2596 together 846 into 1519 the synagogue 4864 of the Jews 2453, and 2532 so 3779 spake 2980 5658, that 5620 a great 4183 multitude 4128 both 5037 of the Jews 2453 and also 2532 of the Greeks 1672 believed 4100 5658. 

14:2 But 1161 the unbelieving 544 5723 Jews 2453 stirred up 1892 5656 the Gentiles 1484, and 2532 made 2559 0 their minds 5590 evil affected 2559 5656 against 2596 the brethren 80. 

14:3 Long 2425 time 5550 therefore 3303 3767 abode they 1304 5656 speaking boldly 3955 5740 in 1909 the Lord 2962, which 3588 gave testimony 3140 5723 unto the word 3056 of his 848 grace 5485, and 2532 granted 1325 5723 signs 4592 and 2532 wonders 5059 to be done 1096 5738 by 1223 their 846 hands 5495. 

14:4 But 1161 the multitude 4128 of the city 4172 was divided 4977 5681: and 2532 part 3303 held 2258 5713 with 4862 the Jews 2453, and 1161 part with 4862 the apostles 652. 

14:5 And 1161 when 5613 there was 1096 0 an assault 3730 made 1096 5633 both 5037 of the Gentiles 1484, and also 2532 of the Jews 2453 with 4862 their 846 rulers 758, to use [them] despitefully 5195 5658, and 2532 to stone 3036 5658 them 846, 

14:6 They were ware 4894 5631 of [it], and fled 2703 5627 unto 1519 Lystra 3082 and 2532 Derbe 1191, cities 4172 of Lycaonia 3071, and 2532 unto the region that lieth round about 4066: 

14:7 And there 2546 they preached the gospel 2258 5713 2097 5734. 

14:8 And 2532 there sat 2521 5711 a certain 5100 man 435 at 1722 Lystra 3082, impotent 102 in his feet 4228, being 5225 5723 a cripple 5560 from 1537 his 848 mother's 3384 womb 2836, who 3739 never 3763 had walked 4043 5715: 

14:9 The same 3778 heard 191 5707 Paul 3972 speak 2980 5723: who 3739 stedfastly beholding 816 5660 him 846, and 2532 perceiving 1492 5631 that 3754 he had 2192 5719 faith 4102 to be healed 4982 5683, 

14:10 Said 2036 5627 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, Stand 450 5628 upright 3717 on 1909 thy 4675 feet 4228. And 2532 he leaped 242 5711 and 2532 walked 4043 5707. 

14:11 And 1161 when the people 3793 saw 1492 5631 what 3739 Paul 3972 had done 4160 5656, they lifted up 1869 5656 their 848 voices 5456, saying 3004 5723 in the speech of Lycaonia 3072, The gods 2316 are come down 2597 5627 to 4314 us 2248 in the likeness 3666 5685 of men 444. 

14:12 And 5037 they called 2564 5707 Barnabas 921, 3303 Jupiter 2203; and 1161 Paul 3972, Mercurius 2060, because 1894 he 846 was 2258 5713 the chief 2233 5740 speaker 3056. 

14:13 Then 1161 the priest 2409 of Jupiter 2203, which 3588 was 5607 5752 before 4253 their 846 city 4172, brought 5342 5660 oxen 5022 and 2532 garlands 4725 unto 1909 the gates 4440, and would 2309 5707 have done sacrifice 2380 5721 with 4862 the people 3793. 

14:14 [Which] when 1161 the apostles 652, Barnabas 921 and 2532 Paul 3972, heard 191 5660 [of], they rent 1284 5660 their 848 clothes 2440, and ran 1530 5656 in among 1519 the people 3793, crying out 2896 5723, 

14:15 And 2532 saying 3004 5723, Sirs 435, why 5101 do ye 4160 5719 these things 5130? We 2249 also 2532 are 2070 5748 men 444 of like passions 3663 with you 5213, and preach 2097 5734 unto you 5209 that ye should turn 1994 5721 from 575 these 5023 vanities 3152 unto 1909 the living 2198 5723 God 2316, which 3739 made 4160 5656 heaven 3772, and 2532 earth 1093, and 2532 the sea 2281, and 2532 all things 3956 that are therein 1722 846: 

14:16 Who 3739 in 1722 times 1074 past 3944 5768 suffered 1439 5656 all 3956 nations 1484 to walk 4198 5738 in their own 848 ways 3598. 

14:17 Nevertheless 2544 2532 he left 863 5656 not 3756 himself 1438 without witness 267, in that he did good 15 5723, and gave 1325 5723 us 2254 rain 5205 from heaven 3771, and 2532 fruitful 2593 seasons 2540, filling 1705 5723 our 2257 hearts 2588 with food 5160 and 2532 gladness 2167. 

14:18 And 2532 with these 5023 sayings 3004 5723 scarce 3433 restrained they 2664 5656 the people 3793, that they had 2380 0 not 3361 done sacrifice 2380 5721 unto them 846. 

14:19 And 1161 there came thither 1904 5627 [certain] Jews 2453 from 575 Antioch 490 and 2532 Iconium 2430, who 2532 persuaded 3982 5660 the people 3793, and 2532, having stoned 3034 5660 Paul 3972, drew 4951 5707 [him] out of 1854 the city 4172, supposing 3543 5660 he 846 had been dead 2348 5755. 

14:20 Howbeit 1161, as the disciples 3101 stood round about 2944 5660 him 846, he rose up 450 5631, and came 1525 5627 into 1519 the city 4172: and 2532 the next day 1887 he departed 1831 5627 with 4862 Barnabas 921 to 1519 Derbe 1191. 

14:21 And 5037 when they had preached the gospel 2097 5671 to that 1565 city 4172, and 2532 had taught 3100 5660 many 2425, they returned again 5290 5656 to 1519 Lystra 3082, and 2532 [to] Iconium 2430, and 2532 Antioch 490, 

14:22 Confirming 1991 5723 the souls 5590 of the disciples 3101, [and] exhorting them 3870 5723 to continue 1696 5721 in the faith 4102, and 2532 that 3754 we 2248 must 1163 5748 through 1223 much 4183 tribulation 2347 enter 1525 5629 into 1519 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. 

14:23 And 1161 when they had ordained 5500 5660 them 846 elders 4245 in every 2596 church 1577, and had prayed 4336 5666 with 3326 fasting 3521, they commended 3908 5639 them 846 to the Lord 2962, on 1519 whom 3739 they believed 4100 5715. 

14:24 And 2532 after they had passed throughout 1330 5631 Pisidia 4099, they came 2064 5627 to 1519 Pamphylia 3828. 

14:25 And 2532 when they had preached 2980 5660 the word 3056 in 1722 Perga 4011, they went down 2597 5627 into 1519 Attalia 825: 

14:26 And thence 2547 sailed 636 5656 to 1519 Antioch 490, from whence 3606 they had been 2258 5713 recommended 3860 5772 to the grace 5485 of God 2316 for 1519 the work 2041 which 3739 they fulfilled 4137 5656. 

14:27 And 1161 when they were come 3854 5637, and 2532 had gathered 4863 0 the church 1577 together 4863 5631, they rehearsed 312 5656 all 3745 that God 2316 had done 4160 5656 with 3326 them 846, and 2532 how 3754 he had opened 455 5656 the door 2374 of faith 4102 unto the Gentiles 1484. 

14:28 And 1161 there 1563 they abode 1304 5707 long 3756 3641 time 5550 with 4862 the disciples 3101. 

15:1 And 2532 certain men 5100 which came down 2718 5631 from 575 Judaea 2449 taught 1321 5707 the brethren 80, [and said], 3754 Except 3362 ye be circumcised 4059 5747 after the manner 1485 of Moses 3475, ye cannot 3756 1410 5736 be saved 4982 5683. 

15:2 When therefore 3767 Paul 3972 and 2532 Barnabas 921 had 1096 5637 no 3756 small 3641 dissension 4714 and 2532 disputation 4803 with 4314 them 846, they determined 5021 5656 that Paul 3972 and 2532 Barnabas 921, and 2532 certain 5100 other 243 of 1537 them 846, should go up 305 5721 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419 unto 4314 the apostles 652 and 2532 elders 4245 about 4012 this 5127 question 2213. 

15:3 And 3303 3767 being brought on their way 4311 5685 by 5259 the church 1577, they passed through 1330 5711 Phenice 5403 and 2532 Samaria 4540, declaring 1555 5740 the conversion 1995 of the Gentiles 1484: and 2532 they caused 4160 5707 great 3173 joy 5479 unto all 3956 the brethren 80. 

15:4 And 1161 when they were come 3854 5637 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419, they were received 588 5681 of 5259 the church 1577, and 2532 [of] the apostles 652 and 2532 elders 4245, and 5037 they declared 312 5656 all things 3745 that God 2316 had done 4160 5656 with 3326 them 846. 

15:5 But 1161 there rose up 1817 5627 certain 5100 of 575 the sect 139 of the Pharisees 5330 which believed 4100 5761, saying 3004 5723, That 3754 it was needful 1163 5748 to circumcise 4059 5721 them 846, and 5037 to command 3853 5721 [them] to keep 5083 5721 the law 3551 of Moses 3475. 

15:6 And 1161 the apostles 652 and 2532 elders 4245 came together 4863 5681 for to consider 1492 5629 of 4012 this 5127 matter 3056. 

15:7 And 1161 when there had been 1096 5637 much 4183 disputing 4803, Peter 4074 rose up 450 5631, and said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Men 435 [and] brethren 80, ye 5210 know 1987 5736 how that 3754 a good 744 while 2250 ago 575 God 2316 made choice 1586 5668 among 1722 us 2254, that the Gentiles 1484 by 1223 my 3450 mouth 4750 should hear 191 5658 the word 3056 of the gospel 2098, and 2532 believe 4100 5658. 

15:8 And 2532 God 2316, which knoweth the hearts 2589, bare them witness 3140 5656, giving 1325 5631 them 846 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, even 2532 as 2531 [he did] unto us 2254; 

15:9 And 2532 put 1252 0 no 3762 difference 1252 5656 between 3342 5037 us 2257 and 2532 them 846, purifying 2511 5660 their 846 hearts 2588 by faith 4102. 

15:10 Now 3568 therefore 3767 why 5101 tempt ye 3985 5719 God 2316, to put 2007 5629 a yoke 2218 upon 1909 the neck 5137 of the disciples 3101, which 3739 neither 3777 our 2257 fathers 3962 nor 3777 we 2249 were able 2480 5656 to bear 941 5658? 

15:11 But 235 we believe 4100 5719 that through 1223 the grace 5485 of the Lord 2962 Jesus 2424 Christ 5547 we shall be saved 4982 5683, even 2596 3739 as 5158 they 2548. 

15:12 Then 1161 all 3956 the multitude 4128 kept silence 4601 5656, and 2532 gave audience 191 5707 to Barnabas 921 and 2532 Paul 3972, declaring 1834 5740 what 3745 miracles 4592 and 2532 wonders 5059 God 2316 had wrought 4160 5656 among 1722 the Gentiles 1484 by 1223 them 846. 

15:13 And 1161 after 3326 they had held 4601 0 their 846 peace 4601 5658, James 2385 answered 611 5662, saying 3004 5723, Men 435 [and] brethren 80, hearken 191 5657 unto me 3450: 

15:14 Simeon 4826 hath declared 1834 5662 how 2531 God 2316 at the first 4412 did visit 1980 5662 the Gentiles 1484, to take 2983 5629 out of 1537 them a people 2992 for 1909 his 848 name 3686. 

15:15 And 2532 to this 5129 agree 4856 5719 the words 3056 of the prophets 4396; as 2531 it is written 1125 5769, 

15:16 After 3326 this 5023 I will return 390 5692, and 2532 will build again 456 5692 the tabernacle 4633 of David 1138, which 3588 is fallen down 4098 5761; and 2532 I will build again 456 5692 the ruins 2679 5772 thereof 846, and 2532 I will set 461 0 it 846 up 461 5692: 

15:17 That 3704 302 the residue 2645 of men 444 might seek after 1567 5661 the Lord 2962, and 2532 all 3956 the Gentiles 1484, upon 1909 whom 3739 my 3450 name 3686 is called 1941 5769, saith 3004 5719 the Lord 2962, who 3588 doeth 4160 5723 all 3956 these things 5023. 

15:18 Known 1110 unto God 2316 are 2076 5748 all 3956 his 848 works 2041 from 575 the beginning of the world 165. 

15:19 Wherefore 1352 my 1473 sentence is 2919 5719, that we trouble 3926 5721 not 3361 them, which 3588 from among 575 the Gentiles 1484 are turned 1994 5723 to 1909 God 2316: 

15:20 But 235 that we write 1989 5658 unto them 846, that they abstain 567 5733 from 575 pollutions 234 of idols 1497, and 2532 [from] fornication 4202, and 2532 [from] things strangled 4156, and 2532 [from] blood 129. 

15:21 For 1063 Moses 3475 of 1537 old 744 time 1074 hath 2192 5719 in every 2596 city 4172 them that preach 2784 5723 him 846, being read 314 5746 in 1722 the synagogues 4864 every 2596 3956 sabbath day 4521. 

15:22 Then 5119 pleased it 1380 5656 the apostles 652 and 2532 elders 4245, with 4862 the whole 3650 church 1577, to send 3992 5658 chosen 1586 5671 men 435 of 1537 their own company 846 to 1519 Antioch 490 with 4862 Paul 3972 and 2532 Barnabas 921; [namely], Judas 2455 surnamed 1941 5746 Barsabas 923, and 2532 Silas 4609, chief 2233 5740 men 435 among 1722 the brethren 80: 

15:23 And they wrote 1125 5660 [letters] by 1223 them 5495 846 after this manner 3592; The apostles 652 and 2532 elders 4245 and 2532 brethren 80 [send] greeting 5463 5721 unto the brethren 80 which 3588 are of 1537 the Gentiles 1484 in 2596 Antioch 490 and 2532 Syria 4947 and 2532 Cilicia 2791: 

15:24 Forasmuch as 1894 we have heard 191 5656, that 3754 certain 5100 which went out 1831 5631 from 1537 us 2257 have troubled 5015 5656 you 5209 with words 3056, subverting 384 5723 your 5216 souls 5590, saying 3004 5723, [Ye must] be circumcised 4059 5745, and 2532 keep 5083 5721 the law 3551: to whom 3739 we gave 1291 0 no 3756 [such] commandment 1291 5668: 

15:25 It seemed good 1380 5656 unto us 2254, being assembled 1096 5637 with one accord 3661, to send 3992 5658 chosen 1586 5671 men 435 unto 4314 you 5209 with 4862 our 2257 beloved 27 Barnabas 921 and 2532 Paul 3972, 

15:26 Men 444 that have hazarded 3860 5761 their 848 lives 5590 for 5228 the name 3686 of our 2257 Lord 2962 Jesus 2424 Christ 5547. 

15:27 We have sent 649 5758 therefore 3767 Judas 2455 and 2532 Silas 4609, who 846 shall 518 0 also 2532 tell 518 5723 [you] the same things 846 by 1223 mouth 3056. 

15:28 For 1063 it seemed good 1380 5656 to the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, and 2532 to us 2254, to lay upon 2007 5733 you 5213 no 3367 greater 4119 burden 922 than 4133 these 5130 necessary things 1876; 

15:29 That ye abstain 567 5733 from meats offered to idols 1494, and 2532 from blood 129, and 2532 from things strangled 4156, and 2532 from fornication 4202: from 1537 which 3739 if ye keep 1301 5723 yourselves 1438, ye shall do 4238 5692 well 2095. Fare ye well 4517 5770. 

15:30 So 3303 3767 when they were dismissed 630 5685, they came 2064 5627 to 1519 Antioch 490: and 2532 when they had gathered 4863 0 the multitude 4128 together 4863 5631, they delivered 1929 5656 the epistle 1992: 

15:31 [Which] when 1161 they had read 314 5631, they rejoiced 5463 5644 for 1909 the consolation 3874. 

15:32 And Judas 2455 and 2532 Silas 4609, being 5607 5752 prophets 4396 also 2532 themselves 846, exhorted 3870 5656 the brethren 80 with 1223 many 4183 words 3056, and 2532 confirmed 1991 5656 [them]. 

15:33 And 1161 after they had tarried 4160 5660 [there] a space 5550, they were let go 630 5681 in 3326 peace 1515 from 575 the brethren 80 unto 4314 the apostles 652. 

15:34 Notwithstanding 1161 it pleased 1380 5656 Silas 4609 to abide 1961 0 there 847 still 1961 5658. 

15:35 Paul 3972 also 1161 and 2532 Barnabas 921 continued 1304 5707 in 1722 Antioch 490, teaching 1321 5723 and 2532 preaching 2097 5734 the word 3056 of the Lord 2962, with 3326 many 4183 others 2087 also 2532. 

15:36 And 1161 some 5100 days 2250 after 3326 Paul 3972 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 Barnabas 921, 1211 Let us go again 1994 5660 and visit 1980 5667 our 2257 brethren 80 in 2596 every 3956 city 4172 where 1722 3739 we have preached 2605 5656 the word 3056 of the Lord 2962, [and see] how 4459 they do 2192 5719. 

15:37 And 1161 Barnabas 921 determined 1011 5662 to take with them 4838 5629 John 2491, whose surname was 2564 5746 Mark 3138. 

15:38 But 1161 Paul 3972 thought 515 0 not 3361 good 515 5707 to take 4838 0 him 5126 with them 4838 5629, who 3588 departed from 868 5631 them 846 from 575 Pamphylia 3828, and 2532 went 4905 5631 not 3361 with them 846 to 1519 the work 2041. 

15:39 And 3767 the contention 3948 0 was 1096 5633 so sharp between them 3948, that 5620 they departed asunder 673 5683 one from the other 575 240: and so 5037 Barnabas 921 took 3880 5631 Mark 3138, and sailed 1602 5658 unto 1519 Cyprus 2954; 

15:40 And 1161 Paul 3972 chose 1951 5671 Silas 4609, and departed 1831 5627, being recommended 3860 5685 by 5259 the brethren 80 unto the grace 5485 of God 2316. 

15:41 And 1161 he went through 1330 5711 Syria 4947 and 2532 Cilicia 2791, confirming 1991 5723 the churches 1577. 

16:1 Then 1161 came he 2658 5656 to 1519 Derbe 1191 and 2532 Lystra 3082: and 2532, behold 2400 5628, a certain 5100 disciple 3101 was 2258 5713 there 1563, named 3686 Timotheus 5095, the son 5207 of a certain 5100 woman 1135, which was a Jewess 2453, and believed 4103; but 1161 his father 3962 [was] a Greek 1672: 

16:2 Which 3739 was well reported 3140 5712 of by 5259 the brethren 80 that were at 1722 Lystra 3082 and 2532 Iconium 2430. 

16:3 Him 5126 would 2309 5656 Paul 3972 have to go forth 1831 5629 with 4862 him 848; and 2532 took 2983 5631 and circumcised 4059 5627 him 846 because 1223 of the Jews 2453 which 3588 were 5607 5752 in 1722 those 1565 quarters 5117: for 1063 they knew 1492 5715 all 537 that 3754 his 846 father 3962 was 5225 5707 a Greek 1672. 

16:4 And 1161 as 5613 they went through 1279 5711 the cities 4172, they delivered 3860 5707 them 846 the decrees 1378 for to keep 5442 5721, that were ordained 2919 5772 of 5259 the apostles 652 and 2532 elders 4245 which 3588 were at 1722 Jerusalem 2419. 

16:5 And so 3303 3767 were 4732 0 the churches 1577 established 4732 5712 in the faith 4102, and 2532 increased 4052 5707 in number 706 daily 2250 2596. 

16:6 Now 1161 when they had gone throughout 1330 5631 Phrygia 5435 and 2532 the region 5561 of Galatia 1054, and were forbidden 2967 5685 of 5259 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 to preach 2980 5658 the word 3056 in 1722 Asia 773, 

16:7 After they were come 2064 5631 to 2596 Mysia 3465, they assayed 3985 5707 to go 4198 5738 into 2596 Bithynia 978: but 2532 the Spirit 4151 suffered 1439 5656 them 846 not 3756. 

16:8 And 1161 they passing by 3928 5631 Mysia 3465 came down 2597 5627 to 1519 Troas 5174. 

16:9 And 2532 a vision 3705 appeared 3700 5681 to Paul 3972 in 1223 the night 3571; There stood 2258 5713 2476 5761 a man 5100 435 of Macedonia 3110, and prayed 3870 5723 him 846, 2532 saying 3004 5723, Come over 1224 5631 into 1519 Macedonia 3109, and help 997 5657 us 2254. 

16:10 And 1161 after 5613 he had seen 1492 5627 the vision 3705, immediately 2112 we endeavoured 2212 5656 to go 1831 5629 into 1519 Macedonia 3109, assuredly gathering 4822 5723 that 3754 the Lord 2962 had called 4341 5766 us 2248 for to preach the gospel 2097 5670 unto them 846. 

16:11 Therefore 3767 loosing 321 5685 from 575 Troas 5174, we came with a straight course 2113 5656 to 1519 Samothracia 4543, and 5037 the next 1966 5752 [day] to 1519 Neapolis 3496; 

16:12 And 5037 from thence 1564 to 1519 Philippi 5375, which 3748 is 2076 5748 the chief 4413 city 4172 of that part 3310 of Macedonia 3109, [and] a colony 2862: and 1161 we were 2258 5713 in 1722 that 5026 city 4172 abiding 1304 5723 certain 5100 days 2250. 

16:13 And 5037 on the sabbath 4521 2250 we went 1831 5627 out of 1854 the city 4172 by 3844 a river side 4215, where 3757 prayer 4335 was wont 3543 5712 to be made 1511 5750; and 2532 we sat down 2523 5660, and spake 2980 5707 unto the women 1135 which resorted 4905 5631 [thither]. 

16:14 And 2532 a certain 5100 woman 1135 named 3686 Lydia 3070, a seller of purple 4211, of the city 4172 of Thyatira 2363, which worshipped 4576 5740 God 2316, heard 191 5707 [us]: whose 3739 heart 2588 the Lord 2962 opened 1272 5656, that she attended 4337 5721 unto the things which were spoken 2980 5746 of 5259 Paul 3972. 

16:15 And 1161 when 5613 she was baptized 907 5681, and 2532 her 846 household 3624, she besought 3870 5656 [us], saying 3004 5723, If 1487 ye have judged 2919 5758 me 3165 to be 1511 5750 faithful 4103 to the Lord 2962, come 1525 5631 into 1519 my 3450 house 3624, and abide 3306 5657 [there]. And 2532 she constrained 3849 5662 us 2248. 

16:16 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, as we 2257 went 4198 5740 to 1519 prayer 4335, a certain 5100 damsel 3814 possessed 2192 5723 with a spirit 4151 of divination 4436 met 528 5658 us 2254, which 3748 brought 3930 5707 her 848 masters 2962 much 4183 gain 2039 by soothsaying 3132 5740: 

16:17 The same 3778 followed 2628 5660 Paul 3972 and 2532 us 2254, and cried 2896 5707, saying 3004 5723, These 3778 men 444 are 1526 5748 the servants 1401 of the most high 5310 God 2316, which 3748 shew 2605 5719 unto us 2254 the way 3598 of salvation 4991. 

16:18 And 1161 this 5124 did she 4160 5707 1909 many 4183 days 2250. But 1161 Paul 3972, being grieved 1278 5666, turned 1994 5660 and 2532 said 2036 5627 to the spirit 4151, I command 3853 5719 thee 4671 in 1722 the name 3686 of Jesus 2424 Christ 5547 to come 1831 5629 out of 575 her 846. And 2532 he came out 1831 5627 the same 846 hour 5610. 

16:19 And 1161 when her 846 masters 2962 saw 1492 5631 that 3754 the hope 1680 of their 848 gains 2039 was gone 1831 5627, they caught 1949 5637 Paul 3972 and 2532 Silas 4609, and drew 1670 5656 [them] into 1519 the marketplace 58 unto 1909 the rulers 758, 

16:20 And 2532 brought 4317 5631 them 846 to the magistrates 4755, saying 2036 5627, These 3778 men 444, being 5225 5723 Jews 2453, do exceedingly trouble 1613 5719 our 2257 city 4172, 

16:21 And 2532 teach 2605 5719 customs 1485, which 3739 are 1832 0 not 3756 lawful 1832 5748 for us 2254 to receive 3858 5738, neither 3761 to observe 4160 5721, being 5607 5752 Romans 4514. 

16:22 And 2532 the multitude 3793 rose up together 4911 5627 against 2596 them 846: and 2532 the magistrates 4755 rent off 4048 5660 their 846 clothes 2440, and commanded 2753 5707 to beat 4463 5721 [them]. 

16:23 And 5037 when they had laid 2007 5631 many 4183 stripes 4127 upon them 846, they cast 906 5627 [them] into 1519 prison 5438, charging 3853 5660 the jailor 1200 to keep 5083 5721 them 846 safely 806: 

16:24 Who 3739, having received 2983 5761 such 5108 a charge 3852, thrust 906 5627 them 846 into 1519 the inner 2082 prison 5438, and 2532 made 805 0 their 846 feet 4228 fast 805 5662 in 1519 the stocks 3586. 

16:25 And 1161 at 2596 midnight 3317 Paul 3972 and 2532 Silas 4609 prayed 4336 5740, and sang praises 5214 5707 unto God 2316: and 1161 the prisoners 1198 heard 1874 5711 them 846. 

16:26 And 1161 suddenly 869 there was 1096 5633 a great 3173 earthquake 4578, so that 5620 the foundations 2310 of the prison 1201 were shaken 4531 5683: and 5037 immediately 3916 all 3956 the doors 2374 were opened 455 5681, and 2532 every one's 3956 bands 1199 were loosed 447 5681. 

16:27 And 1161 the keeper of the prison 1200 awaking 1096 5637 out of his sleep 1853, and 2532 seeing 1492 5631 the prison 5438 doors 2374 open 455 5772, he drew out 4685 5671 his sword 3162, and would 3195 5707 have killed 337 5721 himself 1438, supposing 3543 5723 that the prisoners 1198 had been fled 1628 5755. 

16:28 But 1161 Paul 3972 cried 5455 5656 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, saying 3004 5723, Do 4238 5661 thyself 4572 no 3367 harm 2556: for 1063 we are 2070 5748 all 537 here 1759. 

16:29 Then 1161 he called 154 5660 for a light 5457, and sprang in 1530 5656, and 2532 came 1096 5637 trembling 1790, and fell down before 4363 5627 Paul 3972 and 2532 Silas 4609, 

16:30 And 2532 brought 4254 5631 them 846 out 1854, and said 5346 5713, Sirs 2962, what 5101 must 1163 5748 I 3165 do 4160 5721 to 2443 be saved 4982 5686? 

16:31 And 1161 they said 2036 5627, Believe 4100 5657 on 1909 the Lord 2962 Jesus 2424 Christ 5547, and 2532 thou 4771 shalt be saved 4982 5701, and 2532 thy 4675 house 3624. 

16:32 And 2532 they spake 2980 5656 unto him 846 the word 3056 of the Lord 2962, and 2532 to all 3956 that were in 1722 his 846 house 3614. 

16:33 And 2532 he took 3880 5631 them 846 1722 the same 1565 hour 5610 of the night 3571, and washed 3068 5656 [their] stripes 575 4127; and 2532 was baptized 907 5681, he 846 and 2532 all 3956 his 846, straightway 3916. 

16:34 And 5037 when he had brought 321 5631 them 846 into 1519 his 848 house 3624, he set 3908 0 meat 5132 before them 3908 5656, and 2532 rejoiced 21 5662, believing 4100 5761 in God 2316 with all 3832 0 his 846 house 3832. 

16:35 And 1161 when it was 1096 5637 day 2250, the magistrates 4755 sent 649 5656 the serjeants 4465, saying 3004 5723, Let 630 0 those 1565 men 444 go 630 5657. 

16:36 And 1161 the keeper of the prison 1200 told 518 5656 this 5128 saying 3056 to 4314 Paul 3972, 3754 The magistrates 4755 have sent 649 5758 to 2443 let you go 630 5686: now 3568 therefore 3767 depart 1831 5631, and go 4198 5737 in 1722 peace 1515. 

16:37 But 1161 Paul 3972 said 5346 5713 unto 4314 them 846, They have beaten 1194 5660 us 2248 openly 1219 uncondemned 178, being 5225 5723 Romans 4514 444, and have cast 906 5627 [us] into 1519 prison 5438; and 2532 now 3568 do they thrust 1544 0 us 2248 out 1544 5719 privily 2977? nay 3756 verily 1063; but 235 let them come 2064 5631 themselves 846 and fetch 1806 0 us 2248 out 1806 5628. 

16:38 And 1161 the serjeants 4465 told 312 5656 these 5023 words 4487 unto the magistrates 4755: and 2532 they feared 5399 5675, when they heard 191 5660 that 3754 they were 1526 5748 Romans 4514. 

16:39 And 2532 they came 2064 5631 and besought 3870 5656 them 846, and 2532 brought [them] out 1806 5631, and desired 2065 5707 [them] to depart out 1831 5629 of the city 4172. 

16:40 And 1161 they went 1831 5631 out of 1537 the prison 5438, and entered 1525 5627 into 1519 [the house of] Lydia 3070: and 2532 when they had seen 1492 5631 the brethren 80, they comforted 3870 5656 them 846, and 2532 departed 1831 5627. 

17:1 Now 1161 when they had passed through 1353 5660 Amphipolis 295 and 2532 Apollonia 624, they came 2064 5627 to 1519 Thessalonica 2332, where 3699 was 2258 5713 a synagogue 4864 of the Jews 2453: 

17:2 And 1161 Paul 3972, as 2596 his manner was 1486 5756, went in 1525 5627 unto 4314 them 846, and 2532 1909 three 5140 sabbath 4521 days reasoned 1256 5711 with them 846 out of 575 the scriptures 1124, 

17:3 Opening 1272 5723 and 2532 alleging 3908 5734, that 3754 Christ 5547 must needs 1163 5713 have suffered 3958 5629, and 2532 risen again 450 5629 from 1537 the dead 3498; and 2532 that 3754 this 3778 Jesus 2424, whom 3739 I 1473 preach 2605 5719 unto you 5213, is 2076 5748 Christ 5547. 

17:4 And 2532 some 5100 of 1537 them 846 believed 3982 5681, and 2532 consorted 4345 5681 with Paul 3972 and 2532 Silas 4609; and 5037 of the devout 4576 5740 Greeks 1672 a great 4183 multitude 4128, and 5037 of the chief 4413 women 1135 not 3756 a few 3641. 

17:5 But 1161 the Jews 2453 which believed not 544 5723, moved with envy 2206 5660, 2532 took unto them 4355 5642 certain 5100 lewd 4190 fellows 435 of the baser sort 60, and 2532 gathered a company 3792 5660, and set all 2350 0 the city 4172 on an uproar 2350 5707, and 5037 assaulted 2186 5631 the house 3614 of Jason 2394, and sought 2212 5707 to bring 71 5629 them 846 out 1519 to the people 1218. 

17:6 And 1161 when they found 2147 5631 them 846 not 3361, they drew 4951 5707 Jason 2394 and 2532 certain 5100 brethren 80 unto 1909 the rulers of the city 4173, crying 994 5723, 3754 These 3778 that have turned 387 0 the world 3625 upside down 387 5660 are come 3918 5748 hither 1759 also 2532; 

17:7 Whom 3739 Jason 2394 hath received 5264 5766: and 2532 these 3778 all 3956 do 4238 5719 contrary 561 to the decrees 1378 of Caesar 2541, saying 3004 5723 that there is 1511 5750 another 2087 king 935, [one] Jesus 2424. 

17:8 And 1161 they troubled 5015 5656 the people 3793 and 2532 the rulers of the city 4173, when they heard 191 5723 these things 5023. 

17:9 And 2532 when they had taken 2983 5631 security 2425 of 3844 Jason 2394, and 2532 of the other 3062, they let 630 0 them 846 go 630 5656. 

17:10 And 1161 the brethren 80 immediately 2112 sent away 1599 5656 5037 Paul 3972 and 2532 Silas 4609 by 1223 night 3571 unto 1519 Berea 960: who 3748 coming 3854 5637 [thither] went 549 5713 into 1519 the synagogue 4864 of the Jews 2453. 

17:11 1161 These 3778 were 2258 5713 more noble 2104 than those in 1722 Thessalonica 2332, in that they 3748 received 1209 5662 the word 3056 with 3326 all 3956 readiness of mind 4288, and searched 350 5723 the scriptures 1124 daily 2250 2596, whether 1487 those things 5023 were 2192 5722 so 3779. 

17:12 Therefore 3767 3303 many 4183 of 1537 them 846 believed 4100 5656; also 2532 of honourable 2158 women 1135 which 3588 were Greeks 1674, and 2532 of men 435, not 3756 a few 3641. 

17:13 But 1161 when 5613 the Jews 2453 of 575 Thessalonica 2332 had knowledge 1097 5627 that 3754 2532 the word 3056 of God 2316 was preached 2605 5648 of 5259 Paul 3972 at 1722 Berea 960, they came 2064 5627 thither also 2546, and stirred up 4531 5723 the people 3793. 

17:14 And 1161 then 5119 immediately 2112 the brethren 80 sent away 1821 5656 Paul 3972 to go 4198 5738 as it were 5613 to 1909 the sea 2281: but 1161 5037 Silas 4609 and 2532 Timotheus 5095 abode 5278 0 there 1563 still 5278 5707. 

17:15 And 1161 they that conducted 2525 5723 Paul 3972 brought 71 5627 him 846 unto 2193 Athens 116: and 2532 receiving 2983 5631 a commandment 1785 unto 4314 Silas 4609 and 2532 Timotheus 5095 for to 2443 come 2064 5632 to 4314 him 846 with all speed 5613 5033, they departed 1826 5713. 

17:16 Now 1161 while Paul 3972 waited for 1551 5740 them 846 at 1722 Athens 116, his 846 spirit 4151 was stirred 3947 5712 in 1722 him 846, when he saw 2334 5723 the city 4172 wholly given 5607 5752 to idolatry 2712. 

17:17 Therefore 3767 3303 disputed he 1256 5711 in 1722 the synagogue 4864 with the Jews 2453, and 2532 with the devout persons 4576 5740, and 2532 in 1722 the market 58 daily 2596 3956 2250 with 4314 them that met with him 3909 5723. 

17:18 Then 1161 certain 5100 philosophers 5386 of the Epicureans 1946, and 2532 of the Stoicks 4770, encountered 4820 5707 him 846. And 2532 some 5100 said 3004 5707, What 5101 will 302 2309 5722 this 3778 babbler 4691 say 3004 5721? 1161 other some, He seemeth 1380 5719 to be 1511 5750 a setter forth 2604 of strange 3581 gods 1140: because 3754 he preached 2097 5710 unto them 846 Jesus 2424, and 2532 the resurrection 386. 

17:19 And 5037 they took 1949 5637 him 846, and brought him 71 5627 unto 1909 Areopagus 697, saying 3004 5723, May 1410 5736 we know 1097 5629 what 5101 this 3778 new 2537 doctrine 1322, whereof 5259 thou 4675 speakest 2980 5746, [is]? 

17:20 For 1063 thou bringest 1533 5719 certain 5100 strange things 3579 5723 to 1519 our 2257 ears 189: we would 1014 5736 know 1097 5629 therefore 3767 what 5101 these things 5023 mean 302 2309 5722 1511 5750. 

17:21 (For 1161 all 3956 the Athenians 117 and 2532 strangers 3581 which 3588 were there 1927 5723 spent their time 2119 5707 in 1519 nothing 3762 else 2087, but either 2228 to tell 3004 5721, or 2532 to hear 191 5721 some 5100 new thing 2537) 

17:22 Then 1161 Paul 3972 stood 2476 5685 in 1722 the midst 3319 of Mars' hill 697, and said 5346 5713, [Ye] men 435 of Athens 117, I perceive 2334 5719 that 5613 in 2596 all things 3956 ye 5209 are too superstitious 1174. 

17:23 For 1063 as I passed by 1330 5740, and 2532 beheld 333 5723 your 5216 devotions 4574, 2532 I found 2147 5627 an altar 1041 with this 1722 3739 inscription 1924 5718, TO THE UNKNOWN 57 GOD 2316. Whom 3739 therefore 3767 ye ignorantly 50 5723 worship 2151 5719, him 5126 declare 2605 5719 I 1473 unto you 5213. 

17:24 God 2316 that made 4160 5660 the world 2889 and 2532 all things 3956 therein 1722 846, seeing that he 3778 is 5225 5723 Lord 2962 of heaven 3772 and 2532 earth 1093, dwelleth 2730 5719 not 3756 in 1722 temples 3485 made with hands 5499; 

17:25 Neither 3761 is worshipped 2323 5743 with 5259 men's 444 hands 5495, as though he needed 4326 5740 any thing 5100, seeing he 846 giveth 1325 5723 to all 3956 life 2222, and 2532 breath 4157, and 2596 all things 3956; 

17:26 And 5037 hath made 4160 5656 of 1537 one 1520 blood 129 all 3956 nations 1484 of men 444 for to dwell 2730 5721 on 1909 all 3956 the face 4383 of the earth 1093, and hath determined 3724 5660 the times 2540 before appointed 4384 5772, and 2532 the bounds 3734 of their 846 habitation 2733; 

17:27 That they should seek 2212 5721 the Lord 2962, if 1487 haply 686 they might feel 5584 5659 after him 846, and 2532 find him 2147 5630, though 2544 he be 5225 5723 not 3756 far 3112 from 575 every 1538 one 1520 of us 2257: 

17:28 For 1063 in 1722 him 846 we live 2198 5719, and 2532 move 2795 5743, and 2532 have our being 2070 5748; as 5613 certain 5100 also 2532 of your 5209 own 2596 poets 4163 have said 2046 5758, For 1063 we are 2070 5748 also 2532 his 5120 offspring 1085. 

17:29 Forasmuch then 3767 as we are 5225 5723 the offspring 1085 of God 2316, we ought 3784 5719 not 3756 to think 3543 5721 that the Godhead 2304 is 1511 5750 like 3664 unto gold 5557, or 2228 silver 696, or 2228 stone 3037, graven 5480 by art 5078 and 2532 man's 444 device 1761. 

17:30 And 3303 3767 the times 5550 of this ignorance 52 God 2316 winked at 5237 5660; but now 3569 commandeth 3853 5719 all 3956 men 444 every where 3837 to repent 3340 5721: 

17:31 Because 1360 he hath appointed 2476 5656 a day 2250, in 1722 the which 3739 he will 3195 5719 judge 2919 5721 the world 3625 in 1722 righteousness 1343 by 1722 [that] man 435 whom 3739 he hath ordained 3724 5656; [whereof] he hath given 3930 5631 assurance 4102 unto all 3956 [men], in that he hath raised 450 5660 him 846 from 1537 the dead 3498. 

17:32 And 1161 when they heard 191 5660 of the resurrection 386 of the dead 3498, some 3303 mocked 5512 5707: and 1161 others said 2036 5627, We will hear 191 5695 thee 4675 again 3825 of 4012 this 5127 [matter]. 

17:33 So 2532 3779 Paul 3972 departed 1831 5627 from 1537 among 3319 them 846. 

17:34 Howbeit 1161 certain 5100 men 435 clave 2853 5685 unto him 846, and believed 4100 5656: among 1722 the which 3739 2532 [was] Dionysius 1354 the Areopagite 698, and 2532 a woman 1135 named 3686 Damaris 1152, and 2532 others 2087 with 4862 them 846. 

18:1 1161 After 3326 these things 5023 Paul 3972 departed 5563 5685 from 1537 Athens 116, and came 2064 5627 to 1519 Corinth 2882; 

18:2 And 2532 found 2147 5631 a certain 5100 Jew 2453 named 3686 Aquila 207, born 1085 in Pontus 4193, lately 4373 come 2064 5756 from 575 Italy 2482, with 2532 his 846 wife 1135 Priscilla 4252; (because that 1223 Claudius 2804 had commanded 1299 5760 all 3956 Jews 2453 to depart 5563 5745 from 1537 Rome 4516) and came 4334 5627 unto them 846. 

18:3 And 2532 because 1223 he was 1511 5750 of the same craft 3673, he abode 3306 5707 with 3844 them 846, and 2532 wrought 2038 5711: for 1063 by their occupation 5078 they were 2258 5713 tentmakers 4635. 

18:4 And 1161 he reasoned 1256 5711 in 1722 the synagogue 4864 2596 every 3956 sabbath 4521, and 5037 persuaded 3982 5707 the Jews 2453 and 2532 the Greeks 1672. 

18:5 And 1161 when 5613 5037 Silas 4609 and 2532 Timotheus 5095 were come 2718 5627 from 575 Macedonia 3109, Paul 3972 was pressed 4912 5712 in the spirit 4151, and testified 1263 5740 to the Jews 2453 [that] Jesus 2424 [was] Christ 5547. 

18:6 And 1161 when they opposed 498 5734 themselves 846, and 2532 blasphemed 987 5723, he shook 1621 5671 [his] raiment 2440, and said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Your 5216 blood 129 [be] upon 1909 your 5216 own heads 2776; I 1473 [am] clean 2513: from 575 henceforth 3568 I will go 4198 5695 unto 1519 the Gentiles 1484. 

18:7 And 2532 he departed 3327 5631 thence 1564, and entered 2064 5627 into 1519 a certain 5100 [man's] house 3614, named 3686 Justus 2459, [one] that worshipped 4576 5740 God 2316, whose 3739 house 3614 joined hard 4927 5723 2258 5713 to the synagogue 4864. 

18:8 And 1161 Crispus 2921, the chief ruler of the synagogue 752, believed 4100 5656 on the Lord 2962 with 4862 all 3650 his 848 house 3624; and 2532 many 4183 of the Corinthians 2881 hearing 191 5723 believed 4100 5707, and 2532 were baptized 907 5712. 

18:9 Then 1161 spake 2036 5627 the Lord 2962 to Paul 3972 in 1223 the night 3571 by 1722 a vision 3705, Be 5399 0 not 3361 afraid 5399 5732 5737, but 235 speak 2980 5720, and 2532 hold 4623 0 not 3361 thy peace 4623 5661: 

18:10 For 1360 I 1473 am 1510 5748 with 3326 thee 4675, and 2532 no man 3762 shall set on 2007 5698 thee 4671 to hurt 2559 5658 thee 4571: for 1360 I 3427 have 2076 5748 much 4183 people 2992 in 1722 this 5026 city 4172. 

18:11 And 5037 he continued 2523 5656 [there] a year 1763 and 2532 six 1803 months 3376, teaching 1321 5723 the word 3056 of God 2316 among 1722 them 846. 

18:12 And 1161 when Gallio 1058 was the deputy 445 5723 of Achaia 882, the Jews 2453 made insurrection 2721 5627 with one accord against 3661 Paul 3972, and 2532 brought 71 5627 him 846 to 1909 the judgment seat 968, 

18:13 Saying 3004 5723, 3754 This 3778 [fellow] persuadeth 374 5719 men 444 to worship 4576 5738 God 2316 contrary 3844 to the law 3551. 

18:14 And 1161 when Paul 3972 was now about 3195 5723 to open 455 5721 [his] mouth 4750, Gallio 1058 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 the Jews 2453, If 1487 3303 3767 it were 2258 5713 a 5100 matter of wrong 92 or 2228 wicked 4190 lewdness 4467, O 5599 [ye] Jews 2453, reason 2596 3056 would 302 that I should bear 430 5633 with you 5216: 

18:15 But 1161 if 1487 it be 2076 5748 a question 2213 of 4012 words 3056 and 2532 names 3686, and 2532 [of] 2596 your 5209 law 3551, look ye 3700 5695 [to it]; for 1063 I 1473 will be 1014 5736 1511 5750 no 3756 judge 2923 of such 5130 [matters]. 

18:16 And 2532 he drave 556 5656 them 846 from 575 the judgment seat 968. 

18:17 Then 1161 all 3956 the Greeks 1672 took 1949 5637 Sosthenes 4988, the chief ruler of the synagogue 752, and beat 5180 5707 [him] before 1715 the judgment seat 968. And 2532 Gallio 1058 cared 3199 5707 for none 3762 of those things 5130. 

18:18 And 1161 Paul 3972 [after this] tarried 4357 5660 [there] yet 2089 a good 2425 while 2250, and then took his leave 657 5671 of the brethren 80, and sailed thence 1602 5707 into 1519 Syria 4947, and 2532 with 4862 him 846 Priscilla 4252 and 2532 Aquila 207; having shorn 2751 5671 [his] head 2776 in 1722 Cenchrea 2747: for 1063 he had 2192 5707 a vow 2171. 

18:19 And 1161 he came 2658 5656 to 1519 Ephesus 2181, and 2548 left 2641 5627 them there 847: but 1161 he himself 846 entered 1525 5631 into 1519 the synagogue 4864, and reasoned with 1256 5675 the Jews 2453. 

18:20 When 1161 they desired 2065 5723 [him] to tarry 3306 5658 longer 1909 4119 time 5550 with 3844 them 846, he consented 1962 5656 not 3756; 

18:21 But 235 bade 657 0 them 846 farewell 657 5662, saying 2036 5631, I 3165 must 1163 5748 by all means 3843 keep 4160 5658 this feast 1859 that cometh 2064 5740 in 1519 Jerusalem 2414: but 1161 I will return 344 5692 again 3825 unto 4314 you 5209, if God 2316 will 2309 5723. And 2532 he sailed 321 5681 from 575 Ephesus 2181. 

18:22 And 2532 when he had landed 2718 5631 at 1519 Caesarea 2542, and gone up 305 5631, and 2532 saluted 782 5666 the church 1577, he went down 2597 5627 to 1519 Antioch 490. 

18:23 And 2532 after he had spent 4160 5660 some 5100 time 5550 [there], he departed 1831 5627, and went over 1330 5740 [all] the country 5561 of Galatia 1054 and 2532 Phrygia 5435 in order 2517, strengthening 1991 5723 all 3956 the disciples 3101. 

18:24 And 1161 a certain 5100 Jew 2453 named 3686 Apollos 625, born 1085 at Alexandria 221, an eloquent 3052 man 435, [and] mighty 5607 5752 1415 in 1722 the scriptures 1124, came 2658 5656 to 1519 Ephesus 2181. 

18:25 This man 3778 was 2258 5713 instructed in 2727 5772 the way 3598 of the Lord 2962; and 2532 being fervent 2204 5723 in the spirit 4151, he spake 2980 5707 and 2532 taught 1321 5707 diligently 199 the things of 4012 the Lord 2962, knowing 1987 5740 only 3440 the baptism 908 of John 2491. 

18:26 And 5037 he 3778 began 756 5662 to speak boldly 3955 5738 in 1722 the synagogue 4864: whom 846 when 1161 Aquila 207 and 2532 Priscilla 4252 had heard 191 5660, they took 4355 5639 him 846 unto [them], and 2532 expounded 1620 5639 unto him 846 the way 3598 of God 2316 more perfectly 197. 

18:27 And 1161 when he 846 was disposed 1014 5740 to pass 1330 5629 into 1519 Achaia 882, the brethren 80 wrote 1125 5656, exhorting 4389 5671 the disciples 3101 to receive 588 5664 him 846: who 3739, when he was come 3854 5637, helped them 4820 5639 much 4183 which had believed 4100 5761 through 1223 grace 5485: 

18:28 For 1063 he mightily 2159 convinced 1246 5711 the Jews 2453, [and that] publickly 1219, shewing 1925 5723 by 1223 the scriptures 1124 that Jesus 2424 was 1511 5750 Christ 5547. 

19:1 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, that, while Apollos 625 was 1511 5750 1722 at 1722 Corinth 2882, Paul 3972 having passed 1330 5631 through the upper 510 coasts 3313 came 2064 5629 to 1519 Ephesus 2181: and 2532 finding 2147 5631 certain 5100 disciples 3101, 

19:2 He said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, 1487 Have ye received 2983 5627 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 since ye believed 4100 5660? And 1161 they said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, 235 We have 191 0 not so much as 3761 heard 191 5656 whether 1487 there be any 2076 5748 Holy 40 Ghost 4151. 

19:3 And 5037 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Unto 1519 what 5101 then 3767 were ye baptized 907 5681? And 1161 they said 2036 5627, Unto 1519 John's 2491 baptism 908. 

19:4 Then 1161 said 2036 5627 Paul 3972, John 2491 verily 3303 baptized 907 5656 with the baptism 908 of repentance 3341, saying 3004 5723 unto the people 2992, that 2443 they should believe 4100 5661 on 1519 him which should come 2064 5740 after 3326 him 846, that 5123 5748 is, on 1519 Christ 5547 Jesus 2424. 

19:5 When 1161 they heard 191 5660 [this], they were baptized 907 5681 in 1519 the name 3686 of the Lord 2962 Jesus 2424. 

19:6 And 2532 when Paul 3972 had laid 2007 0 [his] hands 5495 upon 2007 5631 them 846, the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 came 2064 5627 on 1909 them 846; and 5037 they spake 2980 5707 with tongues 1100, and 2532 prophesied 4395 5707. 

19:7 And 1161 all 3956 the men 435 were 2258 5713 about 5616 twelve 1177. 

19:8 And 1161 he went 1525 5631 into 1519 the synagogue 4864, and spake boldly 3955 5711 for the space 1909 of three 5140 months 3376, disputing 1256 5740 and 2532 persuading 3982 5723 the things concerning 4012 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. 

19:9 But 1161 when 5613 divers 5100 were hardened 4645 5712, and 2532 believed not 544 5707, but spake evil 2551 5723 of that way 3598 before 1799 the multitude 4128, he departed 868 5631 from 575 them 846, and separated 873 5656 the disciples 3101, disputing 1256 5740 daily 2596 2250 in 1722 the school 4981 of one 5100 Tyrannus 5181. 

19:10 And 1161 this 5124 continued 1096 5633 by the space 1909 of two 1417 years 2094; so 5620 that all 3956 they which dwelt in 2730 5723 Asia 773 heard 191 5658 the word 3056 of the Lord 2962 Jesus 2424, both 5037 Jews 2453 and 2532 Greeks 1672. 

19:11 And 5037 God 2316 wrought 4160 5707 special 3756 5177 5631 miracles 1411 by 1223 the hands 5495 of Paul 3972: 

19:12 So 2532 5620 that from 575 his 846 body 5559 were brought 2018 5745 unto 1909 the sick 770 5723 handkerchiefs 4676 or 2228 aprons 4612, and 2532 the diseases 3554 departed 525 5745 from 575 them 846, and 5037 the evil 4190 spirits 4151 went 1831 5738 out of 575 them 846. 

19:13 Then 1161 certain 5100 of 575 the vagabond 4022 5740 Jews 2453, exorcists 1845, took upon them 2021 5656 to call 3687 5721 over 1909 them which had 2192 5723 evil 4190 spirits 4151 the name 3686 of the Lord 2962 Jesus 2424, saying 3004 5723, We adjure 3726 5719 you 5209 by Jesus 2424 whom 3739 Paul 3972 preacheth 2784 5719. 

19:14 And 1161 there were 2258 5713 seven 2033 sons 5207 of [one] Sceva 4630 5100, a Jew 2453, [and] chief of the priests 749, which did 4160 5723 so 5124. 

19:15 And 1161 the evil 4190 spirit 4151 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, Jesus 2424 I know 1097 5719, and 2532 Paul 3972 I know 1987 5736; but 1161 who 5101 are 2075 5748 ye 5210? 

19:16 And 2532 the man 444 in 1722 whom 3739 the evil 4190 spirit 4151 was 2258 5713 leaped 2177 5740 on 1909 them 846, and 2532 overcame 2634 5660 them 846, and prevailed 2480 5656 against 2596 them 846, so 5620 that they fled 1628 5629 out of 1537 that 1565 house 3624 naked 1131 and 2532 wounded 5135 5772. 

19:17 And 1161 this 5124 was 1096 5633 known 1110 to all 3956 the Jews 2453 and 5037 Greeks 1672 also 2532 dwelling 2730 5723 at Ephesus 2181; and 2532 fear 5401 fell 1968 5627 on 1909 them 846 all 3956, and 2532 the name 3686 of the Lord 2962 Jesus 2424 was magnified 3170 5712. 

19:18 And 5037 many 4183 that believed 4100 5761 came 2064 5711, and confessed 1843 5734, and 2532 shewed 312 5723 their 848 deeds 4234. 

19:19 Many 2425 of them 846 also 1161 which used 4238 5660 curious arts 4021 brought 4851 0 their books 976 together 4851 5631, and burned them 2618 5707 before 1799 all 3956 [men]: and 2532 they counted 4860 5656 the price 5092 of them 846, and 2532 found 2147 5627 [it] fifty 4002 thousand 3461 [pieces] of silver 694. 

19:20 So 3779 mightily 2596 2904 grew 837 5707 the word 3056 of God 2962 and 2532 prevailed 2480 5707. 

19:21 After 1161 5613 these things 5023 were ended 4137 5681, Paul 3972 purposed 5087 5639 in 1722 the spirit 4151, when he had passed through 1330 5631 Macedonia 3109 and 2532 Achaia 882, to go 4198 5738 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419, saying 2036 5631, After 3754 3326 I 3165 have been 1096 5635 there 1563, I 3165 must 1163 5748 also 2532 see 1492 5629 Rome 4516. 

19:22 So 1161 he sent 649 5660 into 1519 Macedonia 3109 two 1417 of them that ministered 1247 5723 unto him 846, Timotheus 5095 and 2532 Erastus 2037; but he himself 846 stayed 1907 5627 in 1519 Asia 773 for a season 5550. 

19:23 And 1161 2596 the same 1565 time 2540 there arose 1096 5633 no 3756 small 3641 stir 5017 about 4012 that way 3598. 

19:24 For 1063 a certain 5100 [man] named 3686 Demetrius 1216, a silversmith 695, which made 4160 5723 silver 693 shrines 3485 for Diana 735, brought 3930 5710 no 3756 small 3641 gain 2039 unto the craftsmen 5079; 

19:25 Whom 3739 he called together 4867 5660 with the workmen 2040 of 4012 like occupation 5108, and 2532 said 2036 5627, Sirs 435, ye know 1987 5736 that 3754 by 1537 this 5026 craft 2039 we have 2076 5748 our 2257 wealth 2142. 

19:26 Moreover 2532 ye see 2334 5719 and 2532 hear 191 5719, that 3754 not 3756 alone 3440 at Ephesus 2181, but 235 almost 4975 throughout all 3956 Asia 773, this 3778 Paul 3972 hath persuaded 3982 5660 and turned away 3179 5656 much 2425 people 3793, saying 3004 5723 that 3754 they be 1526 5748 no 3756 gods 2316, which 3588 are made 1096 5740 with 1223 hands 5495: 

19:27 So 1161 that not 3756 only 3440 this 5124 our 2254 craft 3313 is in danger 2793 5719 to be set 2064 5629 at 1519 nought 557; but 235 also 2532 that the temple 2411 of the great 3173 goddess 2299 Diana 735 should be despised 1519 3762 3049 5683, and 1161 2532 her 846 magnificence 3168 should 3195 5721 be destroyed 2507 5745, whom 3739 all 3650 Asia 773 and 2532 the world 3625 worshippeth 4576 5736. 

19:28 And 1161 when they heard 191 5660 [these sayings], they were 1096 5637 full 4134 of wrath 2372, and 2532 cried out 2896 5707, saying 3004 5723, Great 3173 [is] Diana 735 of the Ephesians 2180. 

19:29 And 2532 the whole 3650 city 4172 was filled 4130 5681 with confusion 4799: and 5037 having caught 4884 5660 Gaius 1050 and 2532 Aristarchus 708, men of Macedonia 3110, Paul's 3972 companions in travel 4898, they rushed 3729 5656 with one accord 3661 into 1519 the theatre 2302. 

19:30 And 1161 when 1014 0 Paul 3972 would 1014 5740 have entered 1525 5629 in 1519 unto the people 1218, the disciples 3101 suffered 1439 5707 him 846 not 3756. 

19:31 And 1161 2532 certain 5100 of the chief of Asia 775, which were 5607 5752 his 846 friends 5384, sent 3992 5660 unto 4314 him 846, desiring 3870 5707 [him] that he would 1325 0 not 3361 adventure 1325 5629 himself 1438 into 1519 the theatre 2302. 

19:32 Some 243 therefore 3767 3303 cried 2896 5707 one thing 5100, and some another 243: for 1063 the assembly 1577 was 2258 5713 confused 4797 5772; and 2532 the more part 4119 knew 1492 5715 not 3756 wherefore 5101 1752 they were come together 4905 5715. 

19:33 And 1161 they drew 4264 5656 Alexander 223 out of 1537 the multitude 3793, the Jews 2453 putting 4261 0 him 846 forward 4261 5660 5625 4261 5723. And 1161 Alexander 223 beckoned 2678 5660 with the hand 5495, and would 2309 5707 have made his defence 626 5738 unto the people 1218. 

19:34 But 1161 when they knew 1921 5631 that 3754 he was 2076 5748 a Jew 2453, all 3956 1096 5633 with 1537 one 3391 voice 5456 about 5613 the space 1909 of two 1417 hours 5610 cried out 2896 5723, Great 3173 [is] Diana 735 of the Ephesians 2180. 

19:35 And 1161 when the townclerk 1122 had appeased 2687 5660 the people 3793, he said 5346 5748, [Ye] men 435 of Ephesus 2180, what 5101 1063 man 444 is there 2076 5748 that 3739 knoweth 1097 5719 not 3756 how that the city 4172 of the Ephesians 2180 is 5607 5752 a worshipper 3511 of the great 3173 goddess 2299 Diana 735, and 2532 of the [image] which fell down from Jupiter 1356? 

19:36 Seeing 5607 5752 then 3767 that these things 5130 cannot be spoken against 368, ye 5209 ought 1163 5752 2076 5748 to be 5225 5721 quiet 2687 5772, and 2532 to do 4238 5721 nothing 3367 rashly 4312. 

19:37 For 1063 ye have brought hither 71 5627 these 5128 men 435, which are neither 3777 robbers of churches 2417, nor yet 3777 blasphemers 987 5723 of your 5216 goddess 2299. 

19:38 Wherefore 3303 3767 if 1487 Demetrius 1216, and 2532 the craftsmen 5079 which are with 4862 him 846, have 2192 5719 a matter 3056 against 4314 any man 5100, the law 60 is open 71 5743, and 2532 there are 1526 5748 deputies 446: let them implead 1458 5720 one another 240. 

19:39 But 1161 if 1487 ye enquire 1934 5719 any thing 5100 concerning 4012 other matters 2087, it shall be determined 1956 5701 in 1722 a lawful 1772 assembly 1577. 

19:40 For 1063 2532 we are in danger 2793 5719 to be called in question 1458 5745 for 4012 this day's 4594 uproar 4714, there being 5225 5723 no 3367 cause 158 whereby 4012 3739 we may 1410 5695 give 591 5629 an account 3056 of this 5026 concourse 4963. 

19:41 And 2532 when he had 2036 0 thus 5023 spoken 2036 5631, he dismissed 630 5656 the assembly 1577. 

20:1 And 1161 after 3326 the uproar 2351 was ceased 3973 5670, Paul 3972 called 4341 5666 unto [him] the disciples 3101, and 2532 embraced 782 5666 [them], and departed 1831 5627 for to go 4198 5677 into 1519 Macedonia 3109. 

20:2 And 1161 when he had gone over 1330 5631 those 1565 parts 3313, and 2532 had given 4183 0 them 846 much 4183 exhortation 3870 5660 3056, he came 2064 5627 into 1519 Greece 1671, 

20:3 And 5037 [there] abode 4160 5660 three 5140 months 3376. And when the Jews 5259 2453 laid 1096 5637 wait 1917 for him 846, as he was about 3195 5723 to sail 321 5745 into 1519 Syria 4947, he purposed 1096 5633 1106 to return 5290 5721 through 1223 Macedonia 3109. 

20:4 And 1161 there accompanied 4902 5711 him 846 into 891 Asia 773 Sopater 4986 of Berea 961; and 1161 of the Thessalonians 2331, Aristarchus 708 and 2532 Secundus 4580; and 2532 Gaius 1050 of Derbe 1190, and 2532 Timotheus 5095; and 1161 of Asia 774, Tychicus 5190 and 2532 Trophimus 5161. 

20:5 These 3778 going before 4281 5631 tarried 3306 5707 for us 2248 at 1722 Troas 5174. 

20:6 And 1161 we 2249 sailed away 1602 5656 from 575 Philippi 5375 after 3326 the days 2250 of unleavened bread 106, and 2532 came 2064 5627 unto 4314 them 846 to 1519 Troas 5174 in 891 five 4002 days 2250; where 3757 we abode 1304 5656 seven 2033 days 2250. 

20:7 And 1161 upon 1722 the first 3391 [day] of the week 4521, when the disciples 3101 came together 4863 5772 to break 2806 5658 bread 740, Paul 3972 preached 1256 5711 unto them 846, ready 3195 5723 to depart 1826 5750 on the morrow 1887; and 5037 continued 3905 5707 his speech 3056 until 3360 midnight 3317. 

20:8 And 1161 there were 2258 5713 many 2425 lights 2985 in 1722 the upper chamber 5253, where 3757 they were 2258 5713 gathered together 4863 5772. 

20:9 And 1161 there sat 2521 5740 in 1909 a window 2376 a certain 5100 young man 3494 named 3686 Eutychus 2161, being fallen 2702 5746 into a deep 901 sleep 5258: and as Paul 3972 was long 1909 4119 preaching 1256 5740, he sunk down 2702 5685 with 575 sleep 5258, and fell down 2736 4098 5627 from 575 the third loft 5152, and 2532 was taken up 142 5681 dead 3498. 

20:10 And 1161 Paul 3972 went down 2597 5631, and fell on 1968 5627 him 846, and 2532 embracing 4843 5631 [him] said 2036 5627, Trouble 2350 0 not 3361 yourselves 2350 5744; for 1063 his 846 life 5590 is 2076 5748 in 1722 him 846. 

20:11 When 1161 he 305 0 therefore was come up again 305 5631, and 2532 had broken 2806 5660 bread 740, and 2532 eaten 1089 5666, and 5037 talked 3656 5660 1909 a long while 2425, even till 891 break of day 827, so 3779 he departed 1831 5627. 

20:12 And 1161 they brought 71 5627 the young man 3816 alive 2198 5723, and 2532 were 3870 0 not 3756 a little 3357 comforted 3870 5681. 

20:13 And 1161 we 2249 went before 4281 5631 to 1909 ship 4143, and sailed 321 5681 unto 1519 Assos 789, there 1564 intending 3195 5723 to take in 353 5721 Paul 3972: for 1063 so 3779 had he 2258 5713 appointed 1299 5772, minding 3195 5723 himself 846 to go afoot 3978 5721. 

20:14 And 1161 when 5613 he met 4820 5627 with us 2254 at 1519 Assos 789, we took 353 0 him 846 in 353 5631, and came 2064 5627 to 1519 Mitylene 3412. 

20:15 And 2547 0 we sailed 636 5660 thence 2547, and came 2658 5656 the next 1966 5752 [day] over against 481 Chios 5508; and 1161 the next 2087 [day] we arrived 3846 5627 at 1519 Samos 4544, and 2532 tarried 3306 5660 at 1722 Trogyllium 5175; and the next 2192 5746 [day] we came 2064 5627 to 1519 Miletus 3399. 

20:16 For 1063 Paul 3972 had determined 2919 5656 to sail by 3896 5658 Ephesus 2181, because 3704 he 846 would 1096 5638 not 3361 spend the time 5551 5658 in 1722 Asia 773: for 1063 he hasted 4692 5707, if 1487 it were 2258 5713 possible 1415 for him 846, to be 1096 5635 at 1519 Jerusalem 2414 the day 2250 of Pentecost 4005. 

20:17 And 1161 from 575 Miletus 3399 he sent 3992 5660 to 1519 Ephesus 2181, and called 3686 5668 the elders 4245 of the church 1577. 

20:18 And 1161 when 5613 they were come 3854 5633 to 4314 him 846, he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Ye 5210 know 1987 5736, from 575 the first 4413 day 2250 that 575 3739 I came 1910 5627 into 1519 Asia 773, after what manner 4459 I have been 1096 5633 with 3326 you 5216 at all 3956 seasons 5550, 

20:19 Serving 1398 5723 the Lord 2962 with 3326 all 3956 humility of mind 5012, and 2532 with many 4183 tears 1144, and 2532 temptations 3986, which 3588 befell 4819 5631 me 3427 by 1722 the lying in wait 1917 of the Jews 2453: 

20:20 [And] how 5613 I kept back 5288 5668 nothing 3762 that was profitable 4851 5723 [unto you], but 3361 have shewed 312 5658 you 5213, and 2532 have taught 1321 5658 you 5209 publickly 1219, and 2532 from 2596 house to house 3624, 

20:21 Testifying 1263 5740 both 5037 to the Jews 2453, and also 2532 to the Greeks 1672, repentance 3341 toward 1519 God 2316, and 2532 faith 4102 toward our 2257 Lord 2962 Jesus 2424 Christ 5547. 

20:22 And 2532 now 3568, behold 2400 5628, I 1473 go 4198 5736 bound 1210 5772 in the spirit 4151 unto 1519 Jerusalem 2419, not 3361 knowing 1492 5761 the things that shall befall 4876 5694 me 3427 there 1722 846: 

20:23 Save 4133 that 3754 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 witnesseth 1263 5736 in every 2596 city 4172, saying 3004 5723 that 3754 bonds 1199 and 2532 afflictions 2347 abide 3306 5719 me 3165. 

20:24 But 235 none 3762 of these things 3056 move me 4160 5731, neither 3761 count I 2192 5719 my 3450 life 5590 dear 5093 unto myself 1683, so 5613 that I might finish 5048 5658 my 3450 course 1408 with 3326 joy 5479, and 2532 the ministry 1248, which 3739 I have received 2983 5627 of 3844 the Lord 2962 Jesus 2424, to testify 1263 5664 the gospel 2098 of the grace 5485 of God 2316. 

20:25 And 2532 now 3568, behold 2400 5628, I 1473 know 1492 5758 that 3754 ye 5210 all 3956, among 1722 whom 3739 I have gone 1330 5627 preaching 2784 5723 the kingdom 932 of God 2316, shall see 3700 5695 my 3450 face 4383 no more 3765. 

20:26 Wherefore 1352 I take 3143 0 you 5213 to record 3143 5736 this 1722 4594 day 2250, that 3754 I 1473 [am] pure 2513 from 575 the blood 129 of all 3956 [men]. 

20:27 For 1063 I have 5288 0 not 3756 3361 shunned 5288 5668 to declare 312 5658 unto you 5213 all 3956 the counsel 1012 of God 2316. 

20:28 Take heed 4337 5720 therefore 3767 unto yourselves 1438, and 2532 to all 3956 the flock 4168, over 1722 the which 3739 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 hath made 5087 5639 you 5209 overseers 1985, to feed 4165 5721 the church 1577 of God 2316, which 3739 he hath purchased 4046 5668 with 1223 his own 2398 blood 129. 

20:29 For 1063 I 1473 know 1492 5758 this 5124, that 3754 after 3326 my 3450 departing 867 shall grievous 926 wolves 3074 enter in 1525 5695 among 1519 you 5209, not 3361 sparing 5339 5740 the flock 4168. 

20:30 Also 2532 of 1537 your 5216 own selves 846 shall 450 0 men 435 arise 450 5698, speaking 2980 5723 perverse things 1294 5772, to draw away 645 5721 disciples 3101 after 3694 them 848. 

20:31 Therefore 1352 watch 1127 5720, and remember 3421 5723, that 3754 by the space of three years 5148 I ceased 3973 5668 not 3756 to warn 3560 5723 every 1538 one 1520 night 3571 and 2532 day 2250 with 3326 tears 1144. 

20:32 And 2532 now 3569, brethren 80, I commend 3908 5731 you 5209 to God 2316, and 2532 to the word 3056 of his 846 grace 5485, which 3588 is able 1410 5740 to build you up 2026 5658, and 2532 to give 1325 5629 you 5213 an inheritance 2817 among 1722 all 3956 them which are sanctified 37 5772. 

20:33 I have coveted 1937 5656 no man's 3762 silver 694, or 2228 gold 5553, or 2228 apparel 2441. 

20:34 Yea 1161, ye yourselves 846 know 1097 5719, that 3754 these 3778 hands 5495 have ministered 5256 5656 unto my 3450 necessities 5532, and 2532 to them that were 5607 5752 with 3326 me 1700. 

20:35 I have shewed 5263 5656 you 5213 all things 3956, how that 3754 so 3779 labouring 2872 5723 ye ought 1163 5748 to support 482 5738 the weak 770 5723, and 5037 to remember 3421 5721 the words 3056 of the Lord 2962 Jesus 2424, how 3754 he said 2036 5627, It is 2076 5748 more 3123 blessed 3107 to give 1325 5721 than 2228 to receive 2983 5721. 

20:36 And 2532 when he had thus 5023 spoken 2036 5631, he 848 kneeled 1119 down 5087 5631, and prayed 4336 5662 with 4862 them 846 all 3956. 

20:37 And 1161 they all 3956 wept 2805 1096 5633 sore 2425, and 2532 fell 1968 5631 on 1909 Paul's 3972 neck 5137, and kissed 2705 5707 him 846, 

20:38 Sorrowing 3600 5746 most of all 3122 for 1909 the words 3056 which 3739 he spake 2046 5715, that 3754 they should 3195 5719 see 2334 5721 his 846 face 4383 no more 3765. And 1161 they accompanied 4311 5707 him 846 unto 1519 the ship 4143. 

21:1 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, that after 5613 we 2248 were gotten 645 5685 from 575 them 846, and had launched 321 5683, we came 2064 5627 with a straight course 2113 5660 unto 1519 Coos 2972, and 1161 the [day] following 1836 unto 1519 Rhodes 4499, and from thence 2547 unto 1519 Patara 3959: 

21:2 And 2532 finding 2147 5631 a ship 4143 sailing over 1276 5723 unto 1519 Phenicia 5403, we went aboard 1910 5631, and set forth 321 5681. 

21:3 Now 1161 when we had discovered 398 5631 Cyprus 2954, 2532 we left 2641 5631 it 846 on the left hand 2176, and sailed 4126 5707 into 1519 Syria 4947, and 2532 landed 2609 5648 at 1519 Tyre 5184: for 1063 there 1566 the ship 4143 was 2258 5713 to unlade 670 5740 her burden 1117. 

21:4 And 2532 finding 429 5631 disciples 3101, we tarried 1961 5656 there 847 seven 2033 days 2250: who 3748 said 3004 5707 to Paul 3972 through 1223 the Spirit 4151, that he should 305 0 not 3361 go up 305 5721 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419. 

21:5 And 1161 when 3753 we 2248 had 1096 5633 accomplished 1822 5658 those days 2250, we departed 1831 5631 and went our way 4198 5711; and they all 3956 brought 4311 0 us 2248 on our way 4311 5723, with 4862 wives 1135 and 2532 children 5043, till 2193 [we were] out of 1854 the city 4172: and 2532 we kneeled down 5087 5631 1119 on 1909 the shore 123, and prayed 4336 5662. 

21:6 And 2532 when we had taken our leave 782 5666 one of another 240, we took 1910 5627 1519 ship 4143; and 1161 they 1565 returned 5290 0 1519 home 2398 again 5290 5656. 

21:7 And 1161 when we 2249 had finished 1274 5660 [our] course 4144 from 575 Tyre 5184, we came 2658 5656 to 1519 Ptolemais 4424, and 2532 saluted 782 5666 the brethren 80, and abode 3306 5656 with 3844 them 846 one 3391 day 2250. 

21:8 And 1161 the next 1887 [day] we that were of 4012 0 Paul's 3972 company 4012 departed 1831 5631, and came 2064 5627 5625 2064 5627 unto 1519 Caesarea 2542: and 2532 we entered 1525 5631 into 1519 the house 3624 of Philip 5376 the evangelist 2099, which was 5607 5752 [one] of 1537 the seven 2033; and abode 3306 5656 with 3844 him 846. 

21:9 And 1161 the same man 5129 had 2258 5713 four 5064 daughters 2364, virgins 3933, which did prophesy 4395 5723. 

21:10 And 1161 as we 2257 tarried 1961 5723 [there] many 4119 days 2250, there came down 2718 5627 from 575 Judaea 2449 a certain 5100 prophet 4396, named 3686 Agabus 13. 

21:11 And 2532 when he was come 2064 5631 unto 4314 us 2248, 2532 he took 142 5660 Paul's 3972 girdle 2223, and 5037 bound 1210 5660 his own 848 hands 5495 and 2532 feet 4228, and said 2036 5627, Thus 3592 saith 3004 5719 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, So 3779 shall 1210 0 the Jews 2453 at 1722 Jerusalem 2419 bind 1210 5692 the man 435 that 3739 owneth 2076 5748 this 3778 girdle 2223, and 2532 shall deliver 3860 5692 [him] into 1519 the hands 5495 of the Gentiles 1484. 

21:12 And 1161 when 5613 we heard 191 5656 these things 5023, both 5037 we 2249, and 2532 they of that place 1786, besought 3870 5707 him 846 not 3361 to go up 305 5721 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419. 

21:13 Then 1161 Paul 3972 answered 611 5662, What 5101 mean ye 4160 5719 to weep 2799 5723 and 2532 to break 4919 5723 mine 3450 heart 2588? for 1063 I 1473 am 2192 5719 ready 2093 not 3756 to be bound 1210 5683 only 3440, but 2532 also 235 to die 599 5629 at 1519 Jerusalem 2419 for 5228 the name 3686 of the Lord 2962 Jesus 2424. 

21:14 And 1161 when he would 3982 0 not 3361 be persuaded 3982 5746, we ceased 2270 5656, saying 2036 5631, The will 2307 of the Lord 2962 be done 1096 5634. 

21:15 And 1161 after 3326 those 5025 days 2250 we took up our carriages 643 5666, and went up 305 5707 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419. 

21:16 1161 There went 4905 5627 with 4862 us 2254 also 2532 [certain] of the disciples 3101 of 575 Caesarea 2542, and brought 71 5723 with them 3844 one 5100 Mnason 3416 of Cyprus 2953, an old 744 disciple 3101, with whom 3739 we should lodge 3579 5686. 

21:17 And 1161 when we 2257 were come 1096 5637 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414, the brethren 80 received 1209 5662 us 2248 gladly 780. 

21:18 And 1161 the [day] following 1966 5752 Paul 3972 went in 1524 5715 with 4862 us 2254 unto 4314 James 2385; and 5037 all 3956 the elders 4245 were present 3854 5633. 

21:19 And 2532 when he had saluted 782 5666 them 846, he declared 1834 5711 particularly 2596 1520 1538 what things 3739 God 2316 had wrought 4160 5656 among 1722 the Gentiles 1484 by 1223 his 846 ministry 1248. 

21:20 And 1161 when they heard 191 5660 [it], they glorified 1392 5707 the Lord 2962, and 5037 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Thou seest 2334 5719, brother 80, how many 4214 thousands 3461 of Jews 2453 there are 1526 5748 which 3588 believe 4100 5761; and 2532 they are 5225 5719 all 3956 zealous 2207 of the law 3551: 

21:21 And 1161 they are informed 2727 5681 of 4012 thee 4675, that 3754 thou teachest 1321 5719 all 3956 the Jews 2453 which are among 2596 the Gentiles 1484 to 575 forsake 646 Moses 3475, saying 3004 5723 that they ought 4059 0 not 3361 to circumcise 4059 5721 [their] children 5043, neither 3366 to walk 4043 5721 after the customs 1485. 

21:22 What 5101 is it 2076 5748 therefore 3767? the multitude 4128 must 1163 5748 needs 3843 come together 4905 5629: for 1063 they will hear 191 5695 that 3754 thou art come 2064 5754. 

21:23 Do 4160 5657 therefore 3767 this 5124 that 3739 we say 3004 5719 to thee 4671: We 2254 have 1526 5748 four 5064 men 435 which have 2171 a vow 2192 5723 on 1909 them 1438; 

21:24 Them 5128 take 3880 5631, and purify thyself 48 5682 with 4862 them 846, and 2532 be at charges 1159 5657 with 1909 them 846, that 2443 they may shave 3587 5667 [their] heads 2776: and 2532 all 3956 may know 1097 5632 that those things 3754, whereof 3739 they were informed 2727 5769 concerning 4012 thee 4675, are 2076 5748 nothing 3762; but 235 [that] thou thyself 846 also 2532 walkest orderly 4748 5719, and keepest 5442 5723 the law 3551. 

21:25 As 1161 touching 4012 the Gentiles 1484 which believe 4100 5761, we 2249 have written 1989 5656 [and] concluded 2919 5660 that they 846 observe 5083 5721 no 3367 such thing 5108, save only 1508 that they keep 5442 5733 themselves 846 from 5037 [things] offered to idols 1494, and 2532 from blood 129, and 2532 from strangled 4156, and 2532 from fornication 4202. 

21:26 Then 5119 Paul 3972 took 3880 5631 the men 435, and the next 2192 5746 day 2250 purifying himself 48 5685 with 4862 them 846 entered 1524 5715 into 1519 the temple 2411, to signify 1229 5723 the accomplishment 1604 of the days 2250 of purification 49, until 2193 that 3739 an offering 4376 should be offered 4374 5681 for 5228 every 1538 one 1520 of them 846. 

21:27 And 1161 when 5613 the seven 2033 days 2250 were almost 3195 5707 ended 4931 5745, the Jews 2453 which were of 575 Asia 773, when they saw 2300 5666 him 846 in 1722 the temple 2411, stirred up 4797 5707 all 3956 the people 3793, and 2532 laid 1911 5627 hands 5495 on 1909 him 846, 

21:28 Crying out 2896 5723, Men 435 of Israel 2475, help 997 5720: This 3778 is 2076 5748 the man 444, that teacheth 1321 5723 all 3956 [men] every where 3837 against 2596 the people 2992, and 2532 the law 3551, and 2532 this 5126 place 5117: and 5037 further 2089 brought 1521 5627 Greeks 1672 also 2532 into 1519 the temple 2411, and 2532 hath polluted 2840 5758 this 5127 holy 40 place 5117. 

21:29 (For 1063 they had 2258 5713 seen before 4308 5761 with 4862 him 846 in 1722 the city 4172 Trophimus 5161 an Ephesian 2180, whom 3739 they supposed 3543 5707 that 3754 Paul 3972 had brought 1521 5627 into 1519 the temple 2411) 

21:30 And 5037 all 3650 the city 4172 was moved 2795 5681, and 2532 the people 2992 ran together 1096 5633 4890: and 2532 they took 1949 5637 Paul 3972, and drew 1670 5707 him 846 out of 1854 the temple 2411: and 2532 forthwith 2112 the doors 2374 were shut 2808 5681. 

21:31 And 1161 as they went about 2212 5723 to kill 615 5658 him 846, tidings 5334 came 305 5627 unto the chief captain 5506 of the band 4686, that 3754 all 3650 Jerusalem 2419 was in an uproar 4797 5769. 

21:32 Who 3739 immediately 1824 took 3880 5631 soldiers 4757 and 2532 centurions 1543, and ran down 2701 5627 unto 1909 them 846: and 1161 when they saw 1492 5631 the chief captain 5506 and 2532 the soldiers 4757, they left 3973 5668 beating 5180 5723 of Paul 3972. 

21:33 Then 5119 the chief captain 5506 came near 1448 5660, and took 1949 5633 him 846, and 2532 commanded 2753 5656 [him] to be bound with 1210 5683 two 1417 chains 254; and 2532 demanded 4441 5711 who 5101 he was 302 1498 5751, and 2532 what 5101 he had 2076 5748 done 4160 5761. 

21:34 And 1161 some 243 cried 994 5707 one thing 5100, some another 243, among 1722 the multitude 3793: and 1161 when he could 1410 5740 not 3361 know 1097 5629 the certainty 804 for 1223 the tumult 2351, he commanded 2753 5656 him 846 to be carried 71 5745 into 1519 the castle 3925. 

21:35 And 1161 when 3753 he came 1096 5633 upon 1909 the stairs 304, so it was 4819 5627, that he was borne 941 5745 of 5259 the soldiers 4757 for 1223 the violence 970 of the people 3793. 

21:36 For 1063 the multitude 4128 of the people 2992 followed after 190 5707, crying 2896 5723, Away 142 5720 with him 846. 

21:37 And 5037 as Paul 3972 was to be 3195 5723 led 1521 5745 into 1519 the castle 3925, he said 3004 5719 unto the chief captain 5506, May 1487 1832 5748 I 3427 speak 2036 5629 5100 unto 4314 thee 4571? 1161 Who 3588 said 5346 5713, Canst thou speak 1097 5719 Greek 1676? 

21:38 Art 1488 5748 not 3756 thou 4771 686 that Egyptian 124, which before 4253 these 5130 days 2250 madest an uproar 387 5660, and 2532 leddest out 1806 5631 into 1519 the wilderness 2048 four thousand 5070 men 435 that were murderers 4607? 

21:39 But 1161 Paul 3972 said 2036 5627, I 1473 am 1510 5748 3303 a man 444 [which am] a Jew 2453 of Tarsus 5018, [a city] in Cilicia 2791, a citizen 4177 of no 3756 mean 767 city 4172: and 1161, I beseech 1189 5736 thee 4675, suffer 2010 5657 me 3427 to speak 2980 5658 unto 4314 the people 2992. 

21:40 And 1161 when he had given 2010 0 him 846 licence 2010 5660, Paul 3972 stood 2476 5761 on 1909 the stairs 304, and beckoned 2678 5656 with the hand 5495 unto the people 2992. And 1161 when there was made 1096 5637 a great 4183 silence 4602, he spake 4377 5656 unto [them] in the Hebrew 1446 tongue 1258, saying 3004 5723, 

22:1 Men 435, brethren 80, and 2532 fathers 3962, hear ye 191 5657 my 3450 defence 627 [which I make] now 3568 unto 4314 you 5209. 

22:2 (And 1161 when they heard 191 5660 that 3754 he spake 4377 5707 in the Hebrew 1446 tongue 1258 to them 846, they kept 3930 5627 the more 3123 silence 2271: and 2532 he saith 5346 5748) 

22:3 I 1473 am 1510 5748 verily 3303 a man 435 [which am] a Jew 2453, born 1080 5772 in 1722 Tarsus 5019, [a city] in Cilicia 2791, yet 1161 brought up 397 5772 in 1722 this 5026 city 4172 at 3844 the feet 4228 of Gamaliel 1059, [and] taught 3811 5772 according 2596 to the perfect manner 195 of the law 3551 of the fathers 3971, and was 5225 5723 zealous 2207 toward God 2316, as 2531 ye 5210 all 3956 are 2075 5748 this day 4594. 

22:4 And I 3739 persecuted 1377 5656 this 5026 way 3598 unto 891 the death 2288, binding 1195 5723 and 2532 delivering 3860 5723 into 1519 prisons 5438 both 5037 men 435 and 2532 women 1135. 

22:5 As 5613 also 2532 the high priest 749 doth bear 3140 0 me 3427 witness 3140 5719, and 2532 all 3956 the estate of the elders 4244: from 3844 whom 3739 also 2532 I received 1209 5666 letters 1992 unto 4314 the brethren 80, and 2532 went 4198 5711 to 1519 Damascus 1154, to bring 71 5694 them which were 5607 5752 there 1566 bound 1210 5772 unto 1519 Jerusalem 2419, for to 2443 be punished 5097 5686. 

22:6 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, that, as I made 4198 0 my 3427 journey 4198 5740, and 2532 was come nigh 1448 5723 unto Damascus 1154 about 4012 noon 3314, suddenly 1810 there shone 4015 0 from 1537 heaven 3772 a great 2425 light 5457 round 4015 5658 about 4012 me 1691. 

22:7 And 5037 I fell 4098 5627 unto 1519 the ground 1475, and 2532 heard 191 5656 a voice 5456 saying 3004 5723 unto me 3427, Saul 4549, Saul 4549, why 5101 persecutest thou 1377 5719 me 3165? 

22:8 And 1161 I 1473 answered 611 5662, Who 5101 art thou 1488 5748, Lord 2962? And 5037 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 me 3165, I 1473 am 1510 5748 Jesus 2424 of Nazareth 3480, whom 3739 thou 4771 persecutest 1377 5719. 

22:9 And 1161 they that were 5607 5752 with 4862 me 1698 saw 2300 5662 indeed 3303 the light 5457, and 2532 were 1096 5633 afraid 1719; but 1161 they heard 191 5656 not 3756 the voice 5456 of him that spake 2980 5723 to me 3427. 

22:10 And 1161 I said 2036 5627, What 5101 shall I do 4160 5661, Lord 2962? And 1161 the Lord 2962 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 me 3165, Arise 450 5631, and go 4198 5737 into 1519 Damascus 1154; and there 2546 it shall be told 2980 5701 thee 4671 of 4012 all things 3956 which 3739 are appointed 5021 5769 for thee 4671 to do 4160 5658. 

22:11 And 1161 when 5613 I could 1689 0 not 3756 see 1689 5707 for 575 the glory 1391 of that 1565 light 5457, being led by the hand 5496 5746 of 5259 them that were 4895 5752 with me 3427, I came 2064 5627 into 1519 Damascus 1154. 

22:12 And 1161 one 5100 Ananias 367, a devout 2152 man 435 according 2596 to the law 3551, having a good report 3140 5746 of 5259 all 3956 the Jews 2453 which dwelt 2730 5723 [there], 

22:13 Came 2064 5631 unto 4314 me 3165, and 2532 stood 2186 5631, and said 2036 5627 unto me 3427, Brother 80 Saul 4549, receive thy sight 308 5657. And 2504 0 the same 846 hour 5610 I 2504 looked up 308 5656 upon 1519 him 846. 

22:14 And 1161 he said 2036 5627, The God 2316 of our 2257 fathers 3962 hath chosen 4400 5662 thee 4571, that thou shouldest know 1097 5629 his 848 will 2307, and 2532 see 1492 5629 that Just One 1342, and 2532 shouldest hear 191 5658 the voice 5456 of 1537 his 846 mouth 4750. 

22:15 For 3754 thou shalt be 2071 5704 his 846 witness 3144 unto 4314 all 3956 men 444 of what 3739 thou hast seen 3708 5758 and 2532 heard 191 5656. 

22:16 And 2532 now 3568 why 5101 tarriest thou 3195 5719? arise 450 5631, and be baptized 907 5669, and 2532 wash away 628 5669 thy 4675 sins 266, calling on 1941 5671 the name 3686 of the Lord 2962. 

22:17 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, that, when I 3427 was come again 5290 5660 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419, even 2532 while I 3450 prayed 4336 5740 in 1722 the temple 2411, I 3165 was 1096 5635 in 1722 a trance 1611; 

22:18 And 2532 saw 1492 5629 him 846 saying 3004 5723 unto me 3427, Make haste 4692 5657, and 2532 get thee 1831 5628 quickly 5034 1722 out of 1537 Jerusalem 2419: for 1360 they will 3858 0 not 3756 receive 3858 5699 thy 4675 testimony 3141 concerning 4012 me 1700. 

22:19 And I 2504 said 2036 5627, Lord 2962, they 846 know 1987 5736 that 3754 I 1473 imprisoned 2252 5713 5439 5723 and 2532 beat 1194 5723 in every 2596 synagogue 4864 them that believed 4100 5723 on 1909 thee 4571: 

22:20 And 2532 when 3753 the blood 129 of thy 4675 martyr 3144 Stephen 4736 was shed 1632 5712, I 846 also 2532 was 2252 5713 standing by 2186 5761, and 2532 consenting 4909 5723 unto his 846 death 336, and 2532 kept 5442 5723 the raiment 2440 of them that slew 337 5723 him 846. 

22:21 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 me 3165, Depart 4198 5737: for 3754 I 1473 will send 1821 5692 thee 4571 far hence 3112 unto 1519 the Gentiles 1484. 

22:22 And 1161 they gave 191 0 him 846 audience 191 5707 unto 891 this 5127 word 3056, and 2532 [then] lifted up 1869 5656 their 848 voices 5456, and said 3004 5723, Away with 142 5720 such 5108 a [fellow] from 575 the earth 1093: for 1063 it is 2520 0 not 3756 fit 2520 5723 that he 846 should live 2198 5721. 

22:23 And 1161 as they cried out 2905 5723, and 2532 cast off 4495 5723 [their] clothes 2440, and 2532 threw 906 5723 dust 2868 into 1519 the air 109, 

22:24 The chief captain 5506 commanded 2753 5656 him 846 to be brought 71 5745 into 1519 the castle 3925, and bade 2036 5631 that he 846 should be examined 426 5745 by scourging 3148; that 2443 he might know 1921 5632 wherefore 1223 3739 156 they cried 2019 0 so 3779 against 2019 5707 him 846. 

22:25 And 1161 as 5613 they bound 4385 5656 5625 4385 5656 him 846 with thongs 2438, Paul 3972 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 the centurion 1543 that stood by 2476 5761, Is it lawful 1487 1832 5748 for you 5213 to scourge 3147 5721 a man 444 that is a Roman 4514, and 2532 uncondemned 178? 

22:26 When 1161 the centurion 1543 heard 191 5660 [that], he went 4334 5631 and told 518 5656 the chief captain 5506, saying 3004 5723, Take heed 3708 5720 what 5101 thou doest 3195 5719 4160 5721: for 1063 this 3778 man 444 is 2076 5748 a Roman 4514. 

22:27 Then 1161 the chief captain 5506 came 4334 5631, and said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Tell 3004 5720 me 3427, 1487 art 1488 5748 thou 4771 a Roman 4514? 1161 He said 5346 5713, Yea 3483. 

22:28 And 5037 the chief captain 5506 answered 611 5662, With a great 4183 sum 2774 obtained 2932 5662 I 1473 this 5026 freedom 4174. And 1161 Paul 3972 said 5346 5713, But 1161 I 1473 2532 was [free] born 1080 5769. 

22:29 Then 3767 straightway 2112 they departed 868 5627 from 575 him 846 which 3588 should 3195 5723 have examined 426 5721 him 846: and 1161 the chief captain 5506 also 2532 was afraid 5399 5675, after he knew 1921 5631 that 3754 he was 2076 5748 a Roman 4514, and 2532 because 3754 he had 2258 5713 bound 1210 5761 him 846. 

22:30 1161 On the morrow 1887, because he would 1014 5740 have known 1097 5629 the certainty 804 wherefore 5101 he was accused 2723 5743 of 3844 the Jews 2453, he loosed 3089 5656 him 846 from 575 [his] bands 1199, and 2532 commanded 2753 5656 the chief priests 749 and 2532 all 3650 their 846 council 4892 to appear 2064 5629, and 2532 brought 2609 0 Paul 3972 down 2609 5631, and set him 2476 5656 before 1519 them 846. 

23:1 And 1161 Paul 3972, earnestly beholding 816 5660 the council 4892, said 2036 5627, Men 435 [and] brethren 80, I 1473 have lived 4176 5769 in all 3956 good 18 conscience 4893 before God 2316 until 891 this 5026 day 2250. 

23:2 And 1161 the high priest 749 Ananias 367 commanded 2004 5656 them that stood by 3936 5761 him 848 to smite 5180 5721 him 846 on the mouth 4750. 

23:3 Then 5119 said 2036 5627 Paul 3972 unto 4314 him 846, God 2316 shall 3195 5719 smite 5180 5721 thee 4571, [thou] whited 2867 5772 wall 5109: for 2532 sittest 2521 5736 thou 4771 to judge 2919 5723 me 3165 after 2596 the law 3551, and 2532 commandest 2753 5719 me 3165 to be smitten 5180 5745 contrary to the law 3891 5723? 

23:4 And 1161 they that stood by 3936 5761 said 2036 5627, Revilest thou 3058 5719 God's 2316 high priest 749? 

23:5 Then 5037 said 5346 5713 Paul 3972, I wist 1492 5715 not 3756, brethren 80, that 3754 he was 2076 5748 the high priest 749: for 1063 it is written 1125 5769, Thou shalt 2046 0 not 3756 speak 2046 5692 evil 2560 of the ruler 758 of thy 4675 people 2992. 

23:6 But 1161 when Paul 3972 perceived 1097 5631 that 3754 the one 1520 part 3313 were 2076 5748 Sadducees 4523, and 1161 the other 2087 Pharisees 5330, he cried out 2896 5656 in 1722 the council 4892, Men 435 [and] brethren 80, I 1473 am 1510 5748 a Pharisee 5330, the son 5207 of a Pharisee 5330: of 4012 the hope 1680 and 2532 resurrection 386 of the dead 3498 I 1473 am called in question 2919 5743. 

23:7 And 1161 when he had 2980 0 so 5124 said 2980 5660, there arose 1096 5633 a dissension 4714 between the Pharisees 5330 and 2532 the Sadducees 4523: and 2532 the multitude 4128 was divided 4977 5681. 

23:8 For 1063 3303 the Sadducees 4523 say 3004 5719 that there is 1511 5750 no 3361 resurrection 386, neither 3366 angel 32, nor 3383 spirit 4151: but 1161 the Pharisees 5330 confess 3670 5719 both 297. 

23:9 And 1161 there arose 1096 5633 a great 3173 cry 2906: and 2532 the scribes 1122 [that were] of the Pharisees 5330' part 3313 arose 450 5631, and strove 1264 5711, saying 3004 5723, We find 2147 5719 no 3762 evil 2556 in 1722 this 5129 man 444: but 1161 if 1487 a spirit 4151 or 2228 an angel 32 hath spoken 2980 5656 to him 846, let us 2313 0 not 3361 fight 2313 5725 against God. 

23:10 And 1161 when there arose 1096 5637 a great 4183 dissension 4714, the chief captain 5506, fearing 2125 5685 lest 3361 Paul 3972 should have been pulled in pieces 1288 5686 of 5259 them 846, commanded 2753 5656 the soldiers 4753 to go down 2597 5631, and to take 726 0 him 846 by force 726 5658 from 1537 among 3319 them 846, and 5037 to bring 71 5721 [him] into 1519 the castle 3925. 

23:11 And 1161 the night 3571 following 1966 5752 the Lord 2962 stood by 2186 5631 him 846, and said 2036 5627, Be of good cheer 2293 5720, Paul 3972: for 1063 as 5613 thou hast testified 1263 5662 of 4012 me 1700 in 1519 Jerusalem 2419, so 3779 must 1163 5748 thou 4571 bear witness 3140 5658 also 2532 at 1519 Rome 4516. 

23:12 And 1161 when it was 1096 5637 day 2250, certain 5100 of the Jews 2453 banded together 4160 5660 4963, and bound 332 0 themselves 1438 under a curse 332 5656, saying 3004 5723 that they would 5315 0 neither 3383 eat 5315 5629 nor 3383 drink 4095 5629 till 2193 they had killed 615 5725 Paul 3972. 

23:13 And 1161 they were 2258 5713 more than 4119 forty 5062 which 3588 had made 4160 5761 this 5026 conspiracy 4945. 

23:14 And they 3748 came to 4334 5631 the chief priests 749 and 2532 elders 4245, and said 2036 5627, We have bound 332 5656 ourselves 1438 under a great curse 331, that we will eat 1089 5664 nothing 3367 until 2193 3739 we have slain 615 5725 Paul 3972. 

23:15 Now 3568 therefore 3767 ye 5210 with 4862 the council 4892 signify 1718 5657 to the chief captain 5506 that 3704 he bring 2609 0 him 846 down 2609 5632 unto 4314 you 5209 to morrow 839, as 5613 though ye would 3195 5723 enquire 1231 5721 something more perfectly 197 concerning 4012 him 846: and 1161 we 2249, or ever 4253 he 846 come near 1448 5658, are 2070 5748 ready 2092 to kill 337 5629 him 846. 

23:16 And 1161 when Paul's 3972 sister's 79 son 5207 heard 191 5660 of their lying in wait 1749, he went 3854 5637 and 2532 entered 1525 5631 into 1519 the castle 3925, and told 518 5656 Paul 3972. 

23:17 Then 1161 Paul 3972 called 4341 5666 one 1520 of the centurions 1543 unto [him], and said 5346 5713, Bring 520 5628 this 5126 young man 3494 unto 4314 the chief captain 5506: for 1063 he hath 2192 5719 a certain thing 5100 to tell 518 5658 him 846. 

23:18 So 3767 3303 he took 3880 5631 him 846, and brought 71 5627 [him] to 4314 the chief captain 5506, and 2532 said 5346 5748, Paul 3972 the prisoner 1198 called 4341 5666 me 3165 unto [him], and prayed me 2065 5656 to bring 71 5629 this 5126 young man 3494 unto 4314 thee 4571, who hath 2192 5723 something 5100 to say 2980 5658 unto thee 4671. 

23:19 Then 1161 the chief captain 5506 took 1949 5637 him 846 by the hand 5495, and 2532 went [with him] aside 402 5660 privately 2596 2398, and asked 4441 5711 [him], What 5101 is 2076 5748 that thou hast 2192 5719 to tell 518 5658 me 3427? 

23:20 And 1161 he said 2036 5627, 3754 The Jews 2453 have agreed 4934 5639 to desire 2065 5658 thee 4571 that 3704 thou wouldest bring down 2609 5632 Paul 3972 to morrow 839 into 1519 the council 4892, as 5613 though they would 3195 5723 enquire 4441 5738 somewhat 5100 of 4012 him 846 more perfectly 197. 

23:21 But 3767 do 3982 0 not 3361 thou 4771 yield 3982 5686 unto them 846: for 1063 there lie in wait for 1748 5719 him 846 of 1537 them 846 more than 4119 forty 5062 men 435, which 3748 have bound 332 0 themselves 1438 with an oath 332 5656, that they will 5315 0 neither 3383 eat 5315 5629 nor 3383 drink 4095 5629 till 2193 they have killed 337 5661 him 846: and 2532 now 3568 are they 1526 5748 ready 2092, looking for 4327 5740 a promise 1860 from 575 thee 4675. 

23:22 So 3303 3767 the chief captain 5506 [then] let 630 0 the young man 3494 depart 630 5656, and charged 3853 5660 [him, See thou] tell 1583 5658 no man 3367 that 3754 thou hast shewed 1718 5656 these things 5023 to 4314 me 3165. 

23:23 And 2532 he called unto 4341 5666 [him] 5100 two 1417 centurions 1543, saying 2036 5627, Make ready 2090 5657 two hundred 1250 soldiers 4757 to 3704 go 4198 5680 to 2193 Caesarea 2542, and 2532 horsemen 2460 threescore and ten 1440, and 2532 spearmen 1187 two hundred 1250, at 575 the third 5154 hour 5610 of the night 3571; 

23:24 And 5037 provide 3936 5658 [them] beasts 2934, that 2443 they may set 1913 0 Paul 3972 on 1913 5660, and bring [him] safe 1295 5661 unto 4314 Felix 5344 the governor 2232. 

23:25 And he wrote 1125 5660 a letter 1992 after 4023 5723 this 5126 manner 5179: 

23:26 Claudius 2804 Lysias 3079 unto the most excellent 2903 governor 2232 Felix 5344 [sendeth] greeting 5463 5721. 

23:27 This 5126 man 435 was taken 4815 5685 of 5259 the Jews 2453, and 2532 should 3195 5723 have been killed 337 5745 of 5259 them 846: then came I 2186 5631 with 4862 an army 4753, and rescued 1807 5639 him 846, having understood 3129 5631 that 3754 he was 2076 5748 a Roman 4514. 

23:28 And 1161 when 1014 0 I would 1014 5740 have known 1097 5629 the cause 156 wherefore 1223 3739 they accused 1458 5707 him 846, I brought 2609 0 him 846 forth 2609 5627 into 1519 their 846 council 4892: 

23:29 Whom 3739 I perceived 2147 5627 to be accused 1458 5746 of 4012 questions 2213 of their 846 law 3551, but 1161 to have 2192 5723 nothing 3367 laid to his charge 1462 worthy 514 of death 2288 or 2228 of bonds 1199. 

23:30 And 1161 when it was told 3377 5685 me 3427 how that 5259 the Jews 2453 laid wait 1917 3195 5721 1510 5705 for 1519 the man 435, I sent 3992 5656 straightway 1824 to 4314 thee 4571, and gave commandment 3853 5660 to his accusers 2725 also 2532 to say 3004 5721 before 1909 thee 4675 what [they had] against 4314 him 846. Farewell 4517 5770. 

23:31 Then 3767 3303 the soldiers 4757, as 2596 it was commanded 1299 5772 them 846, took 353 5631 Paul 3972, and brought 71 5627 [him] by 1223 night 3571 to 1519 Antipatris 494. 

23:32 1161 On the morrow 1887 they left 1439 5660 the horsemen 2460 to go 4198 5738 with 4862 him 846, and returned 5290 5656 to 1519 the castle 3925: 

23:33 Who 3748, when they came 1525 5631 to 1519 Caesarea 2542, and 2532 delivered 325 5631 the epistle 1992 to the governor 2232, presented 3936 5656 Paul 3972 also 2532 before him 846. 

23:34 And 1161 when the governor 2232 had read 314 5631 [the letter], 2532 he asked 1905 5660 of 1537 what 4169 province 1885 he was 2076 5748. And 2532 when he understood 4441 5637 that 3754 [he was] of 575 Cilicia 2791; 

23:35 I will hear 1251 5695 thee 4675, said he 5346 5713, when 3752 thine 4675 accusers 2725 are 3854 0 also 2532 come 3854 5638. And 5037 he commanded 2753 5656 him 846 to be kept 5442 5733 in 1722 Herod's 2264 judgment hall 4232. 

24:1 And 1161 after 3326 five 4002 days 2250 Ananias 367 the high priest 749 descended 2597 5627 with 3326 the elders 4245, and 2532 [with] a certain 5100 orator 4489 [named] Tertullus 5061, who 3748 informed 1718 5656 the governor 2232 against 2596 Paul 3972. 

24:2 And 1161 when he was called forth 2564 5685, Tertullus 5061 began 756 5662 to accuse 2723 5721 [him], saying 3004 5723, Seeing that by 1223 thee 4675 we enjoy 5177 5723 great 4183 quietness 1515, and 2532 that very worthy deeds 2735 are done 1096 5740 unto this 5129 nation 1484 by 1223 thy 4674 providence 4307, 

24:3 5037 We accept 588 5736 [it] always 3839, and 2532 in all places 3837, most noble 2903 Felix 5344, with 3326 all 3956 thankfulness 2169. 

24:4 Notwithstanding 1161, that 3363 0 I be 4119 0 not 3363 1909 further 4119 tedious 1465 5725 unto thee 4571, I pray 3870 5719 thee 4571 that thou wouldest hear 191 5658 us 2257 of thy 4674 clemency 1932 a few words 4935. 

24:5 For 1063 we have found 2147 5631 this 5126 man 435 [a] pestilent 3061 [fellow], and 2532 a mover 2795 5723 of sedition 4714 among all 3956 the Jews 2453 throughout 2596 the world 3625, and 5037 a ringleader 4414 of the sect 139 of the Nazarenes 3480: 

24:6 Who 3739 also 2532 hath gone about 3985 5707 to profane 953 5658 the temple 2411: 2532 whom 3739 we took 2902 5656, and 2532 would 2309 5656 have judged 2919 5721 according 2596 to our 2251 law 3551. 

24:7 But 1161 the chief captain 5506 Lysias 3079 came 3928 5631 [upon us], and with 3326 great 4183 violence 970 took [him] away 520 5627 out of 1537 our 2257 hands 5495, 

24:8 Commanding 2753 5660 his 846 accusers 2725 to come 2064 5738 unto 1909 thee 4571: by examining 350 5660 of 3844 whom 3739 thyself 846 mayest 1410 5695 take knowledge 1921 5629 of 4012 all 3956 these things 5130, whereof 3739 we 2249 accuse 2723 5719 him 846. 

24:9 And 1161 the Jews 2453 also 2532 assented 4934 5639, saying 5335 5723 that these things 5023 were 2192 5721 so 3779. 

24:10 Then 1161 Paul 3972, after that the governor 2232 had beckoned 3506 5660 unto him 846 to speak 3004 5721, answered 611 5662, Forasmuch as I know 1987 5740 that thou 4571 hast been 5607 5752 of 1537 many 4183 years 2094 a judge 2923 unto this 5129 nation 1484, I do 626 0 the more cheerfully 2115 answer 626 5736 for 4012 myself 1683: 

24:11 Because that thou 4675 mayest 1410 5740 understand 1097 5629, that 3754 there are 1526 5748 yet but 2228 3756 twelve 1177 days 2250 4119 since 575 3739 I 3427 went up 305 5627 to 1722 Jerusalem 2419 for to worship 4352 5694. 

24:12 And 2532 they neither 3777 found 2147 5627 me 3165 in 1722 the temple 2411 disputing 1256 5740 with 4314 any man 5100, neither 2228 raising up 1999 0 4160 5723 the people 3793 1999, neither 3777 in 1722 the synagogues 4864, nor 3777 in 2596 the city 4172: 

24:13 Neither 3777 can 1410 5736 they prove 3936 5658 3165 the things 4012 whereof 3739 they 2723 0 now 3568 accuse 2723 5719 me 3450. 

24:14 But 1161 this 5124 I confess 3670 5719 unto thee 4671, that 3754 after 2596 the way 3598 which 3739 they call 3004 5719 heresy 139, so 3779 worship I 3000 5719 the God 2316 of my fathers 3971, believing 4100 5723 all things 3956 which 3588 are written 1125 5772 in 2596 the law 3551 and 2532 in 1722 the prophets 4396: 

24:15 And have 2192 5723 hope 1680 toward 1519 God 2316, which 3739 they 3778 themselves 846 also 2532 allow 4327 5736, that there shall be 3195 5721 1510 5705 a resurrection 386 of the dead 3498, both 5037 of the just 1342 and 2532 unjust 94. 

24:16 And 1161 herein 1722 5129 do I exercise 778 5719 myself 846, to have 2192 5721 always 1275 a conscience 4893 void of offence 677 toward 4314 God 2316, and 2532 [toward] men 444. 

24:17 Now 1161 after 1223 many 4119 years 2094 I came 3854 5633 to bring 4160 5694 alms 1654 to 1519 my 3450 nation 1484, and 2532 offerings 4376. 

24:18 1161 Whereupon 1722 3739 certain 5100 Jews 2453 from 575 Asia 773 found 2147 5627 me 3165 purified 48 5772 in 1722 the temple 2411, neither 3756 with 3326 multitude 3793, nor 3761 with 3326 tumult 2351. 

24:19 Who 3739 ought 1163 5748 5625 1163 5713 to have been here 3918 5750 before 1909 thee 4675, and 2532 object 2723 5721, if 1536 0 they had 2192 5722 ought 1536 against 4314 me 3165. 

24:20 Or else 2228 let 2036 0 these same 3778 [here] say 2036 5628, if 1536 0 they have found 2147 5627 any 1536 evil doing 92 in 1722 me 1698, while I 3450 stood 2476 5631 before 1909 the council 4892, 

24:21 Except 2228 it be for 4012 this 5026 one 3391 voice 5456, that 3739 I cried 2896 5656 standing 2476 5761 among 1722 them 846, Touching 3754 4012 the resurrection 386 of the dead 3498 I 1473 am called in question 2919 5743 by 5259 you 5216 this day 4594. 

24:22 And 1161 when Felix 5344 heard 191 5660 these things 5023, having more perfect 197 knowledge 1492 5761 of 4012 [that] way 3598, he deferred 306 5639 them 846, and said 2036 5631, When 3752 Lysias 3079 the chief captain 5506 shall come down 2597 5632, I will know the uttermost 1231 5695 of your 5209 matter 2596. 

24:23 And 5037 he commanded 1299 5671 a centurion 1543 to keep 5083 5745 Paul 3972, and 5037 to let [him] have 2192 5721 liberty 425, and 2532 that he should forbid 2967 5721 none 3367 of his 846 acquaintance 2398 to minister 5256 5721 or 2228 come 4334 5738 unto him 846. 

24:24 And 1161 after 3326 certain 5100 days 2250, when Felix 5344 came 3854 5637 with 4862 his 848 wife 1135 Drusilla 1409, which was 5607 5752 a Jewess 2453, he sent for 3343 5662 Paul 3972, and 2532 heard 191 5656 him 846 concerning 4012 the faith 4102 in 1519 Christ 5547. 

24:25 And 1161 as he reasoned 1256 5740 of 4012 righteousness 1343, temperance 2532 1466, and 2532 judgment 2917 to come 3195 5723 1510 5705, Felix 5344 trembled 1096 5637 1719, and answered 611 5662, Go thy way 4198 5737 for this time 3568; when 1161 I have 2192 5723 3335 5631 a convenient season 2540, I will call for 3333 5698 thee 4571. 

24:26 He hoped 1679 5723 also 260 1161 2532 that 3754 money 5536 should have been given 1325 5701 him 846 of 5259 Paul 3972, that 3704 he might loose 3089 5661 him 846: wherefore 1352 he sent for 3343 5740 him 846 the oftener 4437, and 2532 communed with 3656 5707 him 846. 

24:27 But 1161 after 4137 5685 two years 1333 Porcius 4201 Festus 5347 came 2983 5627 into Felix 5344' room 1240: and 5037 Felix 5344, willing 2309 5723 to shew 2698 5641 the Jews 2453 a pleasure 5485, left 2641 5627 Paul 3972 bound 1210 5772. 

25:1 Now 3767 when Festus 5347 was come 1910 5631 into the province 1885, after 3326 three 5140 days 2250 he ascended 305 5627 from 575 Caesarea 2542 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414. 

25:2 Then 1161 the high priest 749 and 2532 the chief 4413 of the Jews 2453 informed him 1718 5656 against 2596 Paul 3972, and 2532 besought 3870 5707 him 846, 

25:3 And desired 154 5734 favour 5485 against 2596 him 846, that 3704 he would send for 3343 5667 him 846 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419, laying 4160 5723 wait 1747 in 2596 the way 3598 to kill 337 5629 him 846. 

25:4 But 3303 3767 Festus 5347 answered 611 5662, that Paul 3972 should be kept 5083 5745 at 1722 Caesarea 2542, and 1161 that he himself 1438 would 3195 5721 depart 1607 5738 1722 shortly 5034 [thither]. 

25:5 Let them therefore 3767, said 5346 5748 he, which among 1722 you 5213 are able 1415, go down with 4782 5631 [me], and accuse 2723 5720 this 846 man 435, if 1536 0 there be 2076 5748 any 1536 wickedness in 1722 him 5129. 

25:6 And 1161 when he had tarried 1304 5660 among 1722 them 846 more 4119 than 2228 ten 1176 days 2250, he went down 2597 5631 unto 1519 Caesarea 2542; and the next day 1887 sitting 2523 5660 on 1909 the judgment seat 968 commanded 2753 5656 Paul 3972 to be brought 71 5683. 

25:7 And 1161 when he 846 was come 3854 5637, the Jews 2453 which came down 2597 5761 from 575 Jerusalem 2414 stood round about 4026 5627, and 2532 laid 5342 5723 many 4183 and grievous 926 complaints 157 against 2596 Paul 3972, which 3739 they could 2480 5707 not 3756 prove 584 5658. 

25:8 While he answered 626 5740 for himself 846, Neither 3754 3777 against 1519 the law 3551 of the Jews 2453, neither 3777 against 1519 the temple 2411, nor yet 3777 against 1519 Caesar 2541, have I offended 264 5627 any thing at all 5100. 

25:9 But 1161 Festus 5347, willing 2309 5723 to do 2698 5641 the Jews 2453 a pleasure 5485, answered 611 5679 Paul 3972, and said 2036 5627, Wilt thou 2309 5719 go up 305 5631 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414, and there 1563 be judged 2919 5745 of 4012 these things 5130 before 1909 me 1700? 

25:10 Then 1161 said 2036 5627 Paul 3972, I stand 1510 5748 2476 5761 at 1909 Caesar's 2541 judgment seat 968, where 3757 I 3165 ought 1163 5748 to be judged 2919 5745: to the Jews 2453 have I done 91 0 no 3762 wrong 91 5656, as 5613 2532 thou 4771 very well 2566 2573 knowest 1921 5719. 

25:11 For 1063 if 1487 3303 I be an offender 91 5719, or 2532 have committed 4238 5758 any thing 5100 worthy 514 of death 2288, I refuse 3868 5736 not 3756 to die 599 5629: but 1161 if 1487 there be 2076 5748 none 3762 of these things whereof these 3778 accuse 2723 5719 me 3450, no man 3762 may 1410 5736 deliver 5483 5664 me 3165 unto them 846. I appeal unto 1941 5731 Caesar 2541. 

25:12 Then 5119 Festus 5347, when he had conferred 4814 5660 with 3326 the council 4824, answered 611 5662, Hast thou appealed unto 1941 5764 Caesar 2541? unto 1909 Caesar 2541 shalt thou go 4198 5695. 

25:13 And 1161 after 1230 5637 certain 5100 days 2250 king 935 Agrippa 67 and 2532 Bernice 959 came 2658 5656 unto 1519 Caesarea 2542 to salute 782 5697 Festus 5347. 

25:14 And 1161 when 5613 they had been 1304 5707 there 1563 many 4119 days 2250, Festus 5347 declared 394 5639 Paul's 3972 cause 2596 unto the king 935, saying 3004 5723, There is 2076 5748 a certain 5100 man 435 left 2641 5772 in bonds 1198 by 5259 Felix 5344: 

25:15 About 4012 whom 3739, when 1096 0 I 3450 was 1096 5637 at 1519 Jerusalem 2414, the chief priests 749 and 2532 the elders 4245 of the Jews 2453 informed 1718 5656 [me], desiring 154 5734 [to have] judgment 1349 against 2596 him 846. 

25:16 To 4314 whom 3739 I answered 611 5662, 3754 It is 2076 5748 not 3756 the manner 1485 of the Romans 4514 to deliver 5483 5738 any 5100 man 444 to 1519 die 684, before 4250 that 2228 he which is accused 2723 5746 have 2192 5722 the accusers 2725 face to face 2596 4383, and have 2983 5630 licence 5117 to answer for himself 627 concerning 4012 the crime laid against him 1462. 

25:17 Therefore 3767, when they 846 were come 4905 5631 hither 1759, without 4160 5671 any 3367 delay 311 on the morrow 1836 I sat 2523 5660 on 1909 the judgment seat 968, and commanded 2753 5656 the man 435 to be brought forth 71 5683. 

25:18 Against 4012 whom 3739 when the accusers 2725 stood up 2476 5685, they brought 2018 5707 none 3762 accusation 156 of such things as 3739 I 1473 supposed 5282 5707: 

25:19 But 1161 had 2192 5707 certain 5100 questions 2213 against 4314 him 846 of 4012 their own 2398 superstition 1175, and 2532 of 4012 one 5100 Jesus 2424, which was dead 2348 5761, whom 3739 Paul 3972 affirmed 5335 5707 to be alive 2198 5721. 

25:20 And 1161 because I 1473 doubted 639 5734 of 1519 such 5127 manner 4012 of questions 2214, I asked 3004 5707 [him] whether 1487 he would 1014 5739 go 4198 5738 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419, and there 2546 be judged 2919 5745 of 4012 these matters 5130. 

25:21 But 1161 when Paul 3972 had appealed 1941 5671 to be reserved 5083 5683 846 unto 1519 the hearing 1233 of Augustus 4575, I commanded 2753 5656 him 848 to be kept 5083 5745 till 2193 I might send 3992 5661 him 846 to 4314 Caesar 2541. 

25:22 Then 1161 Agrippa 67 said 5346 5713 unto 4314 Festus 5347, I would 1014 5711 also 2532 hear 191 5658 the man 444 myself 846. To morrow 839, 1161 said 5346 5748 he, thou shalt hear 191 5695 him 846. 

25:23 And on the morrow 1887, when 3767 Agrippa 67 was come 2064 5631, and 2532 Bernice 959, with 3326 great 4183 pomp 5325, and 2532 was entered 1525 5631 into 1519 the place of hearing 201, with 4862 5037 the chief captains 5506, and 2532 principal 1851 men 435 of 5607 5752 the city 4172 2596, at 2532 Festus 5347' commandment 2753 5660 Paul 3972 was brought forth 71 5681. 

25:24 And 2532 Festus 5347 said 5346 5748, King 935 Agrippa 67, and 2532 all 3956 men 435 which 3588 are here present 4840 5752 with us 2254, ye see 2334 5719 5720 this man 5126, about 4012 whom 3739 all 3956 the multitude 4128 of the Jews 2453 have dealt 1793 5627 with me 3427, both 5037 at 1722 Jerusalem 2414, and 2532 [also] here 1759, crying 1916 5723 that he ought 1163 5750 not 3361 to live 2198 5721 any longer 3371. 

25:25 But 1161 when I 1473 found 2638 5642 that he had committed 4238 5760 nothing 3367 worthy 514 of death 2288, and 2532 1161 that he himself 846 hath appealed 5127 to 1941 5671 Augustus 4575, I have determined 2919 5656 to send 3992 5721 him 846. 

25:26 Of 4012 whom 3739 I have 2192 5719 no 3756 certain 804 thing 5100 to write 1125 5658 unto my lord 2962. Wherefore 1352 I have brought 4254 0 him 846 forth 4254 5627 before 1909 you 5216, and 2532 specially 3122 before 1909 thee 4675, O king 935 Agrippa 67, that 3704, after examination 351 had 1096 5637, I might have 2192 5632 somewhat 5100 to write 1125 5658. 

25:27 For 1063 it seemeth 1380 5719 to me 3427 unreasonable 249 to send 3992 5723 a prisoner 1198, and 2532 not withal 3361 to signify 4591 5658 the crimes 156 [laid] against 2596 him 846. 

26:1 Then 1161 Agrippa 67 said 5346 5713 unto 4314 Paul 3972, Thou 4671 art permitted 2010 5743 to speak 3004 5721 for 5228 thyself 4572. Then 5119 Paul 3972 stretched forth 1614 5660 the hand 5495, and answered for himself 626 5711: 

26:2 I think 2233 5766 myself 1683 happy 3107, king 935 Agrippa 67, because I shall 3195 5723 answer for myself 626 5738 this day 4594 before 1909 thee 4675 touching 4012 all the things 3956 whereof 3739 I am accused 1458 5743 of 5259 the Jews 2453: 

26:3 Especially 3122 [because I know 1492 5761] thee 4571 to be 5607 5752 expert 1109 5037 in all 3956 customs 1485 and 2532 questions 2213 which are among 2596 the Jews 2453: wherefore 1352 I beseech 1189 5736 thee 4675 to hear 191 5658 me 3450 patiently 3116. 

26:4 My 3450 manner 3303 3767 of life 981 from 1537 my youth 3503, which 3588 was 1096 5637 at 575 the first 746 among 1722 mine 3450 own nation 1484 at 1722 Jerusalem 2414, know 2467 5758 all 3956 the Jews 2453; 

26:5 Which knew 4267 5723 me 3165 from the beginning 509, if 1437 they would 2309 5725 testify 3140 5721, that 3754 after 2596 the most straitest 196 sect 139 of our 2251 religion 2356 I lived 2198 5656 a Pharisee 5330. 

26:6 And 2532 now 3568 I stand 2476 5758 and am judged 2919 5746 for 1909 the hope 1680 of the promise 1860 made 1096 5637 of 5259 God 2316 unto 4314 our fathers 3962: 

26:7 Unto 1519 which 3739 [promise] our 2257 twelve tribes 1429, instantly 1722 1616 serving 3000 5723 [God] day 2250 and 2532 night 3571, hope 1679 5719 to come 2658 5658. For 4012 which 3739 hope's sake 1680, king 935 Agrippa 67, I am accused 1458 5743 of 5259 the Jews 2453. 

26:8 Why 5101 should it be thought a thing 2919 5743 incredible 571 with 3844 you 5213, that 1487 God 2316 should raise 1453 5719 the dead 3498? 

26:9 I 1473 verily 3303 3767 thought 1380 5656 with myself 1683, that I ought 1163 5750 to do 4238 5658 many things 4183 contrary 1727 to 4314 the name 3686 of Jesus 2424 of Nazareth 3480. 

26:10 Which thing 3739 I 4160 0 also 2532 did 4160 5656 in 1722 Jerusalem 2414: and 2532 many 4183 of the saints 40 did 2623 0 I 1473 shut up 2623 5656 in prison 5438, having received 2983 5631 authority 1849 from 3844 the chief priests 749; and 5037 when they 846 were put to death 337 5746, I gave 2702 5656 my voice 5586 against [them]. 

26:11 And 2532 I punished 5097 5723 them 846 oft 4178 in 2596 every 3956 synagogue 4864, and compelled 315 5707 [them] to blaspheme 987 5721; and 5037 being 1693 0 exceedingly 4057 mad against 1693 5740 them 846, I persecuted 1377 5707 [them] even 2532 unto 1519 2193 strange 1854 cities 4172. 

26:12 2532 Whereupon 1722 3739 as I went 4198 5740 to 1519 Damascus 1154 with 3326 authority 1849 and 2532 commission 2011 from 3844 the chief priests 749, 

26:13 At midday 2250 3319, O king 935, I saw 1492 5627 in 2596 the way 3598 a light 5457 from heaven 3771, above 5228 the brightness 2987 of the sun 2246, shining round about 4034 5660 me 3165 and 2532 them which journeyed 4198 5740 with 4862 me 1698. 

26:14 And 1161 when we 2257 were 2667 0 all 3956 fallen 2667 5631 to 1519 the earth 1093, I heard 191 5656 a voice 5456 speaking 2980 5723 unto 4314 me 3165, and 2532 saying 3004 5723 in the Hebrew 1446 tongue 1258, Saul 4549, Saul 4549, why 5101 persecutest thou 1377 5719 me 3165? [it is] hard 4642 for thee 4671 to kick 2979 5721 against 4314 the pricks 2759. 

26:15 And 1161 I 1473 said 2036 5627, Who 5101 art thou 1488 5748, Lord 2962? And 1161 he said 2036 5627, I 1473 am 1510 5748 Jesus 2424 whom 3739 thou 4771 persecutest 1377 5719. 

26:16 But 235 rise 450 5628, and 2532 stand 2476 5628 upon 1909 thy 4675 feet 4228: for 1063 I have appeared 3700 5681 unto thee 4671 for 1519 this purpose 5124, to make 4400 5664 thee 4571 a minister 5257 and 2532 a witness 3144 both 5037 of these things which 3739 thou hast seen 1492 5627, and 5037 of those things in the which 3739 I will appear 3700 5701 unto thee 4671; 

26:17 Delivering 1807 5734 thee 4571 from 1537 the people 2992, and 2532 [from] the Gentiles 1484, unto 1519 whom 3739 now 3568 I send 649 5719 thee 4571, 

26:18 To open 455 5658 their 846 eyes 3788, [and] to turn 1994 5658 [them] from 575 darkness 4655 to 1519 light 5457, and 2532 [from] the power 1849 of Satan 4567 unto 1909 God 2316, that they 846 may receive 2983 5629 forgiveness 859 of sins 266, and 2532 inheritance 2819 among 1722 them which are sanctified 37 5772 by faith 4102 that is in 1519 me 1691. 

26:19 Whereupon 3606, O king 935 Agrippa 67, I was 1096 5633 not 3756 disobedient 545 unto the heavenly 3770 vision 3701: 

26:20 But 235 shewed 518 5723 5625 518 5707 first 4412 unto them of 1722 Damascus 1154, and 2532 at Jerusalem 2414, and 5037 throughout 1519 all 3956 the coasts 5561 of Judaea 2449, and 2532 [then] to the Gentiles 1484, that they should repent 3340 5721 and 2532 turn 1994 5721 to 1909 God 2316, and do 4238 5723 works 2041 meet 514 for repentance 3341. 

26:21 For 1752 these causes 5130 the Jews 2453 caught 4815 5642 me 3165 in 1722 the temple 2411, and went about 3987 5711 to kill 1315 5670 [me]. 

26:22 Having 5177 0 therefore 3767 obtained 5177 5631 help 1947 of 3844 God 2316, I continue 2476 5758 unto 891 this 5026 day 2250, witnessing 3140 5746 both 5037 to small 3398 and 2532 great 3173, saying 3004 5723 none other things 3762 than 1622 those which 3739 5037 the prophets 4396 and 2532 Moses 3475 did say 2980 5656 should 3195 5723 come 1096 5738: 

26:23 That 1487 Christ 5547 should suffer 3805, [and] that 1487 he should be the first 4413 that 1537 should 3195 5719 rise 386 from the dead 3498, and should shew 2605 5721 light 5457 unto the people 2992, and 2532 to the Gentiles 1484. 

26:24 And 1161 as he 846 thus 5023 spake for himself 626 5740, Festus 5347 said 5346 5713 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, Paul 3972, thou art beside thyself 3105 5736; much 4183 learning 1121 doth make 4062 5719 thee 4571 mad 1519 3130. 

26:25 But 1161 he said 5346 5748, I am 3105 0 not 3756 mad 3105 5736, most noble 2903 Festus 5347; but 235 speak forth 669 5736 the words 4487 of truth 225 and 2532 soberness 4997. 

26:26 For 1063 the king 935 knoweth 1987 5736 of 4012 these 5130 things, before 4314 whom 3739 also 2532 I speak 2980 5719 freely 3955 5740: for 1063 I am persuaded 3982 5743 that 3756 none 5100 3762 of these things 5130 are hidden 2990 5721 from him 846; for 1063 this thing 5124 was 2076 5748 not 3756 done 4238 5772 in 1722 a corner 1137. 

26:27 King 935 Agrippa 67, believest thou 4100 5719 the prophets 4396? I know 1492 5758 that 3754 thou believest 4100 5719. 

26:28 Then 1161 Agrippa 67 said 5346 5713 unto 4314 Paul 3972, Almost 1722 3641 thou persuadest 3982 5719 me 3165 to be 1096 5635 a Christian 5546. 

26:29 And 1161 Paul 3972 said 2036 5627, I would 302 2172 5665 to God 2316, that not 3756 only 3440 thou 4571, but 235 also 2532 all 3956 that hear 191 5723 me 3450 this day 4594, were 1096 5635 both 2532 almost 1722 3641, and 2532 altogether 4183 such 5108 as 3697 2504 I am 1510 5748, except 3924 these 5130 bonds 1199. 

26:30 And 2532 when he had 2036 0 thus 5023 spoken 2036 5631, the king 935 rose up 450 5627, and 2532 the governor 2232, and 5037 Bernice 959, and 2532 they that sat with 4775 5740 them 846: 

26:31 And 2532 when they were gone aside 402 5660, they talked 2980 5707 between 4314 themselves 240, saying 3004 5723, 3754 This 3778 man 444 doeth 4238 5719 nothing 3762 worthy 514 of death 2288 or 2228 of bonds 1199. 

26:32 Then 1161 said 5346 5713 Agrippa 67 unto Festus 5347, This 3778 man 444 might 1410 5711 have been set at liberty 630 5771, if 1508 0 he had 1941 0 not 1508 appealed unto 1941 5716 Caesar 2541. 

27:1 And 1161 when 5613 it was determined 2919 5681 that we 2248 should sail 636 5721 into 1519 Italy 2482, they delivered 3860 5707 5037 Paul 3972 and 2532 certain 5100 other 2087 prisoners 1202 unto [one] named 3686 Julius 2457, a centurion 1543 of Augustus 4575' band 4686. 

27:2 And 1161 entering 1910 5631 into a ship 4143 of Adramyttium 98, we launched 321 5681, meaning 3195 5723 to sail 4126 5721 by 2596 the coasts 5117 of Asia 773; [one] Aristarchus 708, a Macedonian 3110 of Thessalonica 2331, being 5607 5752 with 4862 us 2254. 

27:3 And 5037 the next 2087 [day] we touched 2609 5648 at 1519 Sidon 4605. And Julius 2457 courteously 5364 entreated 5530 5666 Paul 3972, and gave [him] liberty 2010 5656 to go 4198 5679 unto 4314 his 846 friends 5384 to refresh himself 5177 5629 1958. 

27:4 And 2547 0 when we had launched 321 5685 from thence 2547, we sailed under 5284 5656 Cyprus 2954, because 1223 the winds 417 were 1511 5750 contrary 1727. 

27:5 And 5037 when we had sailed over 1277 5660 the sea 3989 of 2596 Cilicia 2791 and 2532 Pamphylia 3828, we came 2718 5627 to 1519 Myra 3460, [a city] of Lycia 3073. 

27:6 And there 2546 the centurion 1543 found 2147 5631 a ship 4143 of Alexandria 222 sailing 4126 5723 into 1519 Italy 2482; and he put 1688 5656 us 2248 therein 1519 846. 

27:7 And 1161 when we had sailed slowly 1020 5723 1722 many 2425 days 2250, and 2532 scarce 3433 were come 1096 5637 over against 2596 Cnidus 2834, the wind 417 not 3361 suffering 4330 5723 us 2248, we sailed under 5284 5656 Crete 2914, over against 2596 Salmone 4534; 

27:8 And 5037, hardly 3433 passing 3881 5740 it 846, came 2064 5627 unto 1519 a 5100 place 5117 which is called 2564 5746 The fair 2570 havens 2568 3040; nigh 1451 whereunto 3739 was 2258 5713 the city 4172 [of] Lasea 2996. 

27:9 Now 1161 when much 2425 time 5550 was spent 1230 5637, and 2532 when sailing 4144 was 5607 5752 now 2235 dangerous 2000, because 1223 the fast 3521 was 3928 0 now 2532 already 2235 past 3928 5755, Paul 3972 admonished 3867 5707 [them], 

27:10 And said 3004 5723 unto them 846, Sirs 435, I perceive 2334 5719 that 3754 this voyage 4144 will be 3195 5721 1510 5705 with 3326 hurt 5196 and 2532 much 4183 damage 2209, not 3756 only 3440 of the lading 5414 and 2532 ship 4143, but 235 also 2532 of our 2257 lives 5590. 

27:11 Nevertheless 1161 the centurion 1543 believed 3982 5712 the master 2942 and 2532 the owner of the ship 3490, more 3123 than 2228 those things which were spoken 3004 5746 by 5259 Paul 3972. 

27:12 And 1161 because 5225 0 the haven 3040 was 5225 5723 not commodious 428 to 4314 winter in 3915, the more part 4119 advised 1012 5087 5639 to depart 321 5683 thence also 2547, if 1513 by any means 4458 they might 1410 5739 attain 2658 5660 to 1519 Phenice 5405, [and there] to winter 3914 5658; [which is] an haven 3040 of Crete 2914, and lieth 991 5723 toward 2596 the south west 3047 and 2532 2596 north west 5566. 

27:13 And 1161 when the south wind 3558 blew softly 5285 5660, supposing 1380 5660 that they had obtained 2902 5760 [their] purpose 4286, loosing 142 5660 [thence], they sailed 3881 5711 close by 788 Crete 2914. 

27:14 But 1161 not 3756 long 4183 after 3326 there arose 906 5627 against 2596 it 846 a tempestuous 5189 wind 417, called 2564 5746 Euroclydon 2148. 

27:15 And 1161 when the ship 4143 was caught 4884 5685, and 2532 could 1410 5740 not 3361 bear up into 503 5721 the wind 417, we let [her] drive 1929 5631 5342 5712. 

27:16 And 1161 running under 5295 5631 a certain 5100 island 3519 which is called 2564 5746 Clauda 2802, we had 2480 0 much 3433 work 2480 5656 to come by 4031 1096 5635 the boat 4627: 

27:17 Which 3739 when they had taken up 142 5660, they used 5530 5711 helps 996, undergirding 5269 5723 the ship 4143; and 5037, fearing 5399 5740 lest 3361 they should fall 1601 5632 into 1519 the quicksands 4950, strake 5465 5660 sail 4632, and so 3779 were driven 5342 5712. 

27:18 And 1161 we 2257 being exceedingly 4971 tossed with a tempest 5492 5746, the next 1836 [day] they lightened the ship 1546 4160 5710; 

27:19 And 2532 the third 5154 [day] we cast out 4496 5656 with our own hands 849 the tackling 4631 of the ship 4143. 

27:20 And 1161 when neither 3383 sun 2246 nor 3383 stars 798 in 1909 many 4119 days 2250 appeared 2014 5723, and 5037 no 3756 small 3641 tempest 5494 lay on 1945 5740 [us], all 3956 hope 1680 that we 2248 should be saved 4982 5745 was 4014 0 then 3063 taken away 4014 5712. 

27:21 But 1161 after 5225 5723 long 4183 abstinence 776 5119 Paul 3972 stood forth 2476 5685 in 1722 the midst 3319 of them 846, and said 2036 5627, Sirs 5599 435, ye should 1163 5713 3303 have hearkened 3980 5660 unto me 3427, and not 3361 have loosed 321 5745 from 575 Crete 2914, and 5037 to have gained 2770 5658 this 5026 harm 5196 and 2532 loss 2209. 

27:22 And 2532 now 3569 I exhort 3867 5719 you 5209 to be of good cheer 2114 5721: for 1063 there shall be 2071 5704 no 3762 loss 580 of [any man's] life 5590 among 1537 you 5216, but 4133 of the ship 4143. 

27:23 For 1063 there stood by 3936 5627 me 3427 this 5026 night 3571 the angel 32 of God 2316, whose 3739 I am 1510 5748, and 2532 whom 3739 I serve 3000 5719, 

27:24 Saying 3004 5723, Fear 5399 5732 5737 not 3361, Paul 3972; thou 4571 must 1163 5748 be brought before 3936 5629 Caesar 2541: and 2532, lo 2400 5628, God 2316 hath given 5483 5766 thee 4671 all 3956 them that sail 4126 5723 with 3326 thee 4675. 

27:25 Wherefore 1352, sirs 435, be of good cheer 2114 5720: for 1063 I believe 4100 5719 God 2316, that 3754 it shall be 2071 5704 even 2596 3779 as 5158 it was told 2980 5769 me 3427. 

27:26 Howbeit 1161 we 2248 must 1163 5748 be cast 1601 5629 upon 1519 a certain 5100 island 3520. 

27:27 But 1161 when 5613 the fourteenth 5065 night 3571 was come 1096 5633, as we 2257 were driven up and down 1308 5746 in 1722 Adria 99, about 2596 midnight 3319 3571 the shipmen 3492 deemed 5282 5707 that they 848 drew near 4317 5721 to some 5100 country 5561; 

27:28 And 2532 sounded 1001 5660, and found 2147 5627 [it] twenty 1501 fathoms 3712: and 1161 when they had gone 1339 5660 a little further 1024, they sounded 1001 5660 again 3825, and 2532 found 2147 5627 [it] fifteen 1178 fathoms 3712. 

27:29 Then 5037 fearing 5399 5740 lest 3381 4458 we should have fallen 1601 5632 5625 1601 5632 upon 1519 rocks 5117 5138, they cast 4496 5660 four 5064 anchors 45 out of 1537 the stern 4403, and wished 2172 5711 1096 5635 for the day 2250. 

27:30 And 1161 as the shipmen 3492 were about 2212 5723 to flee 5343 5629 out of 1537 the ship 4143, when 2532 they had let down 5465 5660 the boat 4627 into 1519 the sea 2281, under colour 4392 as though 5613 they would 3195 5723 have cast 1614 5721 anchors 45 out of 1537 the foreship 4408, 

27:31 Paul 3972 said 2036 5627 to the centurion 1543 and 2532 to the soldiers 4757, Except 3362 these 3778 abide 3306 5661 in 1722 the ship 4143, ye 5210 cannot 3756 1410 5736 be saved 4982 5683. 

27:32 Then 5119 the soldiers 4757 cut off 609 5656 the ropes 4979 of the boat 4627, and 2532 let 1439 5656 her 846 fall off 1601 5629. 

27:33 And 1161 while 891 3739 the day 2250 was coming 1096 5738 on 3195 5707, Paul 3972 besought 3870 5707 [them] all 537 to take 3335 5629 meat 5160, saying 3004 5723, This day 4594 is the fourteenth 5065 day 2250 that ye have tarried 4328 5723 and continued 1300 5719 fasting 777, having taken 4355 5642 nothing 3367. 

27:34 Wherefore 1352 I pray 3870 5719 you 5209 to take 4355 5629 [some] meat 5160: for 1063 this 5124 is 5225 5719 for 4314 your 5212 health 4991: for 1063 there shall 4098 0 not 3762 0 an hair 2359 fall 4098 5695 from 1537 the head 2776 of any 3762 of you 5216. 

27:35 And 1161 when he had thus 5023 spoken 2036 5631, 2532 he took 2983 5631 bread 740, and gave thanks 2168 5656 to God 2316 in presence 1799 of them all 3956: and 2532 when he had broken 2806 5660 [it], he began 756 5662 to eat 2068 5721. 

27:36 Then 1161 were they 1096 5637 all 3956 of good cheer 2115, and they 4355 0 also 2532 took 4355 5639 [some] meat 5160. 

27:37 And 1161 we were 2258 5713 in all 3956 in 1722 the ship 4143 two hundred 1250 threescore 1440 and sixteen 1803 souls 5590. 

27:38 And 1161 when they had eaten 5160 enough 2880 5685, they lightened 2893 5707 the ship 4143, and cast out 1544 5734 the wheat 4621 into 1519 the sea 2281. 

27:39 And 1161 when 3753 it was 1096 5633 day 2250, they knew 1921 5707 not 3756 the land 1093: but 1161 they discovered 2657 5707 a certain 5100 creek 2859 with 2192 5723 a shore 123, into 1519 the which 3739 they were minded 1011 5662, if 1487 it were possible 1410 5739, to thrust in 1856 5658 the ship 4143. 

27:40 And 2532 when they had taken up 4014 5631 the anchors 45, they committed 1439 5707 [themselves] unto 1519 the sea 2281, and 260 loosed 447 5631 the rudder 4079 bands 2202, and 2532 hoised up 1869 5660 the mainsail 736 to the wind 4154 5723, and made 2722 5707 toward 1519 shore 123. 

27:41 And 1161 falling 4045 5631 into 1519 a place 5117 where two seas met 1337, they ran 2027 0 the ship 3491 aground 2027 5656; and 2532 the forepart 4408 3303 stuck fast 2043 5660, and remained 3306 5656 unmoveable 761, but 1161 the hinder part 4403 was broken 3089 5712 with 5259 the violence 970 of the waves 2949. 

27:42 And 1161 the soldiers 4757' counsel 1012 was 1096 5633 to 2443 kill 615 5725 the prisoners 1202, lest 3361 any of them 5100 should swim out 1579 5660, and escape 1309 5630. 

27:43 But 1161 the centurion 1543, willing 1014 5740 to save 1295 5658 Paul 3972, kept 2967 5656 them 846 from [their] purpose 1013; and 5037 commanded 2753 5656 that they which could 1410 5740 swim 2860 5721 should cast 641 5660 [themselves] first 4413 [into the sea], and get 1826 5750 to 1909 land 1093: 

27:44 And 2532 the rest 3062, some 3739 3303 on 1909 boards 4548, and 1161 some on 1909 [broken pieces] of 575 the ship 4143 5100. And 2532 so 3779 it came to pass 1096 5633, that they escaped 1295 0 all 3956 safe 1295 5683 to 1909 land 1093. 

28:1 And 2532 when they were escaped 1295 5685, then 5119 they knew 1921 5627 that 3754 the island 3520 was called 2564 5743 Melita 3194. 

28:2 And 1161 the barbarous people 915 shewed 3930 5707 us 2254 no 3756 little 5177 5631 kindness 5363: for 1063 they kindled 381 5660 a fire 4443, and received 4355 5639 us 2248 every one 3956, because 1223 of the present 2186 5761 rain 5205, and 2532 because 1223 of the cold 5592. 

28:3 And 1161 when Paul 3972 had gathered 4962 5660 a bundle 4128 of sticks 5434, and 2532 laid 2007 5631 [them] on 1909 the fire 4443, there came 1831 5631 a viper 2191 out of 1537 the heat 2329, and fastened on 2510 5656 his 846 hand 5495. 

28:4 And 1161 when 5613 the barbarians 915 saw 1492 5627 the [venomous] beast 2342 hang 2910 5734 on 1537 his 846 hand 5495, they said 3004 5707 among 4314 themselves 240, No doubt 3843 this 3778 man 444 is 2076 5748 a murderer 5406, whom 3739, though he hath escaped 1295 5685 1537 the sea 2281, yet vengeance 1349 suffereth 1439 5656 not 3756 to live 2198 5721. 

28:5 And 3303 3767 he shook off 660 5660 the beast 2342 into 1519 the fire 4442, and felt 3958 5627 no 3762 harm 2556. 

28:6 Howbeit 1161 they looked 4328 5707 when he 846 should 3195 5721 have swollen 4092 5745, or 2228 fallen down 2667 5721 dead 3498 suddenly 869: but 1161 after they had looked 4328 5723 a great while 1909 4183, and 2532 saw 2334 5723 no 3367 harm 824 come 1096 5740 to 1519 him 846, they changed their minds 3328 5734, and said 3004 5707 that he 846 was 1511 5750 a god 2316. 

28:7 1161 In 1722 4012 the same 1565 quarters 5117 were 5225 5707 possessions 5564 of the chief man 4413 of the island 3520, whose name was 3686 Publius 4196; who 3739 received 324 5666 us 2248, and lodged us 3579 5656 three 5140 days 2250 courteously 5390. 

28:8 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, that the father 3962 of Publius 4196 lay 2621 5738 sick of 4912 5746 a fever 4446 and 2532 of a bloody flux 1420: to 4314 whom 3739 Paul 3972 entered in 1525 5631, and 2532 prayed 4336 5666, and laid 2007 0 his hands 5495 on 2007 5631 him 846, and healed 2390 5662 him 846. 

28:9 So 3767 when 1096 0 this 5127 was done 1096 5637, others 3062 also 2532, which 3588 had 2192 5723 diseases 769 in 1722 the island 3520, came 4334 5711, and 2532 were healed 2323 5712: 

28:10 Who 3739 also 2532 honoured 5092 us 2248 with many 4183 honours 5091 5656; and 2532 when we departed 321 5746, they laded 2007 5639 [us] with such things as 4314 were necessary 5532. 

28:11 And 1161 after 3326 three 5140 months 3376 we departed 321 5681 in 1722 a ship 4143 of Alexandria 222, which had wintered 3914 5761 in 1722 the isle 3520, whose sign 3902 was Castor and Pollux 1359. 

28:12 And 2532 landing 2609 5685 at 1519 Syracuse 4946, we tarried 1961 5656 [there] three 5140 days 2250. 

28:13 And from thence 3606 we fetched a compass 4022 5631, and came 2658 5656 to 1519 Rhegium 4484: and 2532 after 3326 one 3391 day 2250 the south wind 3558 blew 1920 5637, and we came 2064 5627 the next day 1206 to 1519 Puteoli 4223: 

28:14 Where 3757 we found 2147 5631 brethren 80, and were desired 3870 5681 to tarry 1961 5658 with 1909 them 846 seven 2033 days 2250: and 2532 so 3779 we went 2064 5627 toward 1519 Rome 4516. 

28:15 And from thence 2547, when the brethren 80 heard 191 5660 of 4012 us 2257, they came 1831 5627 to meet 529 1519 us 2254 as far as 891 Appii 675 forum 5410, and 2532 The three 5140 taverns 4999: whom 3739 when Paul 3972 saw 1492 5631, he thanked 2168 5660 God 2316, and took 2983 5627 courage 2294. 

28:16 And 1161 when 3753 we came 2064 5627 to 1519 Rome 4516, the centurion 1543 delivered 3860 5656 the prisoners 1198 to the captain of the guard 4759: but 1161 Paul 3972 was suffered 2010 5681 to dwell 3306 5721 by 2596 himself 1438 with 4862 a soldier 4757 that kept 5442 5723 him 846. 

28:17 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, that after 3326 three 5140 days 2250 Paul 3972 called 4779 0 the chief 4413 5607 5752 of the Jews 2453 together 4779 5670: and 1161 when they 846 were come together 4905 5631, he said 3004 5707 unto 4314 them 846, Men 435 [and] brethren 80, though I 1473 have committed 4160 5660 nothing 3762 against 1727 the people 2992, or 2228 customs 1485 of our fathers 3971, yet was I delivered 3860 5681 prisoner 1198 from 1537 Jerusalem 2414 into 1519 the hands 5495 of the Romans 4514. 

28:18 Who 3748, when they had examined 350 5660 me 3165, would 1014 5711 have let [me] go 630 5658, because 1223 there was 5225 5721 no 3367 cause 156 of death 2288 in 1722 me 1698. 

28:19 But 1161 when the Jews 2453 spake against 483 5723 [it], I was constrained 315 5681 to appeal 1941 5670 unto Caesar 2541; not 3756 that 5613 I had 2192 5723 ought 5100 to accuse 2723 0 my 3450 nation 1484 of 2723 5658. 

28:20 For 1223 this 5026 cause 156 therefore 3767 have I called 3870 5656 for you 5209, to see 1492 5629 [you], and 2532 to speak with 4354 5658 [you]: because that 1752 for 1063 the hope 1680 of Israel 2474 I am bound with 4029 5736 this 5026 chain 254. 

28:21 And 1161 they said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, We 2249 neither 3777 received 1209 5662 letters 1121 out of 575 Judaea 2449 concerning 4012 thee 4675, neither 3777 any 5100 of the brethren 80 that came 3854 5637 shewed 518 5656 or 2228 spake 2980 5656 any 5100 harm 4190 of 4012 thee 4675. 

28:22 But 1161 we desire 515 5719 to hear 191 5658 of 3844 thee 4675 what 3739 thou thinkest 5426 5719: for 1063 as concerning 4012 3303 this 5026 sect 139, we 2254 know 2076 5748 1110 that 3754 every where 3837 it is spoken against 483 5743. 

28:23 And 1161 when they had appointed 5021 5671 him 846 a day 2250, there came 2240 5707 many 4119 to 4314 him 846 into 1519 [his] lodging 3578; to whom 3739 he expounded 1620 5710 and testified 1263 5740 the kingdom 932 of God 2316, persuading 3982 5723 them 846 concerning 4012 Jesus 2424, both 5037 out of 575 the law 3551 of Moses 3475, and 2532 [out of] the prophets 4396, from 575 morning 4404 till 2193 evening 2073. 

28:24 And 2532 some 3303 believed 3982 5712 the things which were spoken 3004 5746, and 1161 some believed not 569 5707. 

28:25 And 1161 when they agreed not 800 5607 5752 among 4314 themselves 240, they departed 630 5710, after that Paul 3972 had spoken 2036 5631 one 1520 word 4487, 3754 Well 2573 spake 2980 5656 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 by 1223 Esaias 2268 the prophet 4396 unto 4314 our 2257 fathers 3962, 

28:26 Saying 3004 5723, Go 4198 5676 unto 4314 this 5126 people 2992, and 2532 say 2036 5628, Hearing 189 ye shall hear 191 5692, and 2532 shall 4920 0 not 3364 understand 4920 5655; and 2532 seeing 991 5723 ye shall see 991 5692, and 2532 not 3364 perceive 1492 5632: 

28:27 For 1063 the heart 2588 of this 5127 people 2992 is waxed gross 3975 5681, and 2532 their 846 ears 3775 are dull 917 of hearing 191 5656, and 2532 their 848 eyes 3788 have they closed 2576 5656; lest 3379 4218 they should see 1492 5632 with [their] eyes 3788, and 2532 hear 191 5661 with [their] ears 3775, and 2532 understand 4920 5632 with [their] heart 2588, and 2532 should be converted 1994 5661, and 2532 I should heal 2390 5667 them 846. 

28:28 Be it 2077 5749 known 1110 therefore 3767 unto you 5213, that 3754 the salvation 4992 of God 2316 is sent 649 5648 unto the Gentiles 1484, and 2532 [that] they will hear 191 5695 it 846. 

28:29 And 2532 when he had said 2036 5631 these words 5023, the Jews 2453 departed 565 5627, and had 2192 5723 great 4183 reasoning 4803 among 1722 themselves 1438. 

28:30 And 1161 Paul 3972 dwelt 3306 5656 two 1333 0 whole 3650 years 1333 in 1722 his own 2398 hired house 3410, and 2532 received 588 5711 all 3956 that came in 1531 5740 5734 unto 4314 him 846, 

28:31 Preaching 2784 5723 the kingdom 932 of God 2316, and 2532 teaching 1321 5723 those things which concern 4012 the Lord 2962 Jesus 2424 Christ 5547, with 3326 all 3956 confidence 3954, no man forbidding him 209.
