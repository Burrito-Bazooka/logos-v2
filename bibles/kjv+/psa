1:1 Blessed 835 [is] the man 376 that walketh 1980-1 not in the counsel 6098 of the ungodly, 7563 nor standeth 5975-1 in the way 1870 of sinners, 2400 nor sitteth 3427-1 in the seat 4186 of the scornful. 3887-5

1:2 But his delight 2656 [is] in the law 8451 of the LORD; 3068 and in his law 8451 doth he meditate 1897-4 day 3119 and night. 3915

1:3 And he shall be like a tree 6086 planted 8362-7 by the rivers 6388 of water, 4325 that bringeth forth 5414-4 his fruit 6529 in his season; 6256 his leaf 5929 also shall not wither; 5034-4 and whatsoever he doeth 6213-4 shall prosper. 6743-55

1:4 The ungodly 7563 [are] not so: but [are] like the chaff 4671 which the wind 7307 driveth away. 5086-4

1:5 Therefore the ungodly 7563 shall not stand 6965-4 in the judgment, 4941 nor sinners 2400 in the congregation 5712 of the righteous. 6662

1:6 For the LORD 3068 knoweth 3045-6 the way 1870 of the righteous: 6662 but the way 1870 of the ungodly 7563 shall perish. 6-4

2:1 Why do the heathen 1471 rage, 7283-1 and the people 3816 imagine 1897-4 a vain thing? 7385

2:2 The kings 4428 of the earth 776 set 3320-101 themselves, and the rulers 7336-6 take counsel 3245-8 together, 3162 against the LORD, 3068 and against his anointed, 4899 [saying],

2:3 Let us break 5423-17 their bands 4147 asunder, and cast away 7993-55 their cords 5688 from us.

2:4 He that sitteth 3427-6 in the heavens 8064 shall laugh: 7832-4 the Lord 136 shall have them in derision. 3932-4

2:5 Then shall he speak 1696-17 unto them in his wrath, 639 and vex 926-17 them in his sore displeasure. 2740

2:6 Yet have I set 5258-1 my king 4428 upon my holy 6944 hill 2022 of Zion. 6726

2:7 I will declare 5608-17 the decree: 2706 the LORD 3068 hath said 559-1 unto me, Thou [art] my Son; 1121 this day 3117 have I begotten 3205-1 thee.

2:8 Ask 7592-3 of me, and I shall give 5414-4 [thee] the heathen 1471 [for] thine inheritance, 5159 and the uttermost parts 657 of the earth 776 [for] thy possession. 272

2:9 Thou shalt break 7489-4 them with a rod 7626 of iron; 1270 thou shalt dash them in pieces 5310-17 like a potter's 3335-6 vessel. 3627

2:10 Be wise 7919-54 now therefore, O ye kings: 4428 be instructed, 3256-10 ye judges 8199-6 of the earth. 776

2:11 Serve 5647-3 the LORD 3068 with fear, 3374 and rejoice 1523-3 with trembling. 7461

2:12 Kiss 5401-16 the Son, 1248 lest he be angry, 599-4 and ye perish 6-4 [from] the way, 1870 when his wrath 639 is kindled 1197-4 but a little. 4592 Blessed 835 [are] all they that put their trust 2620-6 in him.

3:1 <A Psalm 4210 of David, 1732 when he fled 1272-2 from 6440 Absalom 53 his son.> 1121 LORD, 3068 how are they increased 7231-1 that trouble 6862 me! many 7227 [are] they that rise up 6965-5 against me.

3:2 Many 7227 [there be] which say 559-6 of my soul, 5315 [There is] no help 3444 for him in God. 430 Selah. 5542

3:3 But thou, O LORD, 3068 [art] a shield 4043 for me; my glory, 3519 and the lifter up 7311-56 of mine head. 7218

3:4 I cried 7121-4 unto the LORD 3068 with my voice, 6963 and he heard 6030-4 me out of his holy 6944 hill. 2022 Selah. 5542

3:5 I laid me down 7901-1 and slept; 3462-4 I awaked; 6974-52 for the LORD 3068 sustained 5564-4 me.

3:6 I will not be afraid 3372-4 of ten thousands 7233 of people, 5971 that have set 7896-1 [themselves] against me round about. 5439

3:7 Arise, 6965-3 O LORD; 3068 save 3467-54 me, O my God: 430 for thou hast smitten 5221-52 all mine enemies 341-6 [upon] the cheek bone; 3895 thou hast broken 7665-14 the teeth 8127 of the ungodly. 7563

3:8 Salvation 3444 [belongeth] unto the LORD: 3068 thy blessing 1293 [is] upon thy people. 5971 Selah. 5542

4:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 on Neginoth, 5058 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 Hear 6030-3 me when I call, 7121-2 O God 430 of my righteousness: 6664 thou hast enlarged 7337-52 me [when I was] in distress; 6862 have mercy 2603-3 upon me, and hear 8085-3 my prayer. 8605

4:2 O ye sons 1121 of men, 376 how long 5704 [will ye turn] my glory 3519 into shame? 3639 [how long] will ye love 157-4 vanity, 7385 [and] seek 1245-17 after leasing? 3577 Selah. 5542

4:3 But know 3045-3 that the LORD 3068 hath set apart 6395-52 him that is godly 2623 for himself: the LORD 3068 will hear 8085-4 when I call 7121-2 unto him.

4:4 Stand in awe, 7264-3 and sin 2398-4 not: commune 559-3 with your own heart 3824 upon your bed, 4904 and be still. 1826-3 Selah. 5542

4:5 Offer 2076-3 the sacrifices 2077 of righteousness, 6664 and put your trust 982-3 in the LORD. 3068

4:6 [There be] many 7227 that say, 559-6 Who will shew 7200-55 us [any] good? 2896 LORD, 3068 lift thou up 5375-3|5254-3 the light 216 of thy countenance 6440 upon us.

4:7 Thou hast put 5414-1 gladness 8057 in my heart, 3820 more than in the time 6256 [that] their corn 1715 and their wine 8492 increased. 7231-1

4:8 I will both 3162 lay me down 7901-4 in peace, 7965 and sleep: 3462-4 for thou, LORD, 3068 only 910 makest me dwell 3427-55 in safety. 983

5:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 upon Nehiloth, 5155 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 Give ear 238-54 to my words, 561 O LORD, 3068 consider 995-3 my meditation. 1901

5:2 Hearken 7181-54 unto the voice 6963 of my cry, 7773 my King, 4428 and my God: 430 for unto thee will I pray. 6419-101

5:3 My voice 6963 shalt thou hear 8085-4 in the morning, 1242 O LORD; 3068 in the morning 1242 will I direct 6186-4 [my prayer] unto thee, and will look up. 6822-17

5:4 For thou [art] not a God 410 that hath pleasure 2655 in wickedness: 7562 neither shall evil 7451 dwell 1481-4 with thee.

5:5 The foolish 1984-6 shall not stand 3320-101 in thy sight: 5869 thou hatest 8130-1 all workers 6466-6 of iniquity. 205

5:6 Thou shalt destroy 6-17 them that speak 1696-6 leasing: 3577 the LORD 3068 will abhor 8581-17 the bloody 1818 and deceitful 4820 man. 376

5:7 But as for me, I will come 935-4 [into] thy house 1004 in the multitude 7230 of thy mercy: 2617 [and] in thy fear 3374 will I worship 7812-101 toward thy holy 6944 temple. 1964

5:8 Lead 5148-3 me, O LORD, 3068 in thy righteousness 6666 because of mine enemies; 8324-6 make thy way 1870 straight 3474-54 before my face. 6440

5:9 For [there is] no faithfulness 3559-12 in their mouth; 6310 their inward 7130 part [is] very wickedness; 1942 their throat 1627 [is] an open 6605-7 sepulchre; 6913 they flatter 2505-55 with their tongue. 3956

5:10 Destroy 816-54 thou them, O God; 430 let them fall 5307-4 by their own counsels; 4156 cast them out 5080-54 in the multitude 7230 of their transgressions; 6588 for they have rebelled 4784-1 against thee.

5:11 But let all those that put their trust 2620-6 in thee rejoice: 8055-4 let them ever 5769 shout for joy, 7442-17 because thou defendest 5526-55 them: let them also that love 157-6 thy name 8034 be joyful 5970-4 in thee.

5:12 For thou, LORD, 3068 wilt bless 1288-17 the righteous; 6662 with favour 7522 wilt thou compass 5849-4 him as [with] a shield. 6793

6:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 on Neginoth 5058 upon Sheminith, 8067|8066 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 O LORD, 3068 rebuke 3198-55 me not in thine anger, 639 neither chasten 3256-17 me in thy hot displeasure. 2534

6:2 Have mercy 2603-3 upon me, O LORD; 3068 for I [am] weak: 536 O LORD, 3068 heal 7495-3 me; for my bones 6106 are vexed. 926-8

6:3 My soul 5315 is also sore 3966 vexed: 926-8 but thou, O LORD, 3068 how long?

6:4 Return, 7725-3 O LORD, 3068 deliver 2502-16 my soul: 5315 oh save 3467-54 me for thy mercies' 2617 sake.

6:5 For in death 4194 [there is] no remembrance 2143 of thee: in the grave 7585 who shall give thee thanks? 3034-55

6:6 I am weary 3021-1 with my groaning; 585 all the night 3915 make I my bed 4296 to swim; 7811-55 I water 4529-55 my couch 6210 with my tears. 1832

6:7 Mine eye 5869 is consumed 6244-1 because of grief; 3708 it waxeth old 6275-1 because of all mine enemies. 6887-6

6:8 Depart 5493-3 from me, all ye workers 6466-6 of iniquity; 205 for the LORD 3068 hath heard 8085-1 the voice 6963 of my weeping. 1065

6:9 The LORD 3068 hath heard 8085-1 my supplication; 8467 the LORD 3068 will receive 3947-4 my prayer. 8605

6:10 Let all mine enemies 341-6 be ashamed 954-4 and sore 3966 vexed: 926-11 let them return 7725-4 [and] be ashamed 954-4 suddenly. 7281

7:1 <Shiggaion 7692 of David, 1732 which he sang 7891-1 unto the LORD, 3068 concerning the words 1697 of Cush 3568 the Benjamite.> 1121 1145 O LORD 3068 my God, 430 in thee do I put my trust: 2620-1 save 3467-54 me from all them that persecute 7291-6 me, and deliver 5337-54 me:

7:2 Lest he tear 2963-4 my soul 5315 like a lion, 738 rending [it] in pieces, 6561-6 while [there is] none to deliver. 5337-56

7:3 O LORD 3068 my God, 430 if I have done 6213-1 this; if there be 3426 iniquity 5766 in my hands; 3709

7:4 If I have rewarded 1580-1 evil 7451 unto him that was at peace 7999-6 with me; (yea, I have delivered 2502-17 him that without cause 7387 is mine enemy:) 6887-6

7:5 Let the enemy 341-6 persecute 7291-17 my soul, 5315 and take 5381-55 [it]; yea, let him tread down 7429-4 my life 2416 upon the earth, 776 and lay 7931-55 mine honour 3519 in the dust. 6083 Selah. 5542

7:6 Arise, 6965-3 O LORD, 3068 in thine anger, 639 lift up 5375-10 thyself because of the rage 5678 of mine enemies: 6887-6 and awake 5782-3 for me [to] the judgment 4941 [that] thou hast commanded. 6680-14

7:7 So shall the congregation 5712 of the people 3816 compass thee about: 5437-25 for their sakes therefore return 7725-3 thou on high. 4791

7:8 The LORD 3068 shall judge 1777-4 the people: 5971 judge 8199-3 me, O LORD, 3068 according to my righteousness, 6664 and according to mine integrity 8537 [that is] in me.

7:9 Oh let the wickedness 7451 of the wicked 7563 come to an end; 1584-4 but establish 3559-34 the just: 6662 for the righteous 6662 God 430 trieth 974-6 the hearts 3826 and reins. 3629

7:10 My defence 4043 [is] of God, 430 which saveth 3467-56 the upright 3477 in heart. 3820

7:11 God 430 judgeth 8199-6 the righteous, 6662 and God 410 is angry 2194-6 [with the wicked] every day. 3117

7:12 If he turn 7725-4 not, he will whet 3913-4 his sword; 2719 he hath bent 1869-1 his bow, 7198 and made it ready. 3559-34

7:13 He hath also prepared 3559-52 for him the instruments 3627 of death; 4194 he ordaineth 6466-4 his arrows 2671 against the persecutors. 1814-5

7:14 Behold, he travaileth 2254-17 with iniquity, 205 and hath conceived 2029-1 mischief, 5999 and brought forth 3205-1 falsehood. 8267

7:15 He made 3738-1 a pit, 953 and digged 2658-4 it, and is fallen 5307-4 into the ditch 7845 [which] he made. 6466-4

7:16 His mischief 5999 shall return 7725-4 upon his own head, 7218 and his violent 2555 dealing shall come down 3381-4 upon his own pate. 6936

7:17 I will praise 3034-55 the LORD 3068 according to his righteousness: 6664 and will sing praise 2167-17 to the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 most high. 5945

8:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 upon Gittith, 1665 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 O LORD 3068 our Lord, 113 how excellent 117 [is] thy name 8034 in all the earth! 776 who hast set 5414-3 thy glory 1935 above the heavens. 8064

8:2 Out of the mouth 6310 of babes 5768 and sucklings 3243-6 hast thou ordained 3245-14 strength 5797 because of thine enemies, 6887-6 that thou mightest still 7673-53 the enemy 341-6 and the avenger. 5358-102

8:3 When I consider 7200-4 thy heavens, 8064 the work 4639 of thy fingers, 676 the moon 3394 and the stars, 3556 which thou hast ordained; 3559-31

8:4 What is man, 582 that thou art mindful 2142-4 of him? and the son 1121 of man, 120 that thou visitest 6485-4 him?

8:5 For thou hast made him a little 4592 lower 2637-17 than the angels, 430 and hast crowned 5849-17 him with glory 3519 and honour. 1926

8:6 Thou madest him to have dominion 4910-55 over the works 4639 of thy hands; 3027 thou hast put 7896-1 all [things] under his feet: 7272

8:7 All sheep 6792 and oxen, 504 yea, and the beasts 929 of the field; 7704

8:8 The fowl 6833 of the air, 8064 and the fish 1709 of the sea, 3220 [and whatsoever] passeth through 5674-6 the paths 734 of the seas. 3220

8:9 O LORD 3068 our Lord, 113 how excellent 117 [is] thy name 8034 in all the earth! 776

9:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 upon Muthlabben, 4192 1121 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 I will praise 3034-55 [thee], O LORD, 3068 with my whole heart; 3820 I will shew forth 5608-17 all thy marvellous works. 6381-12

9:2 I will be glad 8055-4 and rejoice 5970-4 in thee: I will sing praise 2167-17 to thy name, 8034 O thou most High. 5945

9:3 When mine enemies 341-6 are turned 7725-2 back, 268 they shall fall 3782-11 and perish 6-4 at thy presence. 6440

9:4 For thou hast maintained 6213-1 my right 4941 and my cause; 1779 thou satest 3427-1 in the throne 3678 judging 8199-6 right. 6664

9:5 Thou hast rebuked 1605-1 the heathen, 1471 thou hast destroyed 6-14 the wicked, 7563 thou hast put out 4229-1 their name 8034 for ever 5769 and ever. 5703

9:6 O thou enemy, 341-6 destructions 2723 are come to a perpetual 5331 end: 8552-1 and thou hast destroyed 5428-1 cities; 6145|5892-q their memorial 2143 is perished 6-1 with them. 1992

9:7 But the LORD 3068 shall endure 3427-4 for ever: 5769 he hath prepared 3559-31 his throne 3678 for judgment. 4941

9:8 And he shall judge 8199-4 the world 8398 in righteousness, 6664 he shall minister judgment 1777-4 to the people 3816 in uprightness. 4339

9:9 The LORD 3068 also will be a refuge 4869 for the oppressed, 1790 a refuge 4869 in times 6256 of trouble. 6869

9:10 And they that know 3045-6 thy name 8034 will put their trust 982-4 in thee: for thou, LORD, 3068 hast not forsaken 5800-1 them that seek 1875-6 thee.

9:11 Sing praises 2167-16 to the LORD, 3068 which dwelleth 3427-6 in Zion: 6726 declare 5046-54 among the people 5971 his doings. 5949

9:12 When he maketh inquisition 1875-6 for blood, 1818 he remembereth 2142-1 them: he forgetteth 7911-1 not the cry 6818 of the humble. 6035|6041-k

9:13 Have mercy 2603-3 upon me, O LORD; 3068 consider 7200-3 my trouble 6040 [which I suffer] of them that hate 8130-6 me, thou that liftest me up 7311-35 from the gates 8179 of death: 4194

9:14 That I may shew forth 5608-17 all thy praise 8416 in the gates 8179 of the daughter 1323 of Zion: 6726 I will rejoice 1523-4 in thy salvation. 3444

9:15 The heathen 1471 are sunk 2883-1 down in the pit 7845 [that] they made: 6213-1 in the net 7568 which 2098 they hid 2934-1 is their own foot 7272 taken. 3920-8

9:16 The LORD 3068 is known 3045-8 [by] the judgment 4941 [which] he executeth: 6213-1 the wicked 7563 is snared 5367-1 in the work 6467 of his own hands. 3709 Higgaion. 1902 Selah. 5542

9:17 The wicked 7563 shall be turned 7725-4 into hell, 7585 [and] all the nations 1471 that forget 7913 God. 430

9:18 For the needy 34 shall not alway 5331 be forgotten: 7911-11 the expectation 8615 of the poor 6041|6035-k shall [not] perish 6-4 for ever. 5703

9:19 Arise, 6965-3 O LORD; 3068 let not man 582 prevail: 5810-4 let the heathen 1471 be judged 8199-11 in thy sight. 6440

9:20 Put 7896-3 them in fear, 4172|4172-k O LORD: 3068 [that] the nations 1471 may know 3045-4 themselves [to be but] men. 582 Selah. 5542

10:1 Why standest 5975-4 thou afar off, 7350 O LORD? 3068 [why] hidest 5956-55 thou [thyself] in times 6256 of trouble? 6869

10:2 The wicked 7563 in [his] pride 1346 doth persecute 1814-4 the poor: 6041 let them be taken 8610-11 in the devices 4209 that 2098 they have imagined. 2803-1

10:3 For the wicked 7563 boasteth 1984-14 of his heart's 5315 desire, 8378 and blesseth 1288-14 the covetous, 1214-6 [whom] the LORD 3068 abhorreth. 5006-14

10:4 The wicked, 7563 through the pride 1363 of his countenance, 639 will not seek 1875-4 [after God]: God 430 [is] not in all his thoughts. 4209

10:5 His ways 1870 are always 6256 grievous; 2342-4 thy judgments 4941 [are] far above 4791 out of his sight: [as for] all his enemies, 6887-6 he puffeth 6315-55 at them.

10:6 He hath said 559-1 in his heart, 3820 I shall not be moved: 4131-11 for [I shall] never 1755 1755 [be] in adversity. 7451

10:7 His mouth 6310 is full 4390-1 of cursing 423 and deceit 4820 and fraud: 8496 under his tongue 3956 [is] mischief 5999 and vanity. 205

10:8 He sitteth 3427-4 in the lurking places 3993 of the villages: 2691 in the secret places 4565 doth he murder 2026-4 the innocent: 5355 his eyes 5869 are privily set 6845-4 against the poor. 2489

10:9 He lieth in wait 693-4 secretly 4565 as a lion 738 in his den: 5520 he lieth in wait 693-4 to catch 2414-2 the poor: 6041 he doth catch 2414-4 the poor, 6041 when he draweth 4900-2 him into his net. 7568

10:10 He croucheth, 1794-4 [and] humbleth 7817-4 himself, that the poor 2489|2426-q|2489-q may fall 5307-1 by his strong ones. 6099

10:11 He hath said 559-1 in his heart, 3820 God 410 hath forgotten: 7911-1 he hideth 5641-52 his face; 6440 he will never 1077 5331 see 7200-1 [it].

10:12 Arise, 6965-3 O LORD; 3068 O God, 410 lift up 5375-3 thine hand: 3027 forget 7911-4 not the humble. 6035|6041-k

10:13 Wherefore doth the wicked 7563 contemn 5006-14 God? 430 he hath said 559-1 in his heart, 3820 Thou wilt not require 1875-4 [it].

10:14 Thou hast seen 7200-1 [it]; for thou beholdest 5027-55 mischief 5999 and spite, 3708 to requite 5414-2 [it] with thy hand: 3027 the poor 2489 committeth 5800-4 himself unto thee; thou art the helper 5826-6 of the fatherless. 3490

10:15 Break 7665-3 thou the arm 2220 of the wicked 7563 and the evil 7451 [man]: seek out 1875-4 his wickedness 7562 [till] thou find 4672-4 none. 1077

10:16 The LORD 3068 [is] King 4428 for ever 5769 and ever: 5703 the heathen 1471 are perished 6-1 out of his land. 776

10:17 LORD, 3068 thou hast heard 8085-1 the desire 8378 of the humble: 6035 thou wilt prepare 3559-55 their heart, 3820 thou wilt cause thine ear 241 to hear: 7181-55

10:18 To judge 8199-2 the fatherless 3490 and the oppressed, 1790 that the man 582 of the earth 776 may no more 3254-55 oppress. 6206-2

11:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 [A Psalm] of David.> 1732 In the LORD 3068 put I my trust: 2620-1 how say 559-4 ye to my soul, 5315 Flee 5110-3 [as] a bird 6833 to your mountain? 2022

11:2 For, lo, the wicked 7563 bend 1869-4 [their] bow, 7198 they make ready 3559-31 their arrow 2671 upon the string, 3499 that they may privily 652|1119-q shoot 3384-2 at the upright 3477 in heart. 3820

11:3 If the foundations 8356 be destroyed, 2040-11 what can the righteous 6662 do? 6466-1

11:4 The LORD 3068 [is] in his holy 6944 temple, 1964 the LORD'S 3068 throne 3678 [is] in heaven: 8064 his eyes 5869 behold, 2372-4 his eyelids 6079 try, 974-4 the children 1121 of men. 120

11:5 The LORD 3068 trieth 974-4 the righteous: 6662 but the wicked 7563 and him that loveth 157-6 violence 2555 his soul 5315 hateth. 8130-1

11:6 Upon the wicked 7563 he shall rain 4305-55 snares, 6341 fire 784 and brimstone, 1614 and an horrible 2152 tempest: 7307 [this shall be] the portion 4521 of their cup. 3563

11:7 For the righteous 6662 LORD 3068 loveth 157-1 righteousness; 6666 his countenance 6440 doth behold 2372-4 the upright. 3477

12:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 upon Sheminith, 8067|8066 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 Help, 3467-54 LORD; 3068 for the godly man 2623 ceaseth; 1584-1 for the faithful 539-7 fail 6461-1 from among the children 1121 of men. 120

12:2 They speak 1696-17 vanity 7723 every one 376 with his neighbour: 7453 [with] flattering 2513 lips 8193 [and] with a double 3820 heart 3820 do they speak. 1696-17

12:3 The LORD 3068 shall cut off 3772-55 all flattering 2513 lips, 8193 [and] the tongue 3956 that speaketh 1696-18 proud 1419 things:

12:4 Who have said, 559-1 With our tongue 3956 will we prevail; 1396-55 our lips 8193 [are] our own: who [is] lord 113 over us?

12:5 For the oppression 7701 of the poor, 6041 for the sighing 603 of the needy, 34 now will I arise, 6965-4 saith 559-4 the LORD; 3068 I will set 7896-4 [him] in safety 3468 [from him that] puffeth 6315-55 at him.

12:6 The words 565 of the LORD 3068 [are] pure 2889 words: 565 [as] silver 3701 tried 6884-7 in a furnace 5948 of earth, 776 purified 2212-30 seven times. 7659

12:7 Thou shalt keep 8104-4 them, O LORD, 3068 thou shalt preserve 5341-4 them from this 2098 generation 1755 for ever. 5769

12:8 The wicked 7563 walk 1980-101 on every side, 5439 when the vilest 2149 men 1121 120 are exalted. 7311-2

13:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 How long wilt thou forget 7911-4 me, O LORD? 3068 for ever? 5331 how long wilt thou hide 5641-55 thy face 6440 from me?

13:2 How long shall I take 7896-4 counsel 6098 in my soul, 5315 [having] sorrow 3015 in my heart 3824 daily? 3119 how long shall mine enemy 341-6 be exalted 7311-4 over me?

13:3 Consider 5027-54 [and] hear 6030-3 me, O LORD 3068 my God: 430 lighten 215-54 mine eyes, 5869 lest I sleep 3462-4 the [sleep of] death; 4194

13:4 Lest mine enemy 341-6 say, 559-4 I have prevailed 3201-1 against him; [and] those that trouble 6862 me rejoice 1523-4 when I am moved. 4131-11

13:5 But I have trusted 982-1 in thy mercy; 2617 my heart 3820 shall rejoice 1523-4 in thy salvation. 3444

13:6 I will sing 7891-4 unto the LORD, 3068 because he hath dealt bountifully 1580-1 with me.

14:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 [A Psalm] of David.> 1732 The fool 5036 hath said 559-1 in his heart, 3820 [There is] no God. 430 They are corrupt, 7843-52 they have done abominable 8581-52 works, 5949 [there is] none that doeth 6213-6 good. 2896

14:2 The LORD 3068 looked down 8259-52 from heaven 8064 upon the children 1121 of men, 120 to see 7200-2 if there were 3426 any that did understand, 7919-56 [and] seek 1875-6 God. 430

14:3 They are all gone aside, 5493-1 they are [all] together 3162 become filthy: 444-8 [there is] none that doeth 6213-6 good, 2896 no, not one. 259

14:4 Have all the workers 6466-6 of iniquity 205 no knowledge? 3045-1 who eat up 398-6 my people 5971 [as] they eat 398-1 bread, 3899 and call 7121-1 not upon the LORD. 3068

14:5 There were they in great 6343 fear: 6342-1 for God 430 [is] in the generation 1755 of the righteous. 6662

14:6 Ye have shamed 954-55 the counsel 6098 of the poor, 6041 because the LORD 3068 [is] his refuge. 4268

14:7 Oh that 5414-4 the salvation 3444 of Israel 3478 [were come] out of Zion! 6726 when the LORD 3068 bringeth back 7725-2 the captivity 7622 of his people, 5971 Jacob 3290 shall rejoice, 1523-4 [and] Israel 3478 shall be glad. 8055-4

15:1 <A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 LORD, 3068 who shall abide 1481-4 in thy tabernacle? 168 who shall dwell 7931-4 in thy holy 6944 hill? 2022

15:2 He that walketh 1980-6 uprightly, 8549 and worketh 6466-6 righteousness, 6664 and speaketh 1696-6 the truth 571 in his heart. 3824

15:3 [He that] backbiteth 7270-1 not with his tongue, 3956 nor doeth 6213-1 evil 7451 to his neighbour, 7453 nor taketh up 5375-1 a reproach 2781 against his neighbour. 7138

15:4 In whose eyes 5869 a vile person 3988-12 is contemned; 959-12 but he honoureth 3513-17 them that fear 3373 the LORD. 3068 [He that] sweareth 7650-8 to [his own] hurt, 7489-53 and changeth 4171-55 not.

15:5 [He that] putteth 5414-1 not out his money 3701 to usury, 5392 nor taketh 3947-1 reward 7810 against the innocent. 5355 He that doeth 6213-6 these [things] shall never 3808 5769 be moved. 4131-11

16:1 <Michtam 4387 of David.> 1732 Preserve 8104-3 me, O God: 410 for in thee do I put my trust. 2620-1

16:2 [O my soul], thou hast said 559-1 unto the LORD, 3068 Thou [art] my Lord: 136 my goodness 2896 [extendeth] not to thee;

16:3 [But] to the saints 6918 that [are] in the earth, 776 1992 and [to] the excellent, 117 in whom [is] all my delight. 2656

16:4 Their sorrows 6094 shall be multiplied 7235-4 [that] hasten 4116-1 [after] another 312 [god]: their drink offerings 5262 of blood 1818 will I not 1077 offer, 5258-55 nor 1077 take up 5375-4 their names 8034 into my lips. 8193

16:5 The LORD 3068 [is] the portion 4490 of mine inheritance 2506 and of my cup: 3563 thou maintainest 8551-6 my lot. 1486

16:6 The lines 2256 are fallen 5307-1 unto me in pleasant 5273 [places]; yea, I have a goodly 8231-1 heritage. 5159

16:7 I will bless 1288-17 the LORD, 3068 who hath given me counsel: 3289-1 my reins 3629 also instruct 3256-14 me in the night seasons. 3915

16:8 I have set 7737-14 the LORD 3068 always 8548 before me: because [he is] at my right hand, 3225 I shall not be moved. 4131-11

16:9 Therefore my heart 3820 is glad, 8055-1 and my glory 3519 rejoiceth: 1523-4 my flesh 1320 also shall rest 7931-4 in hope. 983

16:10 For thou wilt not leave 5800-4 my soul 5315 in hell; 7585 neither wilt thou suffer 5414-4 thine Holy One 2623 to see 7200-2 corruption. 7845

16:11 Thou wilt shew 3045-55 me the path 734 of life: 2416 in thy presence 6440 [is] fulness 7648 of joy; 8057 at thy right hand 3225 [there are] pleasures 5273 for evermore. 5331

17:1 <A Prayer 8605 of David.> 1732 Hear 8085-3 the right, 6664 O LORD, 3068 attend 7181-54 unto my cry, 7440 give ear 238-54 unto my prayer, 8605 [that goeth] not 3808 out of feigned 4820 lips. 8193

17:2 Let my sentence 4941 come forth 3318-4 from thy presence; 6440 let thine eyes 5869 behold 2372-4 the things that are equal. 4339

17:3 Thou hast proved 974-1 mine heart; 3820 thou hast visited 6485-1 [me] in the night; 3915 thou hast tried 6884-1 me, [and] shalt find 4672-4 nothing; I am purposed 2161-2 [that] my mouth 6310 shall not transgress. 5674-4

17:4 Concerning the works 6468 of men, 120 by the word 1697 of thy lips 8193 I have kept 8104-1 [me from] the paths 734 of the destroyer. 6530

17:5 Hold up 8551-2 my goings 838 in thy paths, 4570 [that] my footsteps 6471 slip 4131-8 not.

17:6 I have called 7121-1 upon thee, for thou wilt hear 6030-4 me, O God: 410 incline 5186-54 thine ear 241 unto me, [and hear] 8085-3 my speech. 565

17:7 Shew thy marvellous 6395-54 lovingkindness, 2617 O thou that savest 3467-56 by thy right hand 3225 them which put their trust 2620-6 [in thee] from those that rise up 6965-102 [against them].

17:8 Keep 8104-3 me as the apple 380 of the eye, 1323 5869 hide 5641-55 me under the shadow 6738 of thy wings, 3671

17:9 From 6440 the wicked 7563 that 2098 oppress 7703-1 me, [from] my deadly 5315 enemies, 341-6 [who] compass me about. 5362-55

17:10 They are inclosed 5462-1 in their own fat: 2459 with their mouth 6310 they speak 1696-14 proudly. 1348

17:11 They have now compassed 5437-1 us in our steps: 838 they have set 7896-4 their eyes 5869 bowing down 5186-2 to the earth; 776

17:12 Like 1825 as a lion 738 [that] is greedy 3700-4 of his prey, 2963-2 and as it were a young lion 3715 lurking 3427-6 in secret places. 4565

17:13 Arise, 6965-3 O LORD, 3068 disappoint 6923-16 him, 6440 cast him down: 3766-54 deliver 6403-16 my soul 5315 from the wicked, 7563 [which is] thy sword: 2719

17:14 From men 4962 [which are] thy hand, 3027 O LORD, 3068 from men 4962 of the world, 2465 [which have] their portion 2506 in [this] life, 2416 and whose belly 990 thou fillest 4390-17 with thy hid 6845-7|6840-k [treasure]: they are full 7646-4 of children, 1121 and leave 3240-52 the rest 3499 of their [substance] to their babes. 5768

17:15 As for me, I will behold 2372-4 thy face 6440 in righteousness: 6664 I shall be satisfied, 7646-4 when I awake, 6974-53 with thy likeness. 8544

18:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 [A Psalm] of David, 1732 the servant 5650 of the LORD, 3068 who spake 1696-14 unto the LORD 3068 the words 1697 of this song 7892 in the day 3117 [that] the LORD 3068 delivered 5337-52 him from the hand 3709 of all his enemies, 341-6 and from the hand 3027 of Saul: 7586 And he said,> 559-4 I will love 7355-4 thee, O LORD, 3068 my strength. 2391

18:2 The LORD 3068 [is] my rock, 5553 and my fortress, 4686 and my deliverer; 6403-18 my God, 410 my strength, 6697 in whom I will trust; 2620-4 my buckler, 4043 and the horn 7161 of my salvation, 3468 [and] my high tower. 4869

18:3 I will call 7121-4 upon the LORD, 3068 [who is worthy] to be praised: 1984-30 so shall I be saved 3467-11 from mine enemies. 341-6

18:4 The sorrows 2256 of death 4194 compassed 661-1 me, and the floods 5158 of ungodly men 1100 made me afraid. 1204-17

18:5 The sorrows 2256 of hell 7585 compassed me about: 5437-1 the snares 4170 of death 4194 prevented 6923-14 me.

18:6 In my distress 6862 I called 7121-4 upon the LORD, 3068 and cried 7768-17 unto my God: 430 he heard 8085-4 my voice 6963 out of his temple, 1964 and my cry 7775 came 935-4 before 6440 him, [even] into his ears. 241

18:7 Then the earth 776 shook 1607-4 and trembled; 7493-4 the foundations 4144 also of the hills 2022 moved 7264-4 and were shaken, 1607-101 because he was wroth. 2734-1

18:8 There went up 5927-1 a smoke 6227 out of his nostrils, 639 and fire 784 out of his mouth 6310 devoured: 398-4 coals 1513 were kindled 1197-1 by it.

18:9 He bowed 5186-4 the heavens 8064 also, and came down: 3381-4 and darkness 6205 [was] under his feet. 7272

18:10 And he rode 7392-4 upon a cherub, 3742 and did fly: 5774-4 yea, he did fly 1675-4 upon the wings 3671 of the wind. 7307

18:11 He made 7896-4 darkness 2822 his secret place; 5643 his pavilion 5521 round about 5439 him [were] dark 2824 waters 4325 [and] thick clouds 5645 of the skies. 7834

18:12 At the brightness 5051 [that was] before him his thick clouds 5645 passed, 5674-1 hail 1259 [stones] and coals 1513 of fire. 784

18:13 The LORD 3068 also thundered 7481-55 in the heavens, 8064 and the Highest 5945 gave 5414-4 his voice; 6963 hail 1259 [stones] and coals 1513 of fire. 784

18:14 Yea, he sent out 7971-4 his arrows, 2671 and scattered 6327-55 them; and he shot out 7232-1 lightnings, 1300 and discomfited 2000-4 them.

18:15 Then the channels 650 of waters 4325 were seen, 7200-11 and the foundations 4146 of the world 8398 were discovered 1540-11 at thy rebuke, 1606 O LORD, 3068 at the blast 5397 of the breath 7307 of thy nostrils. 639

18:16 He sent 7971-4 from above, 4791 he took 3947-4 me, he drew 4871-55 me out of many 7227 waters. 4325

18:17 He delivered 5337-55 me from my strong 5794 enemy, 341-6 and from them which hated 8130-6 me: for they were too strong 553-1 for me.

18:18 They prevented 6923-17 me in the day 3117 of my calamity: 343 but the LORD 3068 was my stay. 4937

18:19 He brought me forth 3318-55 also into a large place; 4800 he delivered 2502-17 me, because he delighted 2654-1 in me.

18:20 The LORD 3068 rewarded 1580-4 me according to my righteousness; 6664 according to the cleanness 1252 of my hands 3027 hath he recompensed 7725-55 me.

18:21 For I have kept 8104-1 the ways 1870 of the LORD, 3068 and have not wickedly departed 7561-1 from my God. 430

18:22 For all his judgments 4941 [were] before me, and I did not put away 5493-55 his statutes 2708 from me.

18:23 I was also upright 8549 before him, and I kept 8104-101 myself from mine iniquity. 5771

18:24 Therefore hath the LORD 3068 recompensed 7725-55 me according to my righteousness, 6664 according to the cleanness 1252 of my hands 3027 in his eyesight. 5869

18:25 With the merciful 2623 thou wilt shew thyself merciful; 2616-101 with an upright 8549 man 1399 thou wilt shew thyself upright; 8552-101

18:26 With the pure 1305-12 thou wilt shew thyself pure; 1305-101 and with the froward 6141 thou wilt shew thyself froward. 6617-101

18:27 For thou wilt save 3467-55 the afflicted 6041 people; 5971 but wilt bring down 8213-55 high 7311-6 looks. 5869

18:28 For thou wilt light 215-55 my candle: 5216 the LORD 3068 my God 430 will enlighten 5050-55 my darkness. 2822

18:29 For by thee I have run through 7323-4 a troop; 1416 and by my God 430 have I leaped 1801-17 over a wall. 7791

18:30 [As for] God, 410 his way 1870 [is] perfect: 8549 the word 565 of the LORD 3068 is tried: 6884-7 he [is] a buckler 4043 to all those that trust 2620-6 in him.

18:31 For who [is] God 433 save 1107 the LORD? 3068 or who [is] a rock 6697 save 2108 our God? 430

18:32 [It is] God 410 that girdeth 247-18 me with strength, 2428 and maketh 5414-4 my way 1870 perfect. 8549

18:33 He maketh my feet 7272 like 7737-18 hinds' 355 [feet], and setteth 5975-55 me upon my high places. 1116

18:34 He teacheth 3925-18 my hands 3027 to war, 4421 so that a bow 7198 of steel 5154 is broken 5181-14 by mine arms. 2220

18:35 Thou hast also given 5414-4 me the shield 4043 of thy salvation: 3468 and thy right hand 3225 hath holden me up, 5582-4 and thy gentleness 6037 hath made me great. 7235-55

18:36 Thou hast enlarged 7337-55 my steps 6806 under me, that my feet 7166 did not slip. 4571-1

18:37 I have pursued 7291-4 mine enemies, 341-6 and overtaken 5381-55 them: neither did I turn again 7725-4 till they were consumed. 3615-15

18:38 I have wounded 4272-4 them that they were not able 3201-4 to rise: 6965-2 they are fallen 5307-4 under my feet. 7272

18:39 For thou hast girded 247-17 me with strength 2428 unto the battle: 4421 thou hast subdued 3766-55 under me those that rose up 6965-5 against me.

18:40 Thou hast also given 5414-1 me the necks 6203 of mine enemies; 341-6 that I might destroy 6789-55 them that hate 8130-18 me.

18:41 They cried, 7768-17 but [there was] none to save 3467-56 [them: even] unto the LORD, 3068 but he answered 6030-1 them not.

18:42 Then did I beat 7833-4 them small as the dust 6083 before 6440 the wind: 7307 I did cast them out 7324-55 as the dirt 2916 in the streets. 2351

18:43 Thou hast delivered 6403-17 me from the strivings 7379 of the people; 5971 [and] thou hast made 7760-4 me the head 7218 of the heathen: 1471 a people 5971 [whom] I have not known 3045-1 shall serve 5647-4 me.

18:44 As soon as they hear 8088 241 of me, they shall obey 8085-11 me: the strangers 1121 5236 shall submit 3584-17 themselves unto me.

18:45 The strangers 1121 5236 shall fade away, 5034-4 and be afraid 2727-4 out of their close places. 4526

18:46 The LORD 3068 liveth; 2416 and blessed 1288-7 [be] my rock; 6697 and let the God 430 of my salvation 3468 be exalted. 7311-4

18:47 [It is] God 410 that avengeth 5414-6 5360 me, and subdueth 1696-55 the people 5971 under me.

18:48 He delivereth 6403-18 me from mine enemies: 341-6 yea, thou liftest me up 7311-34 above those that rise up 6965-5 against me: thou hast delivered 5337-55 me from the violent 2555 man. 376

18:49 Therefore will I give thanks 3034-55 unto thee, O LORD, 3068 among the heathen, 1471 and sing praises 2167-17 unto thy name. 8034

18:50 Great 1431-56 deliverance 3444 giveth he to his king; 4428 and sheweth 6213-6 mercy 2617 to his anointed, 4899 to David, 1732 and to his seed 2233 for 5704 evermore. 5769

19:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 The heavens 8064 declare 5608-18 the glory 3519 of God; 410 and the firmament 7549 sheweth 5046-56 his handywork. 4639 3027

19:2 Day 3117 unto day 3117 uttereth 5042-55 speech, 562 and night 3915 unto night 3915 sheweth 2331-17 knowledge. 1847

19:3 [There is] no speech 562 nor language, 1697 [where] their voice 6963 is not heard. 8085-8

19:4 Their line 6957 is gone out 3318-1 through all the earth, 776 and their words 4405 to the end 7097 of the world. 8398 In them hath he set 7760-1 a tabernacle 168 for the sun, 8121

19:5 Which [is] as a bridegroom 2860 coming out 3318-6 of his chamber, 2646 [and] rejoiceth 7797-4 as a strong man 1368 to run 7323-2 a race. 734

19:6 His going forth 4161 [is] from the end 7097 of the heaven, 8064 and his circuit 8622 unto the ends 7098 of it: and there is nothing hid 5641-12 from the heat 2535 thereof.

19:7 The law 8451 of the LORD 3068 [is] perfect, 8549 converting 7725-56 the soul: 5315 the testimony 5715 of the LORD 3068 [is] sure, 539-12 making wise 2449-56 the simple. 6612

19:8 The statutes 6490 of the LORD 3068 [are] right, 3477 rejoicing 8055-18 the heart: 3820 the commandment 4687 of the LORD 3068 [is] pure, 1249 enlightening 215-56 the eyes. 5869

19:9 The fear 3374 of the LORD 3068 [is] clean, 2889 enduring 5975-6 for ever: 5703 the judgments 4941 of the LORD 3068 [are] true 571 [and] righteous 6663-1 altogether. 3162

19:10 More to be desired 2530-12 [are they] than gold, 2091 yea, than much 7227 fine gold: 6337 sweeter 4966 also than honey 1706 and the honeycomb. 5317 6688

19:11 Moreover by them is thy servant 5650 warned: 2094-12 [and] in keeping 8104-2 of them [there is] great 7227 reward. 6118

19:12 Who can understand 995-4 [his] errors? 7691 cleanse 5352-16 thou me from secret 5641-12 [faults].

19:13 Keep back 2820-3 thy servant 5650 also from presumptuous 2086 [sins]; let them not have dominion 4910-4 over me: then shall I be upright, 8552-4 and I shall be innocent 5352-8 from the great 7227 transgression. 6588

19:14 Let the words 561 of my mouth, 6310 and the meditation 1902 of my heart, 3820 be acceptable 7522 in thy sight, 6440 O LORD, 3068 my strength, 6697 and my redeemer. 1350-6

20:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 The LORD 3068 hear 6030-4 thee in the day 3117 of trouble; 6869 the name 8034 of the God 430 of Jacob 3290 defend 7682-17 thee;

20:2 Send 7971-4 thee help 5828 from the sanctuary, 6944 and strengthen 5582-4 thee out of Zion; 6726

20:3 Remember 2142-4 all thy offerings, 4503 and accept 1878-17 thy burnt sacrifice; 5930 Selah. 5542

20:4 Grant 5414-4 thee according to thine own heart, 3824 and fulfil 4390-17 all thy counsel. 6098

20:5 We will rejoice 7442-17 in thy salvation, 3444 and in the name 8034 of our God 430 we will set up [our] banners: 1713-4 the LORD 3068 fulfil 4390-17 all thy petitions. 4862

20:6 Now know 3045-1 I that the LORD 3068 saveth 3467-52 his anointed; 4899 he will hear 6030-4 him from his holy 6944 heaven 8064 with the saving 3468 strength 1369 of his right hand. 3225

20:7 Some [trust] in chariots, 7393 and some in horses: 5483 but we will remember 2142-55 the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 our God. 430

20:8 They are brought down 3766-1 and fallen: 5307-1 but we are risen, 6965-1 and stand upright. 5749-104

20:9 Save, 3467-54 LORD: 3068 let the king 4428 hear 6030-4 us when 3117 we call. 7121-2

21:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 The king 4428 shall joy 8055-4 in thy strength, 5797 O LORD; 3068 and in thy salvation 3444 how greatly 3966 shall he rejoice! 1523-4

21:2 Thou hast given 5414-1 him his heart's 3820 desire, 8378 and hast not withholden 4513-1 the request 782 of his lips. 8193 Selah. 5542

21:3 For thou preventest 6923-17 him with the blessings 1293 of goodness: 2896 thou settest 7896-4 a crown 5850 of pure gold 6337 on his head. 7218

21:4 He asked 7592-1 life 2416 of thee, [and] thou gavest 5414-1 [it] him, [even] length 753 of days 3117 for ever 5769 and ever. 5703

21:5 His glory 3519 [is] great 1419 in thy salvation: 3444 honour 1935 and majesty 1926 hast thou laid 7737-17 upon him.

21:6 For thou hast made 7896-4 him most blessed 1293 for ever: 5703 thou hast made 2302-17 him exceeding glad 8057 with thy countenance. 6440

21:7 For the king 4428 trusteth 982-6 in the LORD, 3068 and through the mercy 2617 of the most High 5945 he shall not be moved. 4131-11

21:8 Thine hand 3027 shall find out 4672-4 all thine enemies: 341-6 thy right hand 3225 shall find out 4672-4 those that hate 8130-6 thee.

21:9 Thou shalt make 7896-4 them as a fiery 784 oven 8574 in the time 6256 of thine anger: 6440 the LORD 3068 shall swallow them up 1104-17 in his wrath, 639 and the fire 784 shall devour 398-4 them.

21:10 Their fruit 6529 shalt thou destroy 6-17 from the earth, 776 and their seed 2233 from among the children 1121 of men. 120

21:11 For they intended 5186-1 evil 7451 against thee: they imagined 2803-1 a mischievous device, 4209 [which] they are not able 3201-4 [to perform].

21:12 Therefore shalt thou make 7896-4 them turn their back, 7926 [when] thou shalt make ready 3559-34 [thine arrows] upon thy strings 4340 against the face 6440 of them.

21:13 Be thou exalted, 7311-3 LORD, 3068 in thine own strength: 5797 [so] will we sing 7891-4 and praise 2167-17 thy power. 1369

22:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 upon Aijeleth 365 Shahar, 7837 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 My God, 410 my God, 410 why hast thou forsaken 5800-1 me? [why art thou so] far 7350 from helping 3444 me, [and from] the words 1697 of my roaring? 7581

22:2 O my God, 430 I cry 7121-4 in the daytime, 3119 but thou hearest 6030-4 not; and in the night 3915 season, and am not silent. 1747

22:3 But thou [art] holy, 6918 [O thou] that inhabitest 3427-6 the praises 8416 of Israel. 3478

22:4 Our fathers 1 trusted 982-1 in thee: they trusted, 982-1 and thou didst deliver 6403-17 them.

22:5 They cried 2199-1 unto thee, and were delivered: 4422-8 they trusted 982-1 in thee, and were not confounded. 954-1

22:6 But I [am] a worm, 8438 and no man; 376 a reproach 2781 of men, 120 and despised 959-7 of the people. 5971

22:7 All they that see 7200-6 me laugh me to scorn: 3932-55 they shoot out 6362-55 the lip, 8193 they shake 5128-55 the head, 7218 [saying],

22:8 He trusted 1556-2 on the LORD 3068 [that] he would deliver 6403-17 him: let him deliver 5337-55 him, seeing he delighted 2654-1 in him.

22:9 But thou [art] he that took me out 1518-5 of the womb: 990 thou didst make me hope 982-56 [when I was] upon my mother's 517 breasts. 7699

22:10 I was cast 7993-90 upon thee from the womb: 7358 thou [art] my God 410 from my mother's 517 belly. 990

22:11 Be not far 7368-4 from me; for trouble 6869 [is] near; 7138 for [there is] none to help. 5826-6

22:12 Many 7227 bulls 6499 have compassed 5437-1 me: strong 47 [bulls] of Bashan 1316 have beset me round. 3803-14

22:13 They gaped 6475-1 upon me [with] their mouths, 6310 [as] a ravening 2963-6 and a roaring 7580-6 lion. 738

22:14 I am poured out 8210-8 like water, 4325 and all my bones 6106 are out of joint: 6504-98 my heart 3820 is like wax; 1749 it is melted 4549-8 in the midst 8432 of my bowels. 4578

22:15 My strength 3581 is dried up 3001-1 like a potsherd; 2789 and my tongue 3956 cleaveth 1692-94 to my jaws; 4455 and thou hast brought 8239-4 me into the dust 6083 of death. 4194

22:16 For dogs 3611 have compassed 5437-1 me: the assembly 5712 of the wicked 7489-56 have inclosed 5362-52 me: they pierced 3738-1|738-k my hands 3027 and my feet. 7272

22:17 I may tell 5608-17 all my bones: 6106 they look 5027-55 [and] stare 7200-4 upon me.

22:18 They part 2505-17 my garments 899 among them, and cast 5307-55 lots 1486 upon my vesture. 3830

22:19 But be not thou far 7368-4 from me, O LORD: 3068 O my strength, 360 haste 2363-3 thee to help 5833 me.

22:20 Deliver 5337-54 my soul 5315 from the sword; 2719 my darling 3173 from the power 3027 of the dog. 3611

22:21 Save 3467-54 me from the lion's 738 mouth: 6310 for thou hast heard 6030-1 me from the horns 7161 of the unicorns. 7214

22:22 I will declare 5608-17 thy name 8034 unto my brethren: 251 in the midst 8432 of the congregation 6951 will I praise 1984-17 thee.

22:23 Ye that fear 3373 the LORD, 3068 praise 1984-16 him; all ye the seed 2233 of Jacob, 3290 glorify 3513-16 him; and fear 1481-3 him, all ye the seed 2233 of Israel. 3478

22:24 For he hath not despised 959-1 nor abhorred 8262-14 the affliction 6039 of the afflicted; 6041 neither hath he hid 5641-52 his face 6440 from him; but when he cried 7768-15 unto him, he heard. 8085-1

22:25 My praise 8416 [shall be] of thee in the great 7227 congregation: 6951 I will pay 7999-17 my vows 5088 before them that fear 3373 him.

22:26 The meek 6035 shall eat 398-4 and be satisfied: 7646-4 they shall praise 1984-17 the LORD 3068 that seek 1875-6 him: your heart 3824 shall live 2421-4 for ever. 5703

22:27 All the ends 657 of the world 776 shall remember 2142-4 and turn 7725-4 unto the LORD: 3068 and all the kindreds 4940 of the nations 1471 shall worship 7812-101 before 6440 thee.

22:28 For the kingdom 4410 [is] the LORD'S: 3068 and he [is] the governor 4910-6 among the nations. 1471

22:29 All [they that be] fat 1879 upon earth 776 shall eat 398-1 and worship: 7812-101 all they that go down 3381-6 to the dust 6083 shall bow 3766-4 before 6440 him: and none can keep alive 2421-14 his own soul. 5315

22:30 A seed 2233 shall serve 5647-4 him; it shall be accounted 5608-29 to the Lord 136 for a generation. 1755

22:31 They shall come, 935-4 and shall declare 5046-55 his righteousness 6664 unto a people 5971 that shall be born, 3205-12 that he hath done 6213-1 [this].

23:1 <A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 The LORD 3068 [is] my shepherd; 7462-6 I shall not want. 2637-4

23:2 He maketh me to lie down 7257-55 in green 1877 pastures: 4999 he leadeth 5095-17 me beside the still 4496 waters. 4325

23:3 He restoreth 7725-34 my soul: 5315 he leadeth 5148-55 me in the paths 4570 of righteousness 6664 for his name's 8034 sake.

23:4 Yea, though I walk 3212-4 through the valley 1516 of the shadow of death, 6757 I will fear 3372-4 no evil: 7451 for thou [art] with me; thy rod 7626 and thy staff 4938 they comfort 5162-17 me.

23:5 Thou preparest 6186-4 a table 7979 before 6440 me in the presence of mine enemies: 6887-6 thou anointest 1878-14 my head 7218 with oil; 8081 my cup 3563 runneth over. 7310

23:6 Surely goodness 2896 and mercy 2617 shall follow 7291-4 me all the days 3117 of my life: 2416 and I will dwell 3427-1 in the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 for ever. 753 3117

24:1 <A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 The earth 776 [is] the LORD'S, 3068 and the fulness 4393 thereof; the world, 8398 and they that dwell 3427-6 therein.

24:2 For he hath founded 3245-1 it upon the seas, 3220 and established 3559-34 it upon the floods. 5104

24:3 Who shall ascend 5927-4 into the hill 2022 of the LORD? 3068 or who shall stand 6965-4 in his holy 6944 place? 4725

24:4 He that hath clean 5355 hands, 3709 and a pure 1249 heart; 3824 who hath not lifted up 5375-1 his soul 5315 unto vanity, 7723 nor sworn 7650-8 deceitfully. 4820

24:5 He shall receive 5375-4 the blessing 1293 from the LORD, 3068 and righteousness 6666 from the God 430 of his salvation. 3468

24:6 This [is] the generation 1755 of them that seek 1875-6 him, that seek 1245-18 thy face, 6440 O Jacob. 3290 Selah. 5542

24:7 Lift up 5375-3 your heads, 7218 O ye gates; 8179 and be ye lift up, 5375-10 ye everlasting 5769 doors; 6607 and the King 4428 of glory 3519 shall come in. 935-4

24:8 Who [is] this King 4428 of glory? 3519 The LORD 3068 strong 5808 and mighty, 1368 the LORD 3068 mighty 1368 in battle. 4421

24:9 Lift up 5375-3 your heads, 7218 O ye gates; 8179 even lift [them] up, 5375-3 ye everlasting 5769 doors; 6607 and the King 4428 of glory 3519 shall come in. 935-4

24:10 Who is this King 4428 of glory? 3519 The LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 he [is] the King 4428 of glory. 3519 Selah. 5542

25:1 <[A Psalm] of David.> 1732 Unto thee, O LORD, 3068 do I lift up 5375-4 my soul. 5315

25:2 O my God, 430 I trust 982-1 in thee: let me not be ashamed, 954-4 let not mine enemies 341-6 triumph 5970-4 over me.

25:3 Yea, let none that wait 6960-6 on thee be ashamed: 954-4 let them be ashamed 954-4 which transgress 898-6 without cause. 7387

25:4 Shew 3045-54 me thy ways, 1870 O LORD; 3068 teach 3925-16 me thy paths. 734

25:5 Lead 1869-54 me in thy truth, 571 and teach 3925-16 me: for thou [art] the God 430 of my salvation; 3468 on thee do I wait 6960-14 all the day. 3117

25:6 Remember, 2142-3 O LORD, 3068 thy tender mercies 7356 and thy lovingkindnesses; 2617 for they [have been] ever of old. 5769

25:7 Remember 2142-4 not the sins 2403 of my youth, 5271 nor my transgressions: 6588 according to thy mercy 2617 remember 2142-3 thou me for thy goodness' 2898 sake, O LORD. 3068

25:8 Good 2896 and upright 3477 [is] the LORD: 3068 therefore will he teach 3384-55 sinners 2400 in the way. 1870

25:9 The meek 6035 will he guide 1869-55 in judgment: 4941 and the meek 6035 will he teach 3925-17 his way. 1870

25:10 All the paths 734 of the LORD 3068 [are] mercy 2617 and truth 571 unto such as keep 5341-6 his covenant 1285 and his testimonies. 5713

25:11 For thy name's 8034 sake, O LORD, 3068 pardon 5545-1 mine iniquity; 5771 for it [is] great. 7227

25:12 What man 376 [is] he that feareth 3373 the LORD? 3068 him shall he teach 3384-55 in the way 1870 [that] he shall choose. 977-4

25:13 His soul 5315 shall dwell 3885-4 at ease; 2896 and his seed 2233 shall inherit 3423-4 the earth. 776

25:14 The secret 5475 of the LORD 3068 [is] with them that fear 3373 him; and he will shew 3045-53 them his covenant. 1285

25:15 Mine eyes 5869 [are] ever 8548 toward the LORD; 3068 for he shall pluck my feet 7272 out 3318-55 of the net. 7568

25:16 Turn 6437-3 thee unto me, and have mercy 2603-3 upon me; for I [am] desolate 3173 and afflicted. 6041

25:17 The troubles 6869 of my heart 3824 are enlarged: 7337-52 [O] bring thou me out 3318-54 of my distresses. 4691

25:18 Look 7200-3 upon mine affliction 6040 and my pain; 5999 and forgive 5375-3 all my sins. 2403

25:19 Consider 7200-3 mine enemies; 341-6 for they are many; 7231-1 and they hate 8130-1 me with cruel 2555 hatred. 8135

25:20 O keep 8104-3 my soul, 5315 and deliver 5337-54 me: let me not be ashamed; 954-4 for I put my trust 2620-1 in thee.

25:21 Let integrity 8537 and uprightness 3476 preserve 5341-4 me; for I wait 6960-14 on thee.

25:22 Redeem 6299-3 Israel, 3478 O God, 430 out of all his troubles. 6869

26:1 <[A Psalm] of David.> 1732 Judge 8199-3 me, O LORD; 3068 for I have walked 1980-1 in mine integrity: 8537 I have trusted 982-1 also in the LORD; 3068 [therefore] I shall not slide. 4571-4

26:2 Examine 974-3 me, O LORD, 3068 and prove 5254-16 me; try 6884-3 my reins 3629 and my heart. 3820

26:3 For thy lovingkindness 2617 [is] before mine eyes: 5869 and I have walked 1980-98 in thy truth. 571

26:4 I have not sat 3427-1 with vain 7723 persons, 4962 neither will I go in 935-4 with dissemblers. 5956-12

26:5 I have hated 8130-1 the congregation 6951 of evil doers; 7489-56 and will not sit 3427-4 with the wicked. 7563

26:6 I will wash 7364-4 mine hands 3709 in innocency: 5356 so will I compass 5437-25 thine altar, 4196 O LORD: 3068

26:7 That I may publish 8085-53 with the voice 6963 of thanksgiving, 8426 and tell 5608-15 of all thy wondrous works. 6381-12

26:8 LORD, 3068 I have loved 157-1 the habitation 4583 of thy house, 1004 and the place 4725 where thine honour 3519 dwelleth. 4908

26:9 Gather 622-4 not my soul 5315 with sinners, 2400 nor my life 2416 with bloody 1818 men: 582

26:10 In whose hands 3027 [is] mischief, 2154 and their right hand 3225 is full 4390-1 of bribes. 7810

26:11 But as for me, I will walk 3212-4 in mine integrity: 8537 redeem 6299-3 me, and be merciful 2603-3 unto me.

26:12 My foot 7272 standeth 5975-1 in an even place: 4334 in the congregations 4721 will I bless 1288-17 the LORD. 3068

27:1 <[A Psalm] of David.> 1732 The LORD 3068 [is] my light 216 and my salvation; 3468 whom shall I fear? 3372-4 the LORD 3068 [is] the strength 4581 of my life; 2416 of whom shall I be afraid? 6342-4

27:2 When the wicked, 7489-56 [even] mine enemies 6862 and my foes, 341-6 came 7126-2 upon me to eat up 398-2 my flesh, 1320 they stumbled 3782-1 and fell. 5307-1

27:3 Though an host 4264 should encamp 2583-4 against me, my heart 3820 shall not fear: 3372-4 though war 4421 should rise 6965-4 against me, in this [will] I [be] confident. 982-6

27:4 One 259 [thing] have I desired 7592-1 of the LORD, 3068 that will I seek 1245-17 after; that I may dwell 3427-2 in the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 all the days 3117 of my life, 2416 to behold 2372-2 the beauty 5278 of the LORD, 3068 and to enquire 1239-15 in his temple. 1964

27:5 For in the time 3117 of trouble 7451 he shall hide 6845-4 me in his pavilion: 5520 in the secret 5643 of his tabernacle 168 shall he hide 5641-55 me; he shall set me up 7311-34 upon a rock. 6697

27:6 And now shall mine head 7218 be lifted up 7311-4 above mine enemies 341-6 round about 5439 me: therefore will I offer 2076-4 in his tabernacle 168 sacrifices 2077 of joy; 8643 I will sing, 7891-4 yea, I will sing praises 2167-17 unto the LORD. 3068

27:7 Hear, 8085-3 O LORD, 3068 [when] I cry 7121-4 with my voice: 6963 have mercy 2603-3 also upon me, and answer 6030-3 me.

27:8 [When thou saidst], Seek 1245-16 ye my face; 6440 my heart 3820 said 559-1 unto thee, Thy face, 6440 LORD, 3068 will I seek. 1245-17

27:9 Hide 5641-55 not thy face 6440 [far] from me; put not thy servant 5650 away 5186-55 in anger: 639 thou hast been my help; 5833 leave 5203-4 me not, neither forsake 5800-4 me, O God 430 of my salvation. 3468

27:10 When my father 1 and my mother 517 forsake 5800-1 me, then the LORD 3068 will take me up. 622-4

27:11 Teach 3384-54 me thy way, 1870 O LORD, 3068 and lead 5148-3 me in a plain 4334 path, 734 because of mine enemies. 8324-6

27:12 Deliver 5414-4 me not over unto the will 5315 of mine enemies: 6862 for false 8267 witnesses 5707 are risen up 6965-1 against me, and such as breathe out 3307 cruelty. 2555

27:13 [I had fainted], unless 3884 I had believed 539-52 to see 7200-2 the goodness 2898 of the LORD 3068 in the land 776 of the living. 2416

27:14 Wait 6960-16 on the LORD: 3068 be of good courage, 2388-3 and he shall strengthen 553-55 thine heart: 3820 wait, 6960-16 I say, on the LORD. 3068

28:1 <[A Psalm] of David.> 1732 Unto thee will I cry, 7121-4 O LORD 3068 my rock; 6697 be not 408 silent 2790-4 to me: lest, 6435 [if] thou be silent 2814-4 to me, I become like 4911-8 them that go down 3381-6 into the pit. 953

28:2 Hear 8085-3 the voice 6963 of my supplications, 8469 when I cry 7768-15 unto thee, when I lift up 5375-2 my hands 3027 toward thy holy 6944 oracle. 1687

28:3 Draw 4900-4 me not away with the wicked, 7563 and with the workers 6466-6 of iniquity, 205 which speak 1696-6 peace 7965 to their neighbours, 7453 but mischief 7451 [is] in their hearts. 3824

28:4 Give 5414-3 them according to their deeds, 6467 and according to the wickedness 7455 of their endeavours: 4611 give 5414-3 them after the work 4639 of their hands; 3027 render 7725-54 to them their desert. 1576

28:5 Because they regard 995-4 not the works 6468 of the LORD, 3068 nor the operation 4639 of his hands, 3027 he shall destroy 2040-4 them, and not build them up. 1129-4

28:6 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD, 3068 because he hath heard 8085-1 the voice 6963 of my supplications. 8469

28:7 The LORD 3068 [is] my strength 5797 and my shield; 4043 my heart 3820 trusted 982-1 in him, and I am helped: 5826-8 therefore my heart 3820 greatly rejoiceth; 5937-4 and with my song 7892 will I praise 3034-55 him.

28:8 The LORD 3068 [is] their strength, 5797 and he [is] the saving 3444 strength 4581 of his anointed. 4899

28:9 Save 3467-54 thy people, 5971 and bless 1288-16 thine inheritance: 5159 feed 7462-3 them also, and lift them up 5375-16 for ever. 5769

29:1 <A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 Give 3051-3 unto the LORD, 3068 O ye mighty, 1121 410 give 3051-3 unto the LORD 3068 glory 3519 and strength. 5797

29:2 Give 3051-3 unto the LORD 3068 the glory 3519 due unto his name; 8034 worship 7812-100 the LORD 3068 in the beauty 1927 of holiness. 6944

29:3 The voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 [is] upon the waters: 4325 the God 410 of glory 3519 thundereth: 7481-52 the LORD 3068 [is] upon many 7227 waters. 4325

29:4 The voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 [is] powerful; 3581 the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 [is] full of majesty. 1926

29:5 The voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 breaketh 7665-6 the cedars; 730 yea, the LORD 3068 breaketh 7665-17 the cedars 730 of Lebanon. 3844

29:6 He maketh them also to skip 7540-55 like a calf; 5695 Lebanon 3844 and Sirion 8303 like a young 1121 unicorn. 7214

29:7 The voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 divideth 2672-6 the flames 3852 of fire. 784

29:8 The voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 shaketh 2342-4 the wilderness; 4057 the LORD 3068 shaketh 2342-4 the wilderness 4057 of Kadesh. 6946

29:9 The voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 maketh the hinds 355 to calve, 2342-34 and discovereth 2834-4 the forests: 3295 and in his temple 1964 doth every one speak 559-6 of [his] glory. 3519

29:10 The LORD 3068 sitteth 3427-1 upon the flood; 3999 yea, the LORD 3068 sitteth 3427-4 King 4428 for ever. 5769

29:11 The LORD 3068 will give 5414-4 strength 5797 unto his people; 5971 the LORD 3068 will bless 1288-17 his people 5971 with peace. 7965

30:1 <A Psalm 4210 [and] Song 7892 [at] the dedication 2598 of the house 1004 of David.> 1732 I will extol 7311-34 thee, O LORD; 3068 for thou hast lifted me up, 1802-14 and hast not made my foes 341-6 to rejoice 8055-14 over me.

30:2 O LORD 3068 my God, 430 I cried 7768-14 unto thee, and thou hast healed 7495-4 me.

30:3 O LORD, 3068 thou hast brought up 5927-52 my soul 5315 from the grave: 7585 thou hast kept me alive, 2421-14 that I should not go down 3381-2|3381-6-k to the pit. 953

30:4 Sing 2167-16 unto the LORD, 3068 O ye saints 2623 of his, and give thanks 3034-54 at the remembrance 2143 of his holiness. 6944

30:5 For his anger 639 [endureth but] a moment; 7281 in his favour 7522 [is] life: 2416 weeping 1065 may endure 3885-4 for a night, 6153 but joy 7440 [cometh] in the morning. 1242

30:6 And in my prosperity 7959 I said, 559-1 I shall never 1097 5769 be moved. 4131-11

30:7 LORD, 3068 by thy favour 7522 thou hast made my mountain 2042 to stand 5975-52 strong: 5797 thou didst hide 5641-52 thy face, 6440 [and] I was troubled. 926-12

30:8 I cried 7121-4 to thee, O LORD; 3068 and unto the LORD 3068 I made supplication. 2603-101

30:9 What profit 1215 [is there] in my blood, 1818 when I go down 3381-2 to the pit? 7845 Shall the dust 6083 praise 3034-55 thee? shall it declare 5046-55 thy truth? 571

30:10 Hear, 8085-3 O LORD, 3068 and have mercy 2603-3 upon me: LORD, 3068 be thou my helper. 5826-6

30:11 Thou hast turned 2015-1 for me my mourning 4553 into dancing: 4234 thou hast put off 6605-14 my sackcloth, 8242 and girded 247-17 me with gladness; 8057

30:12 To the end that [my] glory 3519 may sing praise 2167-17 to thee, and not be silent. 1826-4 O LORD 3068 my God, 430 I will give thanks 3034-55 unto thee for ever. 5769

31:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 In thee, O LORD, 3068 do I put my trust; 2620-1 let me never 408 5769 be ashamed: 954-4 deliver 6403-16 me in thy righteousness. 6666

31:2 Bow down 5186-54 thine ear 241 to me; deliver 5337-54 me speedily: 4120 be thou my strong 4581 rock, 6697 for an house 1004 of defence 4686 to save 3467-53 me.

31:3 For thou [art] my rock 5553 and my fortress; 4686 therefore for thy name's 8034 sake lead 5148-55 me, and guide 5095-17 me.

31:4 Pull me out 3318-55 of the net 7568 that 2098 they have laid privily 2934-1 for me: for thou [art] my strength. 4581

31:5 Into thine hand 3027 I commit 6485-55 my spirit: 7307 thou hast redeemed 6299-1 me, O LORD 3068 God 410 of truth. 571

31:6 I have hated 8130-1 them that regard 8104-6 lying 7723 vanities: 1892 but I trust 982-1 in the LORD. 3068

31:7 I will be glad 1523-4 and rejoice 8055-4 in thy mercy: 2617 for thou hast considered 7200-1 my trouble; 6040 thou hast known 3045-1 my soul 5315 in adversities; 6869

31:8 And hast not shut me up 5462-52 into the hand 3027 of the enemy: 341-6 thou hast set 5975-52 my feet 7272 in a large room. 4800

31:9 Have mercy 2603-3 upon me, O LORD, 3068 for I am in trouble: 6887-1 mine eye 5869 is consumed 6244-1 with grief, 3708 [yea], my soul 5315 and my belly. 990

31:10 For my life 2416 is spent 3615-1 with grief, 3015 and my years 8141 with sighing: 585 my strength 3581 faileth 3782-1 because of mine iniquity, 5771 and my bones 6106 are consumed. 6244-1

31:11 I was a reproach 2781 among all mine enemies, 6887-6 but especially 3966 among my neighbours, 7934 and a fear 6343 to mine acquaintance: 3045-30 they that did see 7200-6 me without 2351 fled 5074-1 from me.

31:12 I am forgotten 7911-8 as a dead man 4191-5 out of mind: 3820 I am like a broken 6-6 vessel. 3627

31:13 For I have heard 8085-1 the slander 1681 of many: 7227 fear 4032 [was] on every side: 5439 while they took counsel 3245-9 together 3162 against me, they devised 2161-1 to take away 3947-2 my life. 5315

31:14 But I trusted 982-1 in thee, O LORD: 3068 I said, 559-1 Thou [art] my God. 430

31:15 My times 6256 [are] in thy hand: 3027 deliver 5337-54 me from the hand 3027 of mine enemies, 341-6 and from them that persecute 7291-6 me.

31:16 Make thy face 6440 to shine 215-54 upon thy servant: 5650 save 3467-54 me for thy mercies' 2617 sake.

31:17 Let me not be ashamed, 954-4 O LORD; 3068 for I have called 7121-1 upon thee: let the wicked 7563 be ashamed, 954-4 [and] let them be silent 1826-4 in the grave. 7585

31:18 Let the lying 8267 lips 8193 be put to silence; 481-11 which speak 1696-6 grievous things 6277 proudly 1346 and contemptuously 937 against the righteous. 6662

31:19 [Oh] how great 7227 [is] thy goodness, 2898 which thou hast laid up 6845-1 for them that fear 3373 thee; [which] thou hast wrought 6466-1 for them that trust 2620-6 in thee before the sons 1121 of men! 120

31:20 Thou shalt hide 5641-55 them in the secret 5643 of thy presence 6440 from the pride 7407 of man: 376 thou shalt keep them secretly 6845-4 in a pavilion 5521 from the strife 7379 of tongues. 395 

31:21 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD: 3068 for he hath shewed me his marvellous 6381-52 kindness 2617 in a strong 4692 city. 5892

31:22 For I said 559-1 in my haste, 2648-2 I am cut off 1629-8 from before 5048 thine eyes: 5869 nevertheless 403 thou heardest 8085-1 the voice 6963 of my supplications 8469 when I cried 7768-15 unto thee.

31:23 O love 157-3 the LORD, 3068 all ye his saints: 2623 [for] the LORD 3068 preserveth 5341-6 the faithful, 539-7 and plentifully 3499 rewardeth 7999-18 the proud 1346 doer. 6213

31:24 Be of good courage, 2388-3 and he shall strengthen 553-55 your heart, 3824 all ye that hope 3176-18 in the LORD. 3068

32:1 <[A Psalm] of David, 1732 Maschil.> 4905|7919-56 Blessed 835 [is he whose] transgression 6588 [is] forgiven, 5375-7 [whose] sin 2401 [is] covered. 3680-7

32:2 Blessed 835 [is] the man 120 unto whom the LORD 3068 imputeth 2803-4 not iniquity, 5771 and in whose spirit 7307 [there is] no guile. 7423

32:3 When I kept silence, 2790-52 my bones 6106 waxed old 1086-1 through my roaring 7581 all the day 3117 long.

32:4 For day 3119 and night 3915 thy hand 3027 was heavy 3513-4 upon me: my moisture 3955 is turned 2015-8 into the drought 2725 of summer. 7019 Selah. 5542

32:5 I acknowledged 3045-55 my sin 2403 unto thee, and mine iniquity 5771 have I not hid. 3680-14 I said, 559-1 I will confess 3034-55 my transgressions 6588 unto the LORD; 3068 and thou forgavest 5375-1 the iniquity 5771 of my sin. 2403 Selah. 5542

32:6 For this shall every one that is godly 2623 pray 6419-101 unto thee in a time 6256 when thou mayest be found: 4672-2 surely in the floods 7858 of great 7227 waters 4325 they shall not come nigh 5060-55 unto him.

32:7 Thou [art] my hiding place; 5643 thou shalt preserve 5341-4 me from trouble; 6862 thou shalt compass me about 5437-25 with songs 7438 of deliverance. 6405 Selah. 5542

32:8 I will instruct 7919-55 thee and teach 3384-55 thee in the way 1870 which 2098 thou shalt go: 3212-4 I will guide 3289-4 thee with mine eye. 5869

32:9 Be ye not as the horse, 5483 [or] as the mule, 6505 [which] have no understanding: 995-53 whose mouth 5716 must be held 1102-2 in with bit 4964 and bridle, 7448 lest 1077 they come near 7126-2 unto thee.

32:10 Many 7227 sorrows 4341 [shall be] to the wicked: 7563 but he that trusteth 982-6 in the LORD, 3068 mercy 2617 shall compass him about. 5437-25

32:11 Be glad 8055-3 in the LORD, 3068 and rejoice, 1523-3 ye righteous: 6662 and shout for joy, 7442-54 all [ye that are] upright 3477 in heart. 3820

33:1 Rejoice 7442-16 in the LORD, 3068 O ye righteous: 6662 [for] praise 8416 is comely 5000 for the upright. 3477

33:2 Praise 3034-54 the LORD 3068 with harp: 3658 sing 2167-16 unto him with the psaltery 5035 [and] an instrument of ten 6218 strings.

33:3 Sing 7891-3 unto him a new 2319 song; 7892 play 5059-15 skilfully 3190-54 with a loud noise. 8643

33:4 For the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 [is] right; 3477 and all his works 4639 [are done] in truth. 530

33:5 He loveth 157-6 righteousness 6666 and judgment: 4941 the earth 776 is full 4390-1 of the goodness 2617 of the LORD. 3068

33:6 By the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 were the heavens 8064 made; 6213-8 and all the host 6635 of them by the breath 7307 of his mouth. 6310

33:7 He gathereth 3664-6 the waters 4325 of the sea 3220 together as an heap: 5067 he layeth up 5414-6 the depth 8415 in storehouses. 214

33:8 Let all the earth 776 fear 3372-4 the LORD: 3068 let all the inhabitants 3427-6 of the world 8398 stand in awe 1481-4 of him.

33:9 For he spake, 559-1 and it was [done]; he commanded, 6680-14 and it stood fast. 5975-4

33:10 The LORD 3068 bringeth the counsel 6098 of the heathen 1471 to nought: 6331-52 he maketh the devices 4284 of the people 5971 of none effect. 5106-52

33:11 The counsel 6098 of the LORD 3068 standeth 5975-4 for ever, 5769 the thoughts 4284 of his heart 3820 to all 1755 generations. 1755

33:12 Blessed 835 [is] the nation 1471 whose God 430 [is] the LORD; 3068 [and] the people 5971 [whom] he hath chosen 977-1 for his own inheritance. 5159

33:13 The LORD 3068 looketh 5027-52 from heaven; 8064 he beholdeth 7200-1 all the sons 1121 of men. 120

33:14 From the place 4349 of his habitation 3427-2 he looketh 7688-52 upon all the inhabitants 3427-6 of the earth. 776

33:15 He fashioneth 3335-6 their hearts 3820 alike; 3162 he considereth 995-56 all their works. 4639

33:16 There is no king 4428 saved 3467-12 by the multitude 7230 of an host: 2428 a mighty man 1368 is not delivered 5337-11 by much 7230 strength. 3581

33:17 An horse 5483 [is] a vain thing 8267 for safety: 8668 neither shall he deliver 4422-17 [any] by his great 7230 strength. 2428

33:18 Behold, the eye 5869 of the LORD 3068 [is] upon them that fear 3373 him, upon them that hope 3176-18 in his mercy; 2617

33:19 To deliver 5337-53 their soul 5315 from death, 4194 and to keep them alive 2421-15 in famine. 7458

33:20 Our soul 5315 waiteth 2442-14 for the LORD: 3068 he [is] our help 5828 and our shield. 4043

33:21 For our heart 3820 shall rejoice 8055-4 in him, because we have trusted 982-1 in his holy 6944 name. 8034

33:22 Let thy mercy, 2617 O LORD, 3068 be upon us, according as we hope 3176-14 in thee.

34:1 <[A Psalm] of David, 1732 when he changed 8138-15 his behaviour 2940 before 6440 Abimelech; 40 who drove him away, 1644-17 and he departed.> 3212-4 I will bless 1288-17 the LORD 3068 at all times: 6256 his praise 8416 [shall] continually 8548 [be] in my mouth. 6310

34:2 My soul 5315 shall make her boast 1984-101 in the LORD: 3068 the humble 6035 shall hear 8085-4 [thereof], and be glad. 8055-4

34:3 O magnify 1431-16 the LORD 3068 with me, and let us exalt 7311-34 his name 8034 together. 3162

34:4 I sought 1875-1 the LORD, 3068 and he heard 6030-1 me, and delivered 5337-52 me from all my fears. 4035

34:5 They looked 5027-52 unto him, and were lightened: 5102-1 and their faces 6440 were not ashamed. 2659-4

34:6 This poor 6041 man cried, 7121-1 and the LORD 3068 heard 8085-1 [him], and saved 3467-52 him out of all his troubles. 6869

34:7 The angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 encampeth 2583-6 round about 5439 them that fear 3373 him, and delivereth 2502-17 them.

34:8 O taste 2938-3 and see 7200-3 that the LORD 3068 [is] good: 2896 blessed 835 [is] the man 1397 [that] trusteth 2620-4 in him.

34:9 O fear 3372-3 the LORD, 3068 ye his saints: 6918 for [there is] no want 4270 to them that fear 3373 him.

34:10 The young lions 3715 do lack, 7326-1 and suffer hunger: 7456-1 but they that seek 1875-6 the LORD 3068 shall not want 2637-4 any good 2896 [thing].

34:11 Come, 3212-3 ye children, 1121 hearken 8085-3 unto me: I will teach 3925-17 you the fear 3374 of the LORD. 3068

34:12 What man 376 [is he that] desireth 2655 life, 2416 [and] loveth 157-6 [many] days, 3117 that he may see 7200-2 good? 2896

34:13 Keep 5341-3 thy tongue 3956 from evil, 7451 and thy lips 8193 from speaking 1696-15 guile. 4820

34:14 Depart 5493-3 from evil, 7451 and do 6213-3 good; 2896 seek 1245-16 peace, 7965 and pursue 7291-3 it.

34:15 The eyes 5869 of the LORD 3068 [are] upon the righteous, 6662 and his ears 241 [are open] unto their cry. 7775

34:16 The face 6440 of the LORD 3068 [is] against them that do 6213-6 evil, 7451 to cut off 3772-53 the remembrance 2143 of them from the earth. 776

34:17 [The righteous] cry, 6817-1 and the LORD 3068 heareth, 8085-1 and delivereth 5337-52 them out of all their troubles. 6869

34:18 The LORD 3068 [is] nigh 7138 unto them that are of a broken 7665-12 heart; 3820 and saveth 3467-55 such as be of a contrite 1793 spirit. 7307

34:19 Many 7227 [are] the afflictions 7451 of the righteous: 6662 but the LORD 3068 delivereth 5337-55 him out of them all.

34:20 He keepeth 8104-6 all his bones: 6106 not one 259 of them 2007 is broken. 7665-8

34:21 Evil 7451 shall slay 4191-34 the wicked: 7563 and they that hate 8130-6 the righteous 6662 shall be desolate. 816-4

34:22 The LORD 3068 redeemeth 6299-6 the soul 5315 of his servants: 5650 and none of them that trust 2620-6 in him shall be desolate. 816-4

35:1 <[A Psalm] of David.> 1732 Plead 7378-3 [my cause], O LORD, 3068 with them that strive 3401 with me: fight 3898-3 against them that fight 3898-6 against me.

35:2 Take hold 2388-54 of shield 4043 and buckler, 6793 and stand up 6965-3 for mine help. 5833

35:3 Draw out 7324-54 also the spear, 2595 and stop 5462-3 [the way] against 7125-2 them that persecute 7291-6 me: say 559-3 unto my soul, 5315 I [am] thy salvation. 3444

35:4 Let them be confounded 954-4 and put to shame 3637-11 that seek 1245-18 after my soul: 5315 let them be turned 5472-11 back 268 and brought to confusion 2659-4 that devise 2803-6 my hurt. 7451

35:5 Let them be as chaff 4671 before 6440 the wind: 7307 and let the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 chase 1760-6 [them].

35:6 Let their way 1870 be dark 2822 and slippery: 2519 and let the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 persecute 7291-6 them.

35:7 For without cause 2600 have they hid 2934-1 for me their net 7568 [in] a pit, 7845 [which] without cause 2600 they have digged 2658-1 for my soul. 5315

35:8 Let destruction 7722 come 935-4 upon him at unawares; 3045-4 3808 and let his net 7568 that he hath hid 2934-1 catch 3920-4 himself: into that very destruction 7722 let him fall. 5307-4

35:9 And my soul 5315 shall be joyful 1523-4 in the LORD: 3068 it shall rejoice 7797-4 in his salvation. 3444

35:10 All my bones 6106 shall say, 559-4 LORD, 3068 who [is] like unto thee, which deliverest 5337-56 the poor 6041 from him that is too strong 2389 for him, yea, the poor 6041 and the needy 34 from him that spoileth 1497-6 him?

35:11 False 2555 witnesses 5707 did rise up; 6965-4 they laid to my charge 7592-4 [things] that I knew 3045-1 not.

35:12 They rewarded 7999-17 me evil 7451 for good 2896 [to] the spoiling 7908 of my soul. 5315

35:13 But as for me, when they were sick, 2470-2 my clothing 3830 [was] sackcloth: 8242 I humbled 6031-14 my soul 5315 with fasting; 6685 and my prayer 8605 returned 7725-4 into mine own bosom. 2436

35:14 I behaved 1980-98 myself as though [he had been] my friend 7453 [or] brother: 251 I bowed down 7817-1 heavily, 6937-6 as one that mourneth 57 [for his] mother. 517

35:15 But in mine adversity 6761 they rejoiced, 8055-1 and gathered 622-8 themselves together: [yea], the abjects 5222 gathered 622-8 themselves together against me, and I knew 3045-1 [it] not; they did tear 7167-1 [me], and ceased 1826-1 not:

35:16 With hypocritical 2611 mockers 3934 in feasts, 4580 they gnashed 2786-2 upon me with their teeth. 8127

35:17 Lord, 136 how long wilt thou look on? 7200-4 rescue 7725-54 my soul 5315 from their destructions, 7722 my darling 3173 from the lions. 3715

35:18 I will give thee thanks 3034-55 in the great 7227 congregation: 6951 I will praise 1984-17 thee among much 6099 people. 5971

35:19 Let not them that are mine enemies 341-6 wrongfully 8267 rejoice 8055-4 over me: [neither] let them wink 7169-4 with the eye 5869 that hate 8130-6 me without a cause. 2600

35:20 For they speak 1696-17 not peace: 7965 but they devise 2803-4 deceitful 4820 matters 1697 against [them that are] quiet 7282 in the land. 776

35:21 Yea, they opened their mouth 6310 wide 7337-55 against me, [and] said, 559-1 Aha, 1889 aha, 1889 our eye 5869 hath seen 7200-1 [it].

35:22 [This] thou hast seen, 7200-1 O LORD: 3068 keep not silence: 2790-4 O Lord, 136 be not far 7368-4 from me.

35:23 Stir up 5782-54 thyself, and awake 6974-54 to my judgment, 4941 [even] unto my cause, 7379 my God 430 and my Lord. 136

35:24 Judge 8199-3 me, O LORD 3068 my God, 430 according to thy righteousness; 6664 and let them not rejoice 8055-4 over me.

35:25 Let them not say 559-4 in their hearts, 3820 Ah, 1889 so would we have it: 5315 let them not say, 559-4 We have swallowed him up. 1104-14

35:26 Let them be ashamed 954-4 and brought to confusion 2659-4 together 3162 that rejoice 8056 at mine hurt: 7451 let them be clothed 3847-4 with shame 1322 and dishonour 3639 that magnify 1431-56 [themselves] against me.

35:27 Let them shout for joy, 7442-4 and be glad, 8055-4 that favour 2655 my righteous cause: 6664 yea, let them say 559-4 continually, 8548 Let the LORD 3068 be magnified, 1431-4 which hath pleasure 2655 in the prosperity 7965 of his servant. 5650

35:28 And my tongue 3956 shall speak 1897-4 of thy righteousness 6664 [and] of thy praise 8416 all the day 3117 long.

36:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 [A Psalm] of David 1732 the servant 5650 of the LORD.> 3068 The transgression 6588 of the wicked 7563 saith 5002-7 within 7130 my heart, 3820 [that there is] no fear 6343 of God 430 before his eyes. 5869

36:2 For he flattereth 2505-52 himself in his own eyes, 5869 until his iniquity 5771 be found 4672-2 to be hateful. 8130-2

36:3 The words 1697 of his mouth 6310 [are] iniquity 205 and deceit: 4820 he hath left off 2308-1 to be wise, 7919-53 [and] to do good. 3190-53

36:4 He deviseth 2803-4 mischief 205 upon his bed; 4904 he setteth 3320-101 himself in a way 1870 [that is] not good; 2896 he abhorreth 3988-4 not evil. 7451

36:5 Thy mercy, 2617 O LORD, 3068 [is] in the heavens; 8064 [and] thy faithfulness 530 [reacheth] unto the clouds. 7834

36:6 Thy righteousness 6666 [is] like the great 410 mountains; 2042 thy judgments 4941 [are] a great 7227 deep: 8415 O LORD, 3068 thou preservest 3467-55 man 120 and beast. 929

36:7 How excellent 3368 [is] thy lovingkindness, 2617 O God! 430 therefore the children 1121 of men 120 put their trust 2620-4 under the shadow 6738 of thy wings. 3671

36:8 They shall be abundantly satisfied 7301-4 with the fatness 1880 of thy house; 1004 and thou shalt make them drink 8248-55 of the river 5158 of thy pleasures. 5730

36:9 For with thee [is] the fountain 4726 of life: 2416 in thy light 216 shall we see 7200-4 light. 216

36:10 O continue 4900-3 thy lovingkindness 2617 unto them that know 3045-6 thee; and thy righteousness 6666 to the upright 3477 in heart. 3820

36:11 Let not the foot 7272 of pride 1346 come 935-4 against me, and let not the hand 3027 of the wicked 7563 remove 5110-55 me.

36:12 There are the workers 6466-6 of iniquity 205 fallen: 5307-1 they are cast down, 1760-27 and shall not be able 3201-1 to rise. 6965-2

37:1 <[A Psalm] of David.> 1732 Fret 2734-101 not thyself because of evildoers, 7489-56 neither be thou envious 7065-17 against the workers 6213-6 of iniquity. 5766

37:2 For they shall soon 4120 be cut down 5243-4 like the grass, 2682 and wither 5034-4 as the green 3418 herb. 1877

37:3 Trust 982-3 in the LORD, 3068 and do 6213-3 good; 2896 [so] shalt thou dwell 7931-3 in the land, 776 and verily 530 thou shalt be fed. 7462-3

37:4 Delight 6026-100 thyself also in the LORD; 3068 and he shall give 5414-4 thee the desires 4862 of thine heart. 3820

37:5 Commit 1556-3 thy way 1870 unto the LORD; 3068 trust 982-3 also in him; and he shall bring [it] to pass. 6213-4

37:6 And he shall bring forth 3318-52 thy righteousness 6664 as the light, 216 and thy judgment 4941 as the noonday. 6672

37:7 Rest 1826-3 in the LORD, 3068 and wait patiently 2342-112 for him: fret 2734-101 not thyself because of him who prospereth 6743-56 in his way, 1870 because of the man 376 who bringeth wicked devices 4209 to pass. 6213-6

37:8 Cease 7503-54 from anger, 639 and forsake 5800-3 wrath: 2534 fret 2734-101 not thyself in any wise 389 to do evil. 7489-53

37:9 For evildoers 7489-56 shall be cut off: 3772-11 but those that wait 6960-6 upon the LORD, 3068 they shall inherit 3423-4 the earth. 776

37:10 For yet a little while, 4592 and the wicked 7563 [shall] not [be]: yea, thou shalt diligently consider 995-110 his place, 4725 and it [shall] not [be].

37:11 But the meek 6035 shall inherit 3423-4 the earth; 776 and shall delight 6026-98 themselves in the abundance 7230 of peace. 7965

37:12 The wicked 7563 plotteth 2161-6 against the just, 6662 and gnasheth 2786-6 upon him with his teeth. 8127

37:13 The Lord 136 shall laugh 7832-4 at him: for he seeth 7200-1 that his day 3117 is coming. 935-4

37:14 The wicked 7563 have drawn out 6605-1 the sword, 2719 and have bent 1869-1 their bow, 7198 to cast down 5307-53 the poor 6041 and needy, 34 [and] to slay 2873-2 such as be of upright 3477 conversation. 1870

37:15 Their sword 2719 shall enter 935-4 into their own heart, 3820 and their bows 7198 shall be broken. 7665-11

37:16 A little 4592 that a righteous 6662 man hath [is] better 2896 than the riches 1995 of many 7227 wicked. 7563

37:17 For the arms 2220 of the wicked 7563 shall be broken: 7665-11 but the LORD 3068 upholdeth 5564-6 the righteous. 6662

37:18 The LORD 3068 knoweth 3045-6 the days 3117 of the upright: 8549 and their inheritance 5159 shall be for ever. 5769

37:19 They shall not be ashamed 954-4 in the evil 7451 time: 6256 and in the days 3117 of famine 7459 they shall be satisfied. 7646-4

37:20 But the wicked 7563 shall perish, 6-4 and the enemies 341-6 of the LORD 3068 [shall be] as the fat 3368 of lambs: 3733 they shall consume; 3615-1 into smoke 6227 shall they consume away. 3615-1

37:21 The wicked 7563 borroweth, 3867-5 and payeth 7999-17 not again: but the righteous 6662 sheweth mercy, 2603-6 and giveth. 5414-6

37:22 For [such as be] blessed 1288-30 of him shall inherit 3423-4 the earth; 776 and [they that be] cursed 7043-30 of him shall be cut off. 3772-11

37:23 The steps 4703 of a [good] man 1397 are ordered 3559-49 by the LORD: 3068 and he delighteth 2654-4 in his way. 1870

37:24 Though he fall, 5307-4 he shall not be utterly cast down: 2904-93 for the LORD 3068 upholdeth 5564-6 [him with] his hand. 3027

37:25 I have been young, 5288 and [now] am old; 2204-1 yet have I not seen 7200-1 the righteous 6662 forsaken, 5800-12 nor his seed 2233 begging 1245-18 bread. 3899

37:26 [He is] ever 3605 3117 merciful, 2603-6 and lendeth; 3867-56 and his seed 2233 [is] blessed. 1293

37:27 Depart 5493-3 from evil, 7451 and do 6213-3 good; 2896 and dwell 7931-3 for evermore. 5769

37:28 For the LORD 3068 loveth 157-6 judgment, 4941 and forsaketh 5800-4 not his saints; 2623 they are preserved 8104-8 for ever: 5769 but the seed 2233 of the wicked 7563 shall be cut off. 3772-8

37:29 The righteous 6662 shall inherit 3423-4 the land, 776 and dwell 7931-4 therein for ever. 5703

37:30 The mouth 6310 of the righteous 6662 speaketh 1897-4 wisdom, 2451 and his tongue 3956 talketh 1696-17 of judgment. 4941

37:31 The law 8451 of his God 430 [is] in his heart; 3820 none of his steps 838 shall slide. 4571-4

37:32 The wicked 7563 watcheth 6822-6 the righteous, 6662 and seeketh 1245-18 to slay 4191-53 him.

37:33 The LORD 3068 will not leave 5800-4 him in his hand, 3027 nor condemn 7561-55 him when he is judged. 8199-9

37:34 Wait 6960-16 on the LORD, 3068 and keep 8104-3 his way, 1870 and he shall exalt 7311-34 thee to inherit 3423-2 the land: 776 when the wicked 7563 are cut off, 3772-9 thou shalt see 7200-4 [it].

37:35 I have seen 7200-1 the wicked 7563 in great power, 6184 and spreading 6168-102 himself like a green 7488 bay tree. 249

37:36 Yet he passed away, 5674-4 and, lo, he [was] not: yea, I sought 1245-17 him, but he could not be found. 4672-8

37:37 Mark 8104-3 the perfect 8535 [man], and behold 7200-3 the upright: 3477 for the end 319 of [that] man 376 [is] peace. 7965

37:38 But the transgressors 6586-6 shall be destroyed 8045-8 together: 3162 the end 319 of the wicked 7563 shall be cut off. 3772-8

37:39 But the salvation 8668 of the righteous 6662 [is] of the LORD: 3068 [he is] their strength 4581 in the time 6256 of trouble. 6869

37:40 And the LORD 3068 shall help 5826-4 them, and deliver 6403-17 them: he shall deliver 6403-17 them from the wicked, 7563 and save 3467-55 them, because they trust 2620-1 in him.

38:1 <A Psalm 4210 of David, 1732 to bring to remembrance.> 2142-53 O LORD, 3068 rebuke 3198-55 me not in thy wrath: 7110 neither chasten 3256-17 me in thy hot displeasure. 2534

38:2 For thine arrows 2671 stick fast 5181-8 in me, and thy hand 3027 presseth me sore. 5181-4

38:3 [There is] no soundness 4974 in my flesh 1320 because 6440 of thine anger; 2195 neither [is there any] rest 7965 in my bones 6106 because 6440 of my sin. 2403

38:4 For mine iniquities 5771 are gone over 5674-1 mine head: 7218 as an heavy 3515 burden 4853 they are too heavy 3513-4 for me.

38:5 My wounds 2250 stink 887-52 [and] are corrupt 4743-8 because 6440 of my foolishness. 200

38:6 I am troubled; 5753-8 I am bowed down 7817-1 greatly; 3966 I go 1980-14 mourning 6937-6 all the day 3117 long.

38:7 For my loins 3689 are filled 4390-1 with a loathsome 7033-12 [disease]: and [there is] no soundness 4974 in my flesh. 1320

38:8 I am feeble 6313-8 and sore 3966 broken: 1794-8 I have roared 7580-1 by reason of the disquietness 5100 of my heart. 3820

38:9 Lord, 136 all my desire 8378 [is] before thee; and my groaning 585 is not hid 5641-8 from thee.

38:10 My heart 3820 panteth, 5503-43 my strength 3581 faileth 5800-1 me: as for the light 216 of mine eyes, 5869 it 1992 also is gone 369 from me.

38:11 My lovers 157-6 and my friends 7453 stand 5975-4 aloof from 5048 my sore; 5061 and my kinsmen 7138 stand 5975-1 afar off. 7350

38:12 They also that seek 1245-18 after my life 5315 lay snares 5367-17 [for me]: and they that seek 1875-6 my hurt 7451 speak 1696-14 mischievous things, 1942 and imagine 1897-4 deceits 4820 all the day 3117 long.

38:13 But I, as a deaf 2795 [man], heard 8085-4 not; and [I was] as a dumb man 483 [that] openeth 6605-4 not his mouth. 6310

38:14 Thus I was as a man 376 that heareth 8085-6 not, and in whose mouth 6310 [are] no reproofs. 8433

38:15 For in thee, O LORD, 3068 do I hope: 3176-52 thou wilt hear, 6030-4 O Lord 136 my God. 430

38:16 For I said, 559-1 [Hear me], lest [otherwise] they should rejoice 8055-4 over me: when my foot 7272 slippeth, 4131-2 they magnify 1431-52 [themselves] against me.

38:17 For I [am] ready 3559-12 to halt, 6761 and my sorrow 4341 [is] continually 8548 before me.

38:18 For I will declare 5046-55 mine iniquity; 5771 I will be sorry 1672-4 for my sin. 2403

38:19 But mine enemies 341-6 [are] lively, 2416 [and] they are strong: 6105-1 and they that hate 8130-6 me wrongfully 8267 are multiplied. 7231-1

38:20 They also that render 7999-18 evil 7451 for good 2896 are mine adversaries; 7853-4 because I follow 7291-2 [the thing that] good 2896 [is].

38:21 Forsake 5800-4 me not, O LORD: 3068 O my God, 430 be not far 7368-4 from me.

38:22 Make haste 2363-3 to help 5833 me, O Lord 136 my salvation. 8668

39:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 [even] to Jeduthun, 3038 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 I said, 559-1 I will take heed 8104-4 to my ways, 1870 that I sin 2398-2 not with my tongue: 3956 I will keep 8104-4 my mouth 6310 with a bridle, 4269 while the wicked 7563 is before me.

39:2 I was dumb 481-8 with silence, 1747 I held my peace, 2814-52 [even] from good; 2896 and my sorrow 3511 was stirred. 5916-8

39:3 My heart 3820 was hot 2552-1 within 7130 me, while I was musing 1901 the fire 784 burned: 1197-4 [then] 227 spake 1696-14 I with my tongue, 3956

39:4 LORD, 3068 make me to know 3045-54 mine end, 7093 and the measure 4060 of my days, 3117 what it [is; that] I may know 3045-4 how frail 2310 I [am].

39:5 Behold, thou hast made 5414-1 my days 3117 [as] an handbreadth; 2947 and mine age 2465 [is] as nothing before thee: verily every 3605 man 120 at his best state 5324-12 [is] altogether 3605 vanity. 1892 Selah. 5542

39:6 Surely every man 376 walketh 1980-101 in a vain shew: 6754 surely they are disquieted 1993-4 in vain: 1892 he heapeth up 6651-4 [riches], and knoweth 3045-4 not who shall gather 622-6 them.

39:7 And now, Lord, 136 what wait 6960-14 I for? my hope 8431 [is] in thee.

39:8 Deliver 5337-54 me from all my transgressions: 6588 make 7760-4 me not the reproach 2781 of the foolish. 5036

39:9 I was dumb, 481-8 I opened 6605-4 not my mouth; 6310 because thou didst 6213-1 [it].

39:10 Remove thy stroke 5061 away 5493-54 from me: I am consumed 3615-1 by the blow 8409 of thine hand. 3027

39:11 When thou with rebukes 8433 dost correct 3256-14 man 376 for iniquity, 5771 thou makest his beauty 2530-7 to consume away 4529-55 like a moth: 6211 surely every man 120 [is] vanity. 1892 Selah. 5542

39:12 Hear 8085-3 my prayer, 8605 O LORD, 3068 and give ear 238-54 unto my cry; 7775 hold not thy peace 2790-4 at my tears: 1832 for I [am] a stranger 1616 with thee, [and] a sojourner, 8453 as all my fathers 1 [were].

39:13 O spare 8159-54 me, that I may recover strength, 1082-55 before I go 3212-4 hence, and be no more. 369

40:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 I waited 6960-14 patiently 6960-15 for the LORD; 3068 and he inclined 5186-4 unto me, and heard 8085-4 my cry. 7775

40:2 He brought me up 5927-55 also out of an horrible 7588 pit, 953 out of the miry 3121 clay, 2916 and set 6965-55 my feet 7272 upon a rock, 5553 [and] established 3559-31 my goings. 838

40:3 And he hath put 5414-4 a new 2319 song 7892 in my mouth, 6310 [even] praise 8416 unto our God: 430 many 7227 shall see 7200-4 [it], and fear, 3372-4 and shall trust 982-4 in the LORD. 3068

40:4 Blessed 835 [is] that man 1397 that maketh 7760-1 the LORD 3068 his trust, 4009 and respecteth 6437-1 not the proud, 7295 nor such as turn aside 7750-6 to lies. 3577

40:5 Many, 7227 O LORD 3068 my God, 430 [are] thy wonderful works 6381-12 [which] thou hast done, 6213-1 and thy thoughts 4284 [which are] to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order 6186-2 unto thee: [if] I would declare 5046-55 and speak 1696-17 [of them], they are more 6105-1 than can be numbered. 5608-15

40:6 Sacrifice 2077 and offering 4503 thou didst not desire; 2654-1 mine ears 241 hast thou opened: 3738-1 burnt offering 5930 and sin offering 2401 hast thou not required. 7592-1

40:7 Then said 559-1 I, Lo, I come: 935-1 in the volume 4039 of the book 5612 [it is] written 3789-7 of me,

40:8 I delight 2654-1 to do 6213-2 thy will, 7522 O my God: 430 yea, thy law 8451 [is] within 8432 my heart. 4578

40:9 I have preached 1319-14 righteousness 6664 in the great 7227 congregation: 6951 lo, I have not refrained 3607-4 my lips, 8193 O LORD, 3068 thou knowest. 3045-1

40:10 I have not hid 3680-14 thy righteousness 6666 within 8432 my heart; 3820 I have declared 559-1 thy faithfulness 530 and thy salvation: 8668 I have not concealed 3582-14 thy lovingkindness 2617 and thy truth 571 from the great 7227 congregation. 6951

40:11 Withhold 3607-4 not thou thy tender mercies 7356 from me, O LORD: 3068 let thy lovingkindness 2617 and thy truth 571 continually 8548 preserve 5341-4 me.

40:12 For innumerable 369 4557 evils 7451 have compassed 661-1 me about: mine iniquities 5771 have taken hold 5381-52 upon me, so that I am not able 3201-1 to look up; 7200-2 they are more 6105-1 than the hairs 8185 of mine head: 7218 therefore my heart 3820 faileth 5800-1 me.

40:13 Be pleased, 7521-3 O LORD, 3068 to deliver 5337-53 me: O LORD, 3068 make haste 2363-3 to help 5833 me.

40:14 Let them be ashamed 954-4 and confounded 2659-4 together 3162 that seek 1245-18 after my soul 5315 to destroy 5595-2 it; let them be driven 5472-11 backward 268 and put to shame 3637-11 that wish 2655 me evil. 7451

40:15 Let them be desolate 8074-4 for a reward 6118 of their shame 1322 that say 559-6 unto me, Aha, 1889 aha. 1889

40:16 Let all those that seek 1245-18 thee rejoice 7797-4 and be glad 8055-4 in thee: let such as love 157-6 thy salvation 8668 say 559-4 continually, 8548 The LORD 3068 be magnified. 1431-4

40:17 But I [am] poor 6041 and needy; 34 [yet] the Lord 136 thinketh 2803-4 upon me: thou [art] my help 5833 and my deliverer; 6403-18 make no tarrying, 309-17 O my God. 430

41:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 Blessed 835 [is] he that considereth 7919-56 the poor: 1800 the LORD 3068 will deliver 4422-17 him in time 3117 of trouble. 7451

41:2 The LORD 3068 will preserve 8104-4 him, and keep him alive; 2421-17 [and] he shall be blessed 833-27 upon the earth: 776 and thou wilt not deliver 5414-4 him unto the will 5315 of his enemies. 341-6

41:3 The LORD 3068 will strengthen 5582-4 him upon the bed 6210 of languishing: 1741 thou wilt make 2015-1 all his bed 4904 in his sickness. 2483

41:4 I said, 559-1 LORD, 3068 be merciful 2603-3 unto me: heal 7495-3 my soul; 5315 for I have sinned 2398-1 against thee.

41:5 Mine enemies 341-6 speak 559-4 evil 7451 of me, When shall he die, 4191-4 and his name 8034 perish? 6-1

41:6 And if he come 935-1 to see 7200-2 [me], he speaketh 1696-17 vanity: 7723 his heart 3820 gathereth 6908-4 iniquity 205 to itself; [when] he goeth 3318-4 abroad, 2351 he telleth 1696-17 [it].

41:7 All that hate 8130-6 me whisper 3907-101 together 3162 against me: against me do they devise 2803-4 my hurt. 7451

41:8 An evil 1100 disease, 1697 [say they], cleaveth fast 3332-7 unto him: and [now] that he lieth 7901-1 he shall rise up 6965-2 no more. 3254-55

41:9 Yea, mine own familiar 7965 friend, 376 in whom I trusted, 982-1 which did eat 398-6 of my bread, 3899 hath lifted up 1431-52 [his] heel 6119 against me.

41:10 But thou, O LORD, 3068 be merciful 2603-3 unto me, and raise me up, 6965-54 that I may requite 7999-17 them.

41:11 By this I know 3045-1 that thou favourest 2654-1 me, because mine enemy 341-6 doth not triumph 7321-55 over me.

41:12 And as for me, thou upholdest 8551-1 me in mine integrity, 8537 and settest 5324-55 me before thy face 6440 for ever. 5769

41:13 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 from everlasting, 5769 and to everlasting. 5769 Amen, 543 and Amen. 543

42:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 Maschil, 4905|7919-56 for the sons 1121 of Korah.> 7141 As the hart 354 panteth 6165-4 after the water 4325 brooks, 650 so panteth 6165-4 my soul 5315 after thee, O God. 430

42:2 My soul 5315 thirsteth 6770-1 for God, 430 for the living 2416 God: 410 when shall I come 935-4 and appear 7200-11 before 6440 God? 430

42:3 My tears 1832 have been my meat 3899 day 3119 and night, 3915 while they continually 3605 3117 say 559-2 unto me, Where [is] thy God? 430

42:4 When I remember 2142-4 these [things], I pour out 8210-4 my soul 5315 in me: for I had gone 5674-4 with the multitude, 5519 I went 1718-101 with them to the house 1004 of God, 430 with the voice 6963 of joy 7440 and praise, 8426 with a multitude 1995 that kept holyday. 2287-6

42:5 Why art thou cast down, 7817-113 O my soul? 5315 and [why] art thou disquieted 1993-4 in me? hope 3176-54 thou in God: 430 for I shall yet praise 3034-55 him [for] the help 3444 of his countenance. 6440

42:6 O my God, 430 my soul 5315 is cast down 7817-113 within me: therefore will I remember 2142-4 thee from the land 776 of Jordan, 3383 and of the Hermonites, 2769 from the hill 2022 Mizar. 4706|4705

42:7 Deep 8415 calleth 7121-6 unto deep 8415 at the noise 6963 of thy waterspouts: 6794 all thy waves 4867 and thy billows 1530 are gone 5674-1 over me.

42:8 [Yet] the LORD 3068 will command 6680-17 his lovingkindness 2617 in the daytime, 3119 and in the night 3915 his song 7892 [shall be] with me, [and] my prayer 8605 unto the God 410 of my life. 2416

42:9 I will say 559-4 unto God 410 my rock, 5553 Why hast thou forgotten 7911-1 me? why go 3212-4 I mourning 6937-6 because of the oppression 3906 of the enemy? 341-6

42:10 [As] with a sword 7524 in my bones, 6106 mine enemies 6887-6 reproach 2778-14 me; while they say 559-2 daily 3605 3117 unto me, Where [is] thy God? 430

42:11 Why art thou cast down, 7817-113 O my soul? 5315 and why art thou disquieted 1993-4 within me? hope 3176-54 thou in God: 430 for I shall yet praise 3034-55 him, [who is] the health 3444 of my countenance, 6440 and my God. 430

43:1 Judge 8199-3 me, O God, 430 and plead 7378-3 my cause 7379 against an ungodly 3808 2623 nation: 1471 O deliver 6403-17 me from the deceitful 4820 and unjust 5766 man. 376

43:2 For thou [art] the God 430 of my strength: 4581 why dost thou cast me off? 2186-1 why go 1980-101 I mourning 6937-6 because of the oppression 3906 of the enemy? 341-6

43:3 O send out 7971-3 thy light 216 and thy truth: 571 let them lead 5148-55 me; let them bring 935-55 me unto thy holy 6944 hill, 2022 and to thy tabernacles. 4908

43:4 Then will I go 935-4 unto the altar 4196 of God, 430 unto God 410 my exceeding 8057 joy: 1524 yea, upon the harp 3658 will I praise 3034-55 thee, O God 430 my God. 430

43:5 Why art thou cast down, 7817-113 O my soul? 5315 and why art thou disquieted 1993-4 within me? hope 3176-54 in God: 430 for I shall yet praise 3034-55 him, [who is] the health 3444 of my countenance, 6440 and my God. 430

44:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 for the sons 1121 of Korah, 7141 Maschil.> 4905|7919-56 We have heard 8085-1 with our ears, 241 O God, 430 our fathers 1 have told 5608-14 us, [what] work 6467 thou didst 6466-1 in their days, 3117 in the times 3117 of old. 6924

44:2 [How] thou didst drive out 3423-52 the heathen 1471 with thy hand, 3027 and plantedst 5193-4 them; [how] thou didst afflict 7489-55 the people, 3816 and cast them out. 7971-17

44:3 For they got not the land 776 in possession 3423-1 by their own sword, 2719 neither did their own arm 2220 save 3467-52 them: but thy right hand, 3225 and thine arm, 2220 and the light 216 of thy countenance, 6440 because thou hadst a favour 7521-1 unto them.

44:4 Thou art my King, 4428 O God: 430 command 6680-16 deliverances 3444 for Jacob. 3290

44:5 Through thee will we push down 5055-17 our enemies: 6862 through thy name 8034 will we tread them under 947-4 that rise up 6965-5 against us.

44:6 For I will not trust 982-4 in my bow, 7198 neither shall my sword 2719 save 3467-55 me.

44:7 But thou hast saved 3467-52 us from our enemies, 6862 and hast put them to shame 954-52 that hated 8130-18 us.

44:8 In God 430 we boast 1984-14 all the day 3117 long, and praise 3034-55 thy name 8034 for ever. 5769 Selah. 5542

44:9 But 637 thou hast cast off, 2186-1 and put us to shame; 3637-55 and goest not forth 3318-4 with our armies. 6635

44:10 Thou makest us to turn 7725-55 back 268 from the enemy: 6862 and they which hate 8130-18 us spoil 8154-1 for themselves.

44:11 Thou hast given 5414-4 us like sheep 6629 [appointed] for meat; 3978 and hast scattered 2219-14 us among the heathen. 1471

44:12 Thou sellest 4376-4 thy people 5971 for nought, 1952 and dost not increase 7235-14 [thy wealth] by their price. 4242

44:13 Thou makest 7760-4 us a reproach 2781 to our neighbours, 7934 a scorn 3933 and a derision 7047 to them that are round about 5439 us.

44:14 Thou makest 7760-4 us a byword 4912 among the heathen, 1471 a shaking 4493 of the head 7218 among the people. 3816

44:15 My confusion 3639 [is] continually 3605 3117 before me, and the shame 1322 of my face 6440 hath covered 3680-14 me,

44:16 For the voice 6963 of him that reproacheth 2778-18 and blasphemeth; 1442-18 by reason 6440 of the enemy 341-6 and avenger. 5358-102

44:17 All this is come upon us; 935-1 yet have we not forgotten 7911-1 thee, neither have we dealt falsely 8266-14 in thy covenant. 1285

44:18 Our heart 3820 is not turned 5472-8 back, 268 neither have our steps 838 declined 5186-4 from thy way; 734

44:19 Though thou hast sore broken 1794-14 us in the place 4725 of dragons, 8577 and covered 3680-17 us with the shadow of death. 6757

44:20 If we have forgotten 7911-1 the name 8034 of our God, 430 or stretched out 6566-4 our hands 3709 to a strange 2114-5 god; 410

44:21 Shall not God 430 search this out? 2713-4 for he knoweth 3045-6 the secrets 8587 of the heart. 3820

44:22 Yea, for thy sake are we killed 2026-27 all the day 3117 long; we are counted 2803-8 as sheep 6629 for the slaughter. 2878

44:23 Awake, 5782-3 why sleepest 3462-4 thou, O Lord? 136 arise, 6974-54 cast [us] not off 2186-4 for ever. 5331

44:24 Wherefore hidest 5641-55 thou thy face, 6440 [and] forgettest 7911-4 our affliction 6040 and our oppression? 3906

44:25 For our soul 5315 is bowed down 7743-1 to the dust: 6083 our belly 990 cleaveth 1692-1 unto the earth. 776

44:26 Arise 6965-3 for our help, 5833 and redeem 6299-3 us for thy mercies' 2617 sake.

45:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 upon Shoshannim, 7799 for the sons 1121 of Korah, 7141 Maschil, 4905|7919-56 A Song 7892 of loves.> 3039 My heart 3820 is inditing 7370-1 a good 2896 matter: 1697 I speak 559-6 of the things which I have made 4639 touching the king: 4428 my tongue 3956 [is] the pen 5842 of a ready 4106 writer. 5608-6

45:2 Thou art fairer 3302-27 than the children 1121 of men: 120 grace 2580 is poured 3332-90 into thy lips: 8193 therefore God 430 hath blessed 1288-14 thee for ever. 5769

45:3 Gird 2296-3 thy sword 2719 upon [thy] thigh, 3409 O [most] mighty, 1368 with thy glory 1935 and thy majesty. 1926

45:4 And in thy majesty 1926 ride 7392-3 prosperously 6743-3 because 1697 of truth 571 and meekness 6037 [and] righteousness; 6664 and thy right hand 3225 shall teach 3384-55 thee terrible things. 3372-12

45:5 Thine arrows 2671 [are] sharp 8150-6 in the heart 3820 of the king's 4428 enemies; 341-6 [whereby] the people 5971 fall 5307-4 under thee.

45:6 Thy throne, 3678 O God, 430 [is] for ever 5769 and ever: 5703 the sceptre 7626 of thy kingdom 4438 [is] a right 4334 sceptre. 7626

45:7 Thou lovest 157-1 righteousness, 6664 and hatest 8130-4 wickedness: 7562 therefore God, 430 thy God, 430 hath anointed 4886-1 thee with the oil 8081 of gladness 8342 above thy fellows. 2270

45:8 All thy garments 899 [smell] of myrrh, 4753 and aloes, 174 [and] cassia, 7102 out of the ivory 8127 palaces, 1964 whereby 4482 they have made thee glad. 8055-14

45:9 Kings' 4428 daughters 1323 [were] among thy honourable women: 3368 upon thy right hand 3225 did stand 5324-8 the queen 7694 in gold 3800 of Ophir. 211

45:10 Hearken, 8085-3 O daughter, 1323 and consider, 7200-3 and incline 5186-54 thine ear; 241 forget 7911-3 also thine own people, 5971 and thy father's 1 house; 1004

45:11 So shall the king 4428 greatly desire 183-101 thy beauty: 3308 for he [is] thy Lord; 113 and worship 7812-100 thou him.

45:12 And the daughter 1323 of Tyre 6865 [shall be there] with a gift; 4503 [even] the rich 6223 among the people 5971 shall intreat 2470-17 thy favour. 6440

45:13 The king's 4428 daughter 1323 [is] all glorious 3520 within: 6441 her clothing 3830 [is] of wrought 4865 gold. 2091

45:14 She shall be brought 2986-93 unto the king 4428 in raiment of needlework: 7553 the virgins 1330 her companions 7464 that follow 310 her shall be brought 935-94 unto thee.

45:15 With gladness 8057 and rejoicing 1524 shall they be brought: 2986-93 they shall enter 935-4 into the king's 4428 palace. 1964

45:16 Instead of thy fathers 1 shall be thy children, 1121 whom thou mayest make 7896-4 princes 8269 in all the earth. 776

45:17 I will make thy name 8034 to be remembered 2142-55 in all 1755 generations: 1755 therefore shall the people 5971 praise 3034-55 thee for ever 5769 and ever. 5703

46:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 for the sons 1121 of Korah, 7141 A Song 7892 upon Alamoth.> 5961 God 430 [is] our refuge 4268 and strength, 5797 a very 3966 present 4672-8 help 5833 in trouble. 6869

46:2 Therefore will not we fear, 3372-4 though the earth 776 be removed, 4171-53 and though the mountains 2022 be carried 4131-2 into the midst 3820 of the sea; 3220

46:3 [Though] the waters 4325 thereof roar 1993-4 [and] be troubled, 2560-4 [though] the mountains 2022 shake 7493-4 with the swelling 1346 thereof. Selah. 5542

46:4 [There is] a river, 5104 the streams 6388 whereof shall make glad 8055-17 the city 5892 of God, 430 the holy 6918 [place] of the tabernacles 4908 of the most High. 5945

46:5 God 430 [is] in the midst 7130 of her; she shall not be moved: 4131-11 God 430 shall help 5826-4 her, [and that] right 6437-2 early. 1242

46:6 The heathen 1471 raged, 1993-1 the kingdoms 4467 were moved: 4131-1 he uttered 5414-1 his voice, 6963 the earth 776 melted. 4127-4

46:7 The LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 [is] with us; the God 430 of Jacob 3290 [is] our refuge. 4869 Selah. 5542

46:8 Come, 3212-3 behold 2372-3 the works 4659 of the LORD, 3068 what desolations 8047 he hath made 7760-1 in the earth. 776

46:9 He maketh wars 4421 to cease 7673-56 unto the end 7097 of the earth; 776 he breaketh 7665-17 the bow, 7198 and cutteth the spear 2595 in sunder; 7112-14 he burneth 8313-4 the chariot 5699 in the fire. 784

46:10 Be still, 7503-54 and know 3045-3 that I [am] God: 430 I will be exalted 7311-4 among the heathen, 1471 I will be exalted 7311-4 in the earth. 776

46:11 The LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 [is] with us; the God 430 of Jacob 3290 [is] our refuge. 4869 Selah. 5542

47:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 A Psalm 4210 for the sons 1121 of Korah.> 7141 O clap 8628-3 your hands, 3709 all ye people; 5971 shout 7321-54 unto God 430 with the voice 6963 of triumph. 7440

47:2 For the LORD 3068 most high 5945 [is] terrible; 3372-12 [he is] a great 1419 King 4428 over all the earth. 776

47:3 He shall subdue 1696-55 the people 5971 under us, and the nations 3816 under our feet. 7272

47:4 He shall choose 977-4 our inheritance 5159 for us, the excellency 1347 of Jacob 3290 whom he loved. 157-1 Selah. 5542

47:5 God 430 is gone up 5927-1 with a shout, 8643 the LORD 3068 with the sound 6963 of a trumpet. 7782

47:6 Sing praises 2167-16 to God, 430 sing praises: 2167-16 sing praises 2167-16 unto our King, 4428 sing praises. 2167-16

47:7 For God 430 [is] the King 4428 of all the earth: 776 sing ye praises 2167-16 with understanding. 7919-56

47:8 God 430 reigneth 4427-1 over the heathen: 1471 God 430 sitteth 3427-1 upon the throne 3678 of his holiness. 6944

47:9 The princes 5081 of the people 5971 are gathered 622-8 together, [even] the people 5971 of the God 430 of Abraham: 85 for the shields 4043 of the earth 776 [belong] unto God: 430 he is greatly 3966 exalted. 5927-8

48:1 <A Song 7892 [and] Psalm 4210 for the sons 1121 of Korah.> 7141 Great 1419 [is] the LORD, 3068 and greatly 3966 to be praised 1984-30 in the city 5892 of our God, 430 [in] the mountain 2022 of his holiness. 6944

48:2 Beautiful 3303 for situation, 5131 the joy 4885 of the whole earth, 776 [is] mount 2022 Zion, 6726 [on] the sides 3411 of the north, 6828 the city 7151 of the great 7227 King. 4428

48:3 God 430 is known 3045-8 in her palaces 759 for a refuge. 4869

48:4 For, lo, the kings 4428 were assembled, 3259-8 they passed by 5674-1 together. 3162

48:5 They saw 7200-1 [it, and] so they marvelled; 8539-1 they were troubled, 926-8 [and] hasted away. 2648-8

48:6 Fear 7461 took hold upon them 270-1 there, [and] pain, 2427 as of a woman in travail. 3205-6

48:7 Thou breakest 7665-17 the ships 591 of Tarshish 8659 with an east 6921 wind. 7307

48:8 As we have heard, 8085-1 so have we seen 7200-1 in the city 5892 of the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 in the city 5892 of our God: 430 God 430 will establish 3559-34 it for 5704 ever. 5769 Selah. 5542

48:9 We have thought 1819-14 of thy lovingkindness, 2617 O God, 430 in the midst 7130 of thy temple. 1964

48:10 According to thy name, 8034 O God, 430 so [is] thy praise 8416 unto the ends 7099 of the earth: 776 thy right hand 3225 is full 4390-1 of righteousness. 6664

48:11 Let mount 2022 Zion 6726 rejoice, 8055-4 let the daughters 1323 of Judah 3063 be glad, 1523-4 because of thy judgments. 4941

48:12 Walk about 5437-3 Zion, 6726 and go round about 5362-54 her: tell 5608-3 the towers 4026 thereof.

48:13 Mark 7896-3 ye well 3820 her bulwarks, 2430 consider 6448-16 her palaces; 759 that ye may tell 5608-17 [it] to the generation 1755 following. 314

48:14 For this God 430 [is] our God 430 for ever 5769 and ever: 5703 he will be our guide 5090-17 [even] unto death. 4192

49:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 A Psalm 4210 for the sons 1121 of Korah.> 7141 Hear 8085-3 this, all [ye] people; 5971 give ear, 238-54 all [ye] inhabitants 3427-6 of the world: 2465

49:2 Both low 1121 120 and high, 1121 376 rich 6223 and poor, 34 together. 3162

49:3 My mouth 6310 shall speak 1696-17 of wisdom; 2454 and the meditation 1900 of my heart 3820 [shall be] of understanding. 8394

49:4 I will incline 5186-55 mine ear 241 to a parable: 4912 I will open 6605-4 my dark saying 2420 upon the harp. 3658

49:5 Wherefore should I fear 3372-4 in the days 3117 of evil, 7451 [when] the iniquity 5771 of my heels 6120 shall compass me about? 5437-4

49:6 They that trust 982-6 in their wealth, 2428 and boast 1984-101 themselves in the multitude 7230 of their riches; 6239

49:7 None [of them] can 376 by any means 6299-2 redeem 6299-4 his brother, 251 nor give 5414-4 to God 430 a ransom 3724 for him:

49:8 (For the redemption 6306 of their soul 5315 [is] precious, 3365-4 and it ceaseth 2308-1 for ever:) 5769

49:9 That he should still live 2421-4 for ever, 5331 [and] not see 7200-4 corruption. 7845

49:10 For he seeth 7200-4 [that] wise men 2450 die, 4191-4 likewise 3162 the fool 3684 and the brutish person 1198 perish, 6-4 and leave 5800-1 their wealth 2428 to others. 312

49:11 Their inward 7130 thought [is, that] their houses 1004 [shall continue] for ever, 5769 [and] their dwelling places 4908 to all 1755 generations; 1755 they call 7121-1 [their] lands 127 after their own names. 8034

49:12 Nevertheless man 120 [being] in honour 3366 abideth 3885-4 not: he is like 4911-8 the beasts 929 [that] perish. 1820-8

49:13 This their way 1870 [is] their folly: 3689 yet their posterity 310 approve 7521-4 their sayings. 6310 Selah. 5542

49:14 Like sheep 6629 they are laid 8371-1 in the grave; 7585 death 4194 shall feed 7462-4 on them; and the upright 3477 shall have dominion 7287-4 over them in the morning; 1242 and their beauty 6697|6736-k shall consume 1086-15 in the grave 7585 from their dwelling. 2073

49:15 But God 430 will redeem 6299-4 my soul 5315 from the power 3027 of the grave: 7585 for he shall receive 3947-4 me. Selah. 5542

49:16 Be not thou afraid 3372-4 when one 376 is made rich, 6238-55 when the glory 3519 of his house 1004 is increased; 7235-4

49:17 For when he dieth 4194 he shall carry nothing away: 3947-4 his glory 3519 shall not descend 3381-4 after 310 him.

49:18 Though while he lived 2416 he blessed 1288-17 his soul: 5315 and [men] will praise 3034-55 thee, when thou doest well 3190-55 to thyself.

49:19 He shall go 935-4 to the generation 1755 of his fathers; 1 they shall never 3808 5331 see 7200-4 light. 216

49:20 Man 120 [that is] in honour, 3366 and understandeth 995-4 not, is like 4911-8 the beasts 929 [that] perish. 1820-8

50:1 <A Psalm 4210 of Asaph.> 623 The mighty 410 God, 430 [even] the LORD, 3068 hath spoken, 1696-14 and called 7121-4 the earth 776 from the rising 4217 of the sun 8121 unto the going down 3996 thereof.

50:2 Out of Zion, 6726 the perfection 4359 of beauty, 3308 God 430 hath shined. 3313-52

50:3 Our God 430 shall come, 935-4 and shall not keep silence: 2790-4 a fire 784 shall devour 398-4 before 6440 him, and it shall be very 3966 tempestuous 8175-8 round about 5439 him.

50:4 He shall call 7121-4 to the heavens 8064 from above, 5920 and to the earth, 776 that he may judge 1777-2 his people. 5971

50:5 Gather 622-3 my saints 2623 together unto me; those that have made 3772-6 a covenant 1285 with me by sacrifice. 2077

50:6 And the heavens 8064 shall declare 5046-55 his righteousness: 6664 for God 430 [is] judge 8199-6 himself. Selah. 5542

50:7 Hear, 8085-3 O my people, 5971 and I will speak; 1696-17 O Israel, 3478 and I will testify 5749-55 against thee: I [am] God, 430 [even] thy God. 430

50:8 I will not reprove 3198-55 thee for thy sacrifices 2077 or thy burnt offerings, 5930 [to have been] continually 8548 before me.

50:9 I will take 3947-4 no bullock 6499 out of thy house, 1004 [nor] he goats 6260 out of thy folds. 4356

50:10 For every beast 2416 of the forest 3293 [is] mine, [and] the cattle 929 upon a thousand 505 hills. 2042

50:11 I know 3045-1 all the fowls 5775 of the mountains: 2022 and the wild beasts 2123 of the field 7704 [are] mine. 5978

50:12 If I were hungry, 7456-4 I would not tell 559-4 thee: for the world 8398 [is] mine, and the fulness 4393 thereof.

50:13 Will I eat 398-4 the flesh 1320 of bulls, 47 or drink 8354-4 the blood 1818 of goats? 6260

50:14 Offer 2076-3 unto God 430 thanksgiving; 8426 and pay 7999-16 thy vows 5088 unto the most High: 5945

50:15 And call 7121-3 upon me in the day 3117 of trouble: 6869 I will deliver 2502-17 thee, and thou shalt glorify 3513-17 me.

50:16 But unto the wicked 7563 God 430 saith, 559-1 What hast thou to do to declare 5608-15 my statutes, 2706 or [that] thou shouldest take 5375-4 my covenant 1285 in thy mouth? 6310

50:17 Seeing thou hatest 8130-1 instruction, 4148 and castest 7993-55 my words 1697 behind 310 thee.

50:18 When thou sawest 7200-1 a thief, 1590 then thou consentedst 7521-4 with him, and hast been partaker 2506 with adulterers. 5003-18

50:19 Thou givest 7971-1 thy mouth 6310 to evil, 7451 and thy tongue 3956 frameth 6775-55 deceit. 4820

50:20 Thou sittest 3427-4 [and] speakest 1696-17 against thy brother; 251 thou 5414-4 slanderest 1848 thine own mother's 517 son. 1121

50:21 These [things] hast thou done, 6213-1 and I kept silence; 2790-52 thou thoughtest 1819-14 that I was altogether 1961-2 [such an one] as thyself: [but] I will reprove 3198-55 thee, and set [them] in order 6186-4 before thine eyes. 5869

50:22 Now consider 995-3 this, ye that forget 7911-6 God, 433 lest I tear [you] in pieces, 2963-4 and [there be] none to deliver. 5337-56

50:23 Whoso offereth 2076-6 praise 8426 glorifieth 3513-17 me: and to him that ordereth 7760-1 [his] conversation 1870 [aright] will I shew 7200-55 the salvation 3468 of God. 430

51:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 A Psalm 4210 of David, 1732 when Nathan 5416 the prophet 5030 came 935-2 unto him, after he had gone in 935-1 to Bathsheba.> 1339 Have mercy 2603-3 upon me, O God, 430 according to thy lovingkindness: 2617 according unto the multitude 7230 of thy tender mercies 7356 blot out 4229-3 my transgressions. 6588

51:2 Wash 3526-16 me throughly 7235-54 from mine iniquity, 5771 and cleanse 2891-16 me from my sin. 2403

51:3 For I acknowledge 3045-4 my transgressions: 6588 and my sin 2403 [is] ever 8548 before me.

51:4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, 2398-1 and done 6213-1 [this] evil 7451 in thy sight: 5869 that thou mightest be justified 6663-4 when thou speakest, 1696-2 [and] be clear 2135-4 when thou judgest. 8199-2

51:5 Behold, I was shapen 2342-49 in iniquity; 5771 and in sin 2399 did my mother 517 conceive 3179-14 me.

51:6 Behold, thou desirest 2654-1 truth 571 in the inward parts: 2910 and in the hidden 5640-7 [part] thou shalt make me to know 3045-55 wisdom. 2451

51:7 Purge 2398-17 me with hyssop, 231 and I shall be clean: 2891-4 wash 3526-17 me, and I shall be whiter 3835-55 than snow. 7950

51:8 Make me to hear 8085-55 joy 8342 and gladness; 8057 [that] the bones 6106 [which] thou hast broken 1794-14 may rejoice. 1523-4

51:9 Hide 5641-54 thy face 6440 from my sins, 2399 and blot out 4229-3 all mine iniquities. 5771

51:10 Create 1254-3 in me a clean 2889 heart, 3820 O God; 430 and renew 2318-16 a right 3559-12 spirit 7307 within 7130 me.

51:11 Cast me not away 7993-55 from thy presence; 6440 and take 3947-4 not thy holy 6944 spirit 7307 from me.

51:12 Restore 7725-54 unto me the joy 8342 of thy salvation; 3468 and uphold 5564-4 me [with thy] free 5081 spirit. 7307

51:13 [Then] will I teach 3925-17 transgressors 6586-6 thy ways; 1870 and sinners 2400 shall be converted 7725-4 unto thee.

51:14 Deliver 5337-54 me from bloodguiltiness, 1818 O God, 430 thou God 430 of my salvation: 8668 [and] my tongue 3956 shall sing aloud 7442-17 of thy righteousness. 6666

51:15 O Lord, 136 open 6605-4 thou my lips; 8193 and my mouth 6310 shall shew forth 5046-55 thy praise. 8416

51:16 For thou desirest 2654-4 not sacrifice; 2077 else would I give 5414-4 [it]: thou delightest 7521-4 not in burnt offering. 5930

51:17 The sacrifices 2077 of God 430 [are] a broken 7665-12 spirit: 7307 a broken 7665-12 and a contrite 1794-12 heart, 3820 O God, 430 thou wilt not despise. 959-4

51:18 Do good 3190-54 in thy good pleasure 7522 unto Zion: 6726 build 1129-4 thou the walls 2346 of Jerusalem. 3389

51:19 Then shalt thou be pleased 2654-4 with the sacrifices 2077 of righteousness, 6664 with burnt offering 5930 and whole 3632 burnt offering: then shall they offer 5927-55 bullocks 6499 upon thine altar. 4196

52:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 Maschil, 4905|7919-56 [A Psalm] of David, 1732 when Doeg 1673 the Edomite 130 came 935-2 and told 5046-55 Saul, 7586 and said 559-4 unto him, David 1732 is come 935-1 to the house 1004 of Ahimelech.> 288 Why boastest 1984-101 thou thyself in mischief, 7451 O mighty 1368 man? the goodness 2617 of God 410 [endureth] continually. 3605 3117

52:2 Thy tongue 3956 deviseth 2803-4 mischiefs; 1942 like a sharp 3913-30 razor, 8593 working 6213-6 deceitfully. 7423

52:3 Thou lovest 157-1 evil 7451 more than good; 2896 [and] lying 8267 rather than to speak 1696-15 righteousness. 6664 Selah. 5542

52:4 Thou lovest 157-1 all devouring 1105 words, 1697 O [thou] deceitful 4820 tongue. 3956

52:5 God 410 shall likewise destroy 5422-4 thee for ever, 5331 he shall take thee away, 2846-4 and pluck thee 5255-4 out of [thy] dwelling place, 168 and root thee out 8327-14 of the land 776 of the living. 2416 Selah. 5542

52:6 The righteous 6662 also shall see, 7200-4 and fear, 3372-4 and shall laugh 7832-4 at him:

52:7 Lo, [this is] the man 1397 [that] made 7760-4 not God 430 his strength; 4581 but trusted 982-4 in the abundance 7230 of his riches, 6239 [and] strengthened 5810-4 himself in his wickedness. 1942

52:8 But I [am] like a green 7488 olive tree 2132 in the house 1004 of God: 430 I trust 982-1 in the mercy 2617 of God 430 for ever 5769 and ever. 5703

52:9 I will praise 3034-55 thee for ever, 5769 because thou hast done 6213-1 [it]: and I will wait 6960-17 on thy name; 8034 for [it is] good 2896 before thy saints. 2623

53:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 upon Mahalath, 4257 Maschil, 4905|7919-56 [A Psalm] of David.> 1732 The fool 5036 hath said 559-1 in his heart, 3820 [There is] no God. 430 Corrupt 7843-52 are they, and have done abominable 8581-52 iniquity: 5766 [there is] none that doeth 6213-6 good. 2896

53:2 God 430 looked down 8259-52 from heaven 8064 upon the children 1121 of men, 120 to see 7200-2 if there were 3426 [any] that did understand, 7919-56 that did seek 1875-6 God. 430

53:3 Every one of them is gone back: 5472-1 they are altogether 3162 become filthy; 444-8 [there is] none that doeth 6213-6 good, 2896 no, not one. 259

53:4 Have the workers 6466-6 of iniquity 205 no knowledge? 3045-1 who eat up 398-6 my people 5971 [as] they eat 398-1 bread: 3899 they have not called 7121-1 upon God. 430

53:5 There were they in great 6343 fear, 6342-1 [where] no fear 6343 was: for God 430 hath scattered 6340-14 the bones 6106 of him that encampeth 2583-6 [against] thee: thou hast put [them] to shame, 954-52 because God 430 hath despised 3988-1 them.

53:6 Oh that 5414-4 the salvation 3444 of Israel 3478 [were come] out of Zion! 6726 When God 430 bringeth back 7725-2 the captivity 7622 of his people, 5971 Jacob 3290 shall rejoice, 1523-4 [and] Israel 3478 shall be glad. 8055-4

54:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 on Neginoth, 5058 Maschil, 4905|7919-56 [A Psalm] of David, 1732 when the Ziphims 2130 came 935-2 and said 559-4 to Saul, 7586 Doth not David 1732 hide 5641-102 himself with us?> Save 3467-54 me, O God, 430 by thy name, 8034 and judge 1777-4 me by thy strength. 1369

54:2 Hear 8085-3 my prayer, 8605 O God; 430 give ear 238-54 to the words 561 of my mouth. 6310

54:3 For strangers 2114-5 are risen up 6965-1 against me, and oppressors 6184 seek 1245-14 after my soul: 5315 they have not set 7760-1 God 430 before them. Selah. 5542

54:4 Behold, God 430 [is] mine helper: 5826-6 the Lord 136 [is] with them that uphold 5564-6 my soul. 5315

54:5 He shall reward 7725-55|7725-4-k evil 7451 unto mine enemies: 8324-6 cut them off 6789-54 in thy truth. 571

54:6 I will freely 5071 sacrifice 2076-4 unto thee: I will praise 3034-55 thy name, 8034 O LORD; 3068 for [it is] good. 2896

54:7 For he hath delivered 5337-52 me out of all trouble: 6869 and mine eye 5869 hath seen 7200-1 [his desire] upon mine enemies. 341-6

55:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 on Neginoth, 5058 Maschil, 4905|7919-56 [A Psalm] of David.> 1732 Give ear 238-54 to my prayer, 8605 O God; 430 and hide 5956-101 not thyself from my supplication. 8467

55:2 Attend 7181-54 unto me, and hear 6030-3 me: I mourn 7300-55 in my complaint, 7879 and make a noise; 1949-55

55:3 Because of the voice 6963 of the enemy, 341-6 because 6440 of the oppression 6125 of the wicked: 7563 for they cast 4131-55 iniquity 205 upon me, and in wrath 639 they hate 7852-4 me.

55:4 My heart 3820 is sore pained 2342-4 within 7130 me: and the terrors 367 of death 4194 are fallen 5307-1 upon me.

55:5 Fearfulness 3374 and trembling 7461 are come 935-4 upon me, and horror 6427 hath overwhelmed 3680-17 me.

55:6 And I said, 559-4 Oh that 5414-4 I had wings 83 like a dove! 3123 [for then] would I fly away, 5774-4 and be at rest. 7931-4

55:7 Lo, [then] would I wander 5074-2 far off, 7368-55 [and] remain 3885-4 in the wilderness. 4057 Selah. 5542

55:8 I would hasten 2363-55 my escape 4655 from the windy 7307 storm 5584-5 [and] tempest. 5591

55:9 Destroy, 1104-16 O Lord, 136 [and] divide 6385-16 their tongues: 3956 for I have seen 7200-1 violence 2555 and strife 7379 in the city. 5892

55:10 Day 3119 and night 3915 they go about 5437-25 it upon the walls 2346 thereof: mischief 205 also and sorrow 5999 [are] in the midst 7130 of it.

55:11 Wickedness 1942 [is] in the midst 7130 thereof: deceit 8496 and guile 4820 depart 4185-55 not from her streets. 7339

55:12 For [it was] not an enemy 341-6 [that] reproached 2778-17 me; then I could have borne 5375-4 [it]: neither [was it] he that hated 8130-18 me [that] did magnify 1431-52 [himself] against me; then I would have hid 5641-11 myself from him:

55:13 But [it was] thou, a man 582 mine equal, 6187 my guide, 441 and mine acquaintance. 3045-30

55:14 We took sweet 4985-55 counsel 5475 together, 3162 [and] walked 1980-17 unto the house 1004 of God 430 in company. 7285

55:15 Let death 4194 seize 5377-55|3451-k upon them, [and] let them go down 3381-4 quick 2416 into hell: 7585 for wickedness 7451 [is] in their dwellings, 4033 [and] among 7130 them.

55:16 As for me, I will call 7121-4 upon God; 430 and the LORD 3068 shall save 3467-55 me.

55:17 Evening, 6153 and morning, 1242 and at noon, 6672 will I pray, 7878-4 and cry aloud: 1993-4 and he shall hear 8085-4 my voice. 6963

55:18 He hath delivered 6299-1 my soul 5315 in peace 7965 from the battle 7128 [that was] against me: for there were many 7227 with me.

55:19 God 410 shall hear, 8085-4 and afflict 6030-4 them, even he that abideth 3427-6 of old. 6924 Selah. 5542 Because they have no changes, 2487 therefore they fear 3372-1 not God. 430

55:20 He hath put forth 7971-1 his hands 3027 against such as be at peace 7965 with him: he hath broken 2490-14 his covenant. 1285

55:21 [The words] of his mouth 6310 were smoother 2505-1 than butter, 4260 but war 7128 [was] in his heart: 3820 his words 1697 were softer 7401-1 than oil, 8081 yet [were] they drawn swords. 6609

55:22 Cast 7993-54 thy burden 3053 upon the LORD, 3068 and he shall sustain 3557-46 thee: he shall never 3808 5769 suffer 5414-4 the righteous 6662 to be moved. 4131-2

55:23 But thou, O God, 430 shalt bring them down 3381-55 into the pit 875 of destruction: 7845 bloody 1818 and deceitful 4820 men 582 shall not live out half 2673-4 their days; 3117 but I will trust 982-4 in thee.

56:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 upon Jonathelemrechokim, 3128|3123|482|7350 Michtam 4387 of David, 1732 when the Philistines 6430 took 270-2 him in Gath.> 1661 Be merciful 2603-3 unto me, O God: 430 for man 582 would swallow me up; 7602-1 he fighting 3898-6 daily 3117 oppresseth 3905-4 me.

56:2 Mine enemies 8324-6 would daily 3117 swallow [me] up: 7602-1 for [they be] many 7227 that fight 3898-6 against me, O thou most High. 4791

56:3 What time 3117 I am afraid, 3372-4 I will trust 982-4 in thee.

56:4 In God 430 I will praise 1984-17 his word, 1697 in God 430 I have put my trust; 982-1 I will not fear 3372-4 what flesh 1320 can do 6213-4 unto me.

56:5 Every day 3117 they wrest 6087-17 my words: 1697 all their thoughts 4284 [are] against me for evil. 7451

56:6 They gather 1481-4 themselves together, they hide 6845-4|6845-55-k themselves, they mark 8104-4 my steps, 6119 when they wait 6960-14 for my soul. 5315

56:7 Shall they escape 6405 by iniquity? 205 in [thine] anger 639 cast down 3381-54 the people, 5971 O God. 430

56:8 Thou tellest 5608-1 my wanderings: 5112 put 7760-3 thou my tears 1832 into thy bottle: 4997 [are they] not in thy book? 5612

56:9 When 3117 I cry 7121-4 [unto thee], then shall mine enemies 341-6 turn 7725-4 back: 268 this I know; 3045-1 for God 430 [is] for me.

56:10 In God 430 will I praise 1984-17 [his] word: 1697 in the LORD 3068 will I praise 1984-17 [his] word. 1697

56:11 In God 430 have I put my trust: 982-1 I will not be afraid 3372-4 what man 120 can do 6213-4 unto me.

56:12 Thy vows 5088 [are] upon me, O God: 430 I will render 7999-17 praises 8426 unto thee.

56:13 For thou hast delivered 5337-52 my soul 5315 from death: 4194 [wilt] not [thou deliver] my feet 7272 from falling, 1762 that I may walk 1980-99 before 6440 God 430 in the light 216 of the living? 2416

57:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 Altaschith, 408|7843-55|516 Michtam 4387 of David, 1732 when he fled 1272-2 from 6440 Saul 7586 in the cave.> 4631 Be merciful 2603-3 unto me, O God, 430 be merciful 2603-3 unto me: for my soul 5315 trusteth 2620-1 in thee: yea, in the shadow 6738 of thy wings 3671 will I make my refuge, 2620-4 until [these] calamities 1942 be overpast. 5674-4

57:2 I will cry 7121-4 unto God 430 most high; 5945 unto God 410 that performeth 1584-6 [all things] for me.

57:3 He shall send 7971-4 from heaven, 8064 and save 3467-55 me [from] the reproach 2778-14 of him that would swallow me up. 7602-6 Selah. 5542 God 430 shall send 7971-4 forth his mercy 2617 and his truth. 571

57:4 My soul 5315 [is] among 8432 lions: 3833 [and] I lie 7901-4 [even among] them that are set on fire, 3857-6 [even] the sons 1121 of men, 120 whose teeth 8127 [are] spears 2595 and arrows, 2671 and their tongue 3956 a sharp 2299 sword. 2719

57:5 Be thou exalted, 7311-3 O God, 430 above the heavens; 8064 [let] thy glory 3519 [be] above all the earth. 776

57:6 They have prepared 3559-52 a net 7568 for my steps; 6471 my soul 5315 is bowed down: 3721-1 they have digged 3738-1 a pit 7882 before 6440 me, into the midst 8432 whereof they are fallen 5307-1 [themselves]. Selah. 5542

57:7 My heart 3820 is fixed, 3559-12 O God, 430 my heart 3820 is fixed: 3559-12 I will sing 7891-4 and give praise. 2167-17

57:8 Awake up, 5782-3 my glory; 3519 awake, 5782-3 psaltery 5035 and harp: 3658 I [myself] will awake 5782-55 early. 7837

57:9 I will praise 3034-55 thee, O Lord, 136 among the people: 5971 I will sing 2167-17 unto thee among the nations. 3816

57:10 For thy mercy 2617 [is] great 1419 unto the heavens, 8064 and thy truth 571 unto the clouds. 7834

57:11 Be thou exalted, 7311-3 O God, 430 above the heavens: 8064 [let] thy glory 3519 [be] above all the earth. 776

58:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 Altaschith, 408|7843-55|516 Michtam 4387 of David.> 1732 Do ye indeed 552 speak 1696-17 righteousness, 6664 O congregation? 482 do ye judge 8199-4 uprightly, 4339 O ye sons 1121 of men? 120

58:2 Yea, in heart 3820 ye work 6466-4 wickedness; 5766 ye weigh 6424-17 the violence 2555 of your hands 3027 in the earth. 776

58:3 The wicked 7563 are estranged 2114-1 from the womb: 7358 they go astray 8582-1 as soon as they be born, 990 speaking 1696-6 lies. 3577

58:4 Their poison 2534 [is] like 1823 the poison 2534 of a serpent: 5175 [they are] like the deaf 2795 adder 6620 [that] stoppeth 331-55 her ear; 241

58:5 Which will not hearken 8085-4 to the voice 6963 of charmers, 3907-18 charming 2266-6 2267 never so wisely. 2449-30

58:6 Break 2040-3 their teeth, 8127 O God, 430 in their mouth: 6310 break out 5422-2 the great teeth 4459 of the young lions, 3715 O LORD. 3068

58:7 Let them melt away 3988-11 as waters 4325 [which] run 1980-101 continually: [when] he bendeth 1869-4 [his bow to shoot] his arrows, 2671 let them be as cut in pieces. 4135-113

58:8 As a snail 7642 [which] melteth, 8557 let [every one of them] pass away: 1980-4 [like] the untimely birth 5309 of a woman, 802 [that] they may not see 2372-1 the sun. 8121

58:9 Before your pots 5518 can feel 995-4 the thorns, 329 he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, 8175-4 both living, 2416 and in [his] wrath. 2740

58:10 The righteous 6662 shall rejoice 8055-4 when he seeth 2372-1 the vengeance: 5359 he shall wash 7364-4 his feet 6471 in the blood 1818 of the wicked. 7563

58:11 So that a man 120 shall say, 559-4 Verily [there is] a reward 6529 for the righteous: 6662 verily he is 3426 a God 430 that judgeth 8199-6 in the earth. 776

59:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 Altaschith, 408|7843-55|516 Michtam 4387 of David; 1732 when Saul 7586 sent, 7971-2 and they watched 8104-4 the house 1004 to kill him.> 4191-53 Deliver 5337-54 me from mine enemies, 341-6 O my God: 430 defend 7682-17 me from them that rise up 6965-102 against me.

59:2 Deliver 5337-54 me from the workers 6466-6 of iniquity, 205 and save 3467-54 me from bloody 1818 men. 582

59:3 For, lo, they lie in wait 693-1 for my soul: 5315 the mighty 5794 are gathered 1481-4 against me; not [for] my transgression, 6588 nor [for] my sin, 2403 O LORD. 3068

59:4 They run 7323-4 and prepare 3559-113 themselves without [my] fault: 5771 awake 5782-3 to help 7125-2 me, and behold. 7200-3

59:5 Thou therefore, O LORD 3068 God 430 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel, 3478 awake 6974-54 to visit 6485-2 all the heathen: 1471 be not merciful 2603-4 to any wicked 205 transgressors. 898-6 Selah. 5542

59:6 They return 7725-4 at evening: 6153 they make a noise 1993-4 like a dog, 3611 and go round about 5437-25 the city. 5892

59:7 Behold, they belch out 5042-55 with their mouth: 6310 swords 2719 [are] in their lips: 8193 for who, [say they], doth hear? 8085-6

59:8 But thou, O LORD, 3068 shalt laugh 7832-4 at them; thou shalt have all the heathen 1471 in derision. 3932-4

59:9 [Because of] his strength 5797 will I wait 8104-4 upon thee: for God 430 [is] my defence. 4869

59:10 The God 430 of my mercy 2617 shall prevent 6923-17 me: God 430 shall let me see 7200-55 [my desire] upon mine enemies. 8324-6

59:11 Slay 2026-4 them not, lest my people 5971 forget: 7911-4 scatter 5128-54 them by thy power; 2428 and bring them down, 3381-54 O Lord 136 our shield. 4043

59:12 [For] the sin 2403 of their mouth 6310 [and] the words 1697 of their lips 8193 let them even be taken 3920-11 in their pride: 1347 and for cursing 423 and lying 3585 [which] they speak. 5608-17

59:13 Consume 3615-16 [them] in wrath, 2534 consume 3615-16 [them], that they [may] not [be]: and let them know 3045-4 that God 430 ruleth 4910-6 in Jacob 3290 unto the ends 657 of the earth. 776 Selah. 5542

59:14 And at evening 6153 let them return; 7725-4 [and] let them make a noise 1993-4 like a dog, 3611 and go round about 5437-25 the city. 5892

59:15 Let them wander up and down 5128-55|5128-4-k for meat, 398-2 and grudge 3885-4 if they be not satisfied. 7646-4

59:16 But I will sing 7891-4 of thy power; 5797 yea, I will sing aloud 7442-17 of thy mercy 2617 in the morning: 1242 for thou hast been my defence 4869 and refuge 4498 in the day 3117 of my trouble. 6862

59:17 Unto thee, O my strength, 5797 will I sing: 2167-17 for God 430 [is] my defence, 4869 [and] the God 430 of my mercy. 2617

60:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 upon Shushaneduth, 7799|5715|7802 Michtam 4387 of David, 1732 to teach; 3925-15 when he strove 5327-53 with Aramnaharaim 758|5104|763 and with Aramzobah, 758|6678|760 when Joab 3097 returned, 7725-4 and smote 5221-55 of Edom 123 in the valley 1516 of salt 4417 twelve 8147 6240 thousand.> 505 O God, 430 thou hast cast us off, 2186-1 thou hast scattered 6555-1 us, thou hast been displeased; 599-1 O turn thyself to us again. 7725-34

60:2 Thou hast made the earth 776 to tremble; 7493-52 thou hast broken 6480-1 it: heal 7495-3 the breaches 7667 thereof; for it shaketh. 4131-1

60:3 Thou hast shewed 7200-52 thy people 5971 hard things: 7186 thou hast made us to drink 8248-52 the wine 3196 of astonishment. 8653

60:4 Thou hast given 5414-1 a banner 5251 to them that fear 3373 thee, that it may be displayed 5127-111 because 6440 of the truth. 7189 Selah. 5542

60:5 That thy beloved 3039 may be delivered; 2502-11 save 3467-54 [with] thy right hand, 3225 and hear 6030-3 me.

60:6 God 430 hath spoken 1696-14 in his holiness; 6944 I will rejoice, 5937-4 I will divide 2505-17 Shechem, 7927 and mete out 4058-17 the valley 6010 of Succoth. 5523

60:7 Gilead 1568 [is] mine, and Manasseh 4519 [is] mine; Ephraim 669 also [is] the strength 4581 of mine head; 7218 Judah 3063 [is] my lawgiver; 2710-26

60:8 Moab 4124 [is] my washpot; 5518 7366 over Edom 123 will I cast 7993-55 out my shoe: 5275 Philistia, 6429 triumph 7321-112 thou because of me.

60:9 Who will bring 2986-55 me [into] the strong 4692 city? 5892 who will lead 5148-1 me into Edom? 123

60:10 [Wilt] not thou, O God, 430 [which] hadst cast us off? 2186-1 and [thou], O God, 430 [which] didst not go out 3318-4 with our armies? 6635

60:11 Give 3051-3 us help 5833 from trouble: 6862 for vain 7723 [is] the help 8668 of man. 120

60:12 Through God 430 we shall do 6213-4 valiantly: 2428 for he [it is that] shall tread down 947-4 our enemies. 6862

61:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 upon Neginah, 5058 [A Psalm] of David.> 1732 Hear 8085-3 my cry, 7440 O God; 430 attend 7181-54 unto my prayer. 8605

61:2 From the end 7097 of the earth 776 will I cry 7121-4 unto thee, when my heart 3820 is overwhelmed: 5848-2 lead 5148-55 me to the rock 6697 [that] is higher 7311-4 than I.

61:3 For thou hast been a shelter 4268 for me, [and] a strong 5797 tower 4026 from 6440 the enemy. 341-6

61:4 I will abide 1481-4 in thy tabernacle 168 for ever: 5769 I will trust 2620-4 in the covert 5643 of thy wings. 3671 Selah. 5542

61:5 For thou, O God, 430 hast heard 8085-1 my vows: 5088 thou hast given 5414-1 [me] the heritage 3425 of those that fear 3373 thy name. 8034

61:6 Thou wilt prolong 3254-55 3117 the king's 4428 life: 3117 [and] his years 8141 as many 1755 generations. 1755

61:7 He shall abide 3427-4 before 6440 God 430 for ever: 5769 O prepare 4487-16 mercy 2617 and truth, 571 [which] may preserve 5341-4 him.

61:8 So will I sing praise 2167-17 unto thy name 8034 for ever, 5703 that I may daily 3117 3117 perform 7999-15 my vows. 5088

62:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 to Jeduthun, 3038 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 Truly my soul 5315 waiteth 1747 upon God: 430 from him [cometh] my salvation. 3444

62:2 He only [is] my rock 6697 and my salvation; 3444 [he is] my defence; 4869 I shall not be greatly 7227 moved. 4131-11

62:3 How long will ye imagine mischief 2050-25 against a man? 376 ye shall be slain 7523-29 all of you: as a bowing 5186-7 wall 7023 [shall ye be, and as] a tottering 1760-7 fence. 1447

62:4 They only consult 3289-1 to cast [him] down 5080-53 from his excellency: 7613 they delight 7521-4 in lies: 3577 they bless 1288-17 with their mouth, 6310 but they curse 7043-17 inwardly. 7130 Selah. 5542

62:5 My soul, 5315 wait 1826-3 thou only upon God; 430 for my expectation 8615 [is] from him.

62:6 He only [is] my rock 6697 and my salvation: 3444 [he is] my defence; 4869 I shall not be moved. 4131-11

62:7 In God 430 [is] my salvation 3468 and my glory: 3519 the rock 6697 of my strength, 5797 [and] my refuge, 4268 [is] in God. 430

62:8 Trust 982-3 in him at all times; 6256 [ye] people, 5971 pour out 8210-3 your heart 3824 before 6440 him: God 430 [is] a refuge 4268 for us. Selah. 5542

62:9 Surely men 1121 of low degree 120 [are] vanity, 1892 [and] men 1121 of high degree 376 [are] a lie: 3577 to be laid 5927-2 in the balance, 3976 they [are] altogether 3162 [lighter] than vanity. 1892

62:10 Trust 982-4 not in oppression, 6233 and become not vain 1891-4 in robbery: 1498 if riches 2428 increase, 5107-4 set 7896-4 not your heart 3820 [upon them].

62:11 God 430 hath spoken 1696-14 once; 259 twice 8147 have I heard 8085-1 this; 2098 that power 5797 [belongeth] unto God. 430

62:12 Also unto thee, O Lord, 136 [belongeth] mercy: 2617 for thou renderest 7999-17 to every man 376 according to his work. 4639

63:1 <A Psalm 4210 of David, 1732 when he was in the wilderness 4057 of Judah.> 3063 O God, 430 thou [art] my God; 410 early will I seek 7836-17 thee: my soul 5315 thirsteth 6770-1 for thee, my flesh 1320 longeth 3642-1 for thee in a dry 6723 and thirsty 5889 land, 776 where no 1097 water 4325 is;

63:2 To see 7200-2 thy power 5797 and thy glory, 3519 so [as] I have seen 2372-1 thee in the sanctuary. 6944

63:3 Because thy lovingkindness 2617 [is] better 2896 than life, 2416 my lips 8193 shall praise 7623-17 thee.

63:4 Thus will I bless 1288-17 thee while I live: 2416 I will lift up 5375-4 my hands 3709 in thy name. 8034

63:5 My soul 5315 shall be satisfied 7646-4 as [with] marrow 2459 and fatness; 1880 and my mouth 6310 shall praise 1984-17 [thee] with joyful 7445 lips: 8193

63:6 When I remember 2142-1 thee upon my bed, 3326 [and] meditate 1897-4 on thee in the [night] watches. 821

63:7 Because thou hast been my help, 5833 therefore in the shadow 6738 of thy wings 3671 will I rejoice. 7442-17

63:8 My soul 5315 followeth hard 1692-1 after 310 thee: thy right hand 3225 upholdeth 8551-1 me.

63:9 But those [that] seek 1245-17 my soul, 5315 to destroy 7722 [it], shall go 935-4 into the lower parts 8482 of the earth. 776

63:10 They shall fall 5064-55 by 3027 the sword: 2719 they shall be a portion 4521 for foxes. 7776

63:11 But the king 4428 shall rejoice 8055-4 in God; 430 every one that sweareth 7650-12 by him shall glory: 1984-101 but the mouth 6310 of them that speak 1696-6 lies 8267 shall be stopped. 5534-11

64:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 Hear 8085-3 my voice, 6963 O God, 430 in my prayer: 7879 preserve 5341-4 my life 2416 from fear 6343 of the enemy. 341-6

64:2 Hide 5641-55 me from the secret counsel 5475 of the wicked; 7489-56 from the insurrection 7285 of the workers 6466-6 of iniquity: 205

64:3 Who whet 8150-1 their tongue 3956 like a sword, 2719 [and] bend 1869-1 [their bows to shoot] their arrows, 2671 [even] bitter 4751 words: 1697

64:4 That they may shoot 3384-2 in secret 4565 at the perfect: 8535 suddenly 6597 do they shoot 3384-55 at him, and fear 3372-4 not.

64:5 They encourage 2388-17 themselves [in] an evil 7451 matter: 1697 they commune 5608-17 of laying snares 4170 privily; 2934-2 they say, 559-1 Who shall see 7200-4 them?

64:6 They search out 2664-4 iniquities; 5766 they accomplish 8552-1 a diligent 2664-30 search: 2665 both the inward 7130 [thought] of every one 376 [of them], and the heart, 3820 [is] deep. 6013

64:7 But God 430 shall shoot 3384-55 at them [with] an arrow; 2671 suddenly 6597 shall they be wounded. 4347

64:8 So they shall make their own tongue 3956 to fall 3782-55 upon themselves: all that see 7200-6 them shall flee away. 5074-113

64:9 And all men 120 shall fear, 3372-4 and shall declare 5046-55 the work 6467 of God; 430 for they shall wisely consider 7919-52 of his doing. 4639

64:10 The righteous 6662 shall be glad 8055-4 in the LORD, 3068 and shall trust 2620-1 in him; and all the upright 3477 in heart 3820 shall glory. 1984-101

65:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 A Psalm 4210 [and] Song 7892 of David.> 1732 Praise 8416 waiteth 1747 for thee, O God, 430 in Sion: 6726 and unto thee shall the vow 5088 be performed. 7999-29

65:2 O thou that hearest 8085-6 prayer, 8605 unto thee shall all flesh 1320 come. 935-4

65:3 Iniquities 1697 5771 prevail 1396-1 against me: [as for] our transgressions, 6588 thou shalt purge them away. 3722-17

65:4 Blessed 835 [is the man whom] thou choosest, 977-4 and causest to approach 7126-17 [unto thee, that] he may dwell 7931-4 in thy courts: 2691 we shall be satisfied 7646-4 with the goodness 2898 of thy house, 1004 [even] of thy holy 6918 temple. 1964

65:5 [By] terrible things 3372-12 in righteousness 6664 wilt thou answer 6030-4 us, O God 430 of our salvation; 3468 [who art] the confidence 4009 of all the ends 7099 of the earth, 776 and of them that are afar off 7350 [upon] the sea: 3220

65:6 Which by his strength 3581 setteth fast 3559-56 the mountains; 2022 [being] girded 247-12 with power: 1369

65:7 Which stilleth 7623-56 the noise 7588 of the seas, 3220 the noise 7588 of their waves, 1530 and the tumult 1995 of the people. 3816

65:8 They also that dwell 3427-6 in the uttermost parts 7099 are afraid 3372-4 at thy tokens: 226 thou makest the outgoings 4161 of the morning 1242 and evening 6153 to rejoice. 7442-55

65:9 Thou visitest 6485-1 the earth, 776 and waterest 7783-34 it: thou greatly 7227 enrichest 6238-55 it with the river 6388 of God, 430 [which] is full 4390-1 of water: 4325 thou preparest 3559-55 them corn, 1715 when thou hast so provided 3559-55 for it.

65:10 Thou waterest the ridges 8525 thereof abundantly: 7301-16 thou settlest 5181-15 the furrows 1418 thereof: thou makest it soft 4127-34 with showers: 7241 thou blessest 1288-17 the springing 6780 thereof.

65:11 Thou crownest 5849-14 the year 8141 with thy goodness; 2896 and thy paths 4570 drop 7491-4 fatness. 1880

65:12 They drop 7491-4 [upon] the pastures 4999 of the wilderness: 4057 and the little hills 1389 rejoice 1524 on every side. 2296-4

65:13 The pastures 3733 are clothed 3847-1 with flocks; 6629 the valleys 6010 also are covered over 5848-4 with corn; 1250 they shout for joy, 7321-113 they also sing. 7891-4

66:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 A Song 7892 [or] Psalm.> 4210 Make a joyful noise 7321-54 unto God, 430 all ye lands: 776

66:2 Sing forth 2167-16 the honour 3519 of his name: 8034 make 7760-3 his praise 8416 glorious. 3519

66:3 Say 559-3 unto God, 430 How terrible 3372-12 [art thou in] thy works! 4639 through the greatness 7230 of thy power 5797 shall thine enemies 341-6 submit 3584-17 themselves unto thee.

66:4 All the earth 776 shall worship 7812-101 thee, and shall sing 2167-17 unto thee; they shall sing 2167-17 [to] thy name. 8034 Selah. 5542

66:5 Come 3212-3 and see 7200-3 the works 4659 of God: 430 [he is] terrible 3372-12 [in his] doing 5949 toward the children 1121 of men. 120

66:6 He turned 2015-1 the sea 3220 into dry 3004 [land]: they went 5674-4 through the flood 5104 on foot: 7272 there did we rejoice 8055-4 in him.

66:7 He ruleth 4910-6 by his power 1369 for ever; 5769 his eyes 5869 behold 6822-4 the nations: 1471 let not the rebellious 5637-6 exalt 7311-4|7311-55-k themselves. Selah. 5542

66:8 O bless 1288-16 our God, 430 ye people, 5971 and make the voice 6963 of his praise 8416 to be heard: 8085-54

66:9 Which holdeth 7760-6 our soul 5315 in life, 2416 and suffereth 5414-1 not our feet 7272 to be moved. 4132

66:10 For thou, O God, 430 hast proved 974-1 us: thou hast tried 6884-1 us, as silver 3701 is tried. 6884-2

66:11 Thou broughtest 935-52 us into the net; 4686 thou laidst 7760-1 affliction 4157 upon our loins. 4975

66:12 Thou hast caused men 582 to ride 7392-52 over our heads; 7218 we went 935-1 through fire 784 and through water: 4325 but thou broughtest us out 3318-55 into a wealthy 7310 [place].

66:13 I will go 935-4 into thy house 1004 with burnt offerings: 5930 I will pay 7999-17 thee my vows, 5088

66:14 Which my lips 8193 have uttered, 6475-1 and my mouth 6310 hath spoken, 1696-14 when I was in trouble. 6862

66:15 I will offer 5927-55 unto thee burnt sacrifices 5930 of fatlings, 4220 with the incense 7004 of rams; 352 I will offer 6213-4 bullocks 1241 with goats. 6260 Selah. 5542

66:16 Come 3212-3 [and] hear, 8085-3 all ye that fear 3373 God, 430 and I will declare 5608-17 what he hath done 6213-1 for my soul. 5315

66:17 I cried 7121-1 unto him with my mouth, 6310 and he was extolled 7311-36|7318-36 with 8478 my tongue. 3956

66:18 If I regard 7200-1 iniquity 205 in my heart, 3820 the Lord 136 will not hear 8085-4 [me]:

66:19 [But] verily 403 God 430 hath heard 8085-1 [me]; he hath attended 7181-52 to the voice 6963 of my prayer. 8605

66:20 Blessed 1288-7 [be] God, 430 which hath not turned away 5493-52 my prayer, 8605 nor his mercy 2617 from me.

67:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 on Neginoth, 5058 A Psalm 4210 [or] Song.> 7892 God 430 be merciful 2603-4 unto us, and bless 1288-17 us; [and] cause his face 6440 to shine 215-55 upon us; Selah. 5542

67:2 That thy way 1870 may be known 3045-2 upon earth, 776 thy saving health 3444 among all nations. 1471

67:3 Let the people 5971 praise 3034-55 thee, O God; 430 let all the people 5971 praise 3034-55 thee.

67:4 O let the nations 3816 be glad 8055-4 and sing for joy: 7442-17 for thou shalt judge 8199-4 the people 5971 righteously, 4334 and govern 5148-55 the nations 3816 upon earth. 776 Selah. 5542

67:5 Let the people 5971 praise 3034-55 thee, O God; 430 let all the people 5971 praise 3034-55 thee.

67:6 [Then] shall the earth 776 yield 5414-1 her increase; 2981 [and] God, 430 [even] our own God, 430 shall bless 1288-17 us.

67:7 God 430 shall bless 1288-17 us; and all the ends 657 of the earth 776 shall fear 3372-4 him.

68:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 A Psalm 4210 [or] Song 7892 of David.> 1732 Let God 430 arise, 6965-4 let his enemies 341-6 be scattered: 6327-4 let them also that hate 8130-18 him flee 5127-4 before 6440 him.

68:2 As smoke 6227 is driven away, 5086-9 [so] drive [them] away: 5086-4 as wax 1749 melteth 4549-9 before 6440 the fire, 784 [so] let the wicked 7563 perish 6-4 at the presence 6440 of God. 430

68:3 But let the righteous 6662 be glad; 8055-4 let them rejoice 5970-4 before 6440 God: 430 yea, let them exceedingly 8057 rejoice. 7797-4

68:4 Sing 7891-3 unto God, 430 sing praises 2167-16 to his name: 8034 extol 5549-3 him that rideth 7392-6 upon the heavens 6160 by his name 8034 JAH, 3050 and rejoice 5937-3 before 6440 him.

68:5 A father 1 of the fatherless, 3490 and a judge 1781 of the widows, 490 [is] God 430 in his holy 6944 habitation. 4583

68:6 God 430 setteth 3427-56 the solitary 3173 in families: 1004 he bringeth out 3318-56 those which are bound 615 with chains: 3574 but the rebellious 5637-6 dwell 7931-1 in a dry 6707 [land].

68:7 O God, 430 when thou wentest forth 3318-2 before 6440 thy people, 5971 when thou didst march 6805-2 through the wilderness; 3452 Selah: 5542

68:8 The earth 776 shook, 7493-1 the heavens 8064 also dropped 5197-1 at the presence 6440 of God: 430 [even] Sinai 5514 itself 2088 [was moved] at the presence 6440 of God, 430 the God 430 of Israel. 3478

68:9 Thou, O God, 430 didst send 5130-55 a plentiful 5071 rain, 1653 whereby thou didst confirm 3559-31 thine inheritance, 5159 when it was weary. 3811-8

68:10 Thy congregation 2416 hath dwelt 3427-1 therein: thou, O God, 430 hast prepared 3559-55 of thy goodness 2896 for the poor. 6041

68:11 The Lord 136 gave 5414-4 the word: 562 great 7227 [was] the company 6635 of those that published 1319-18 [it].

68:12 Kings 4428 of armies 6635 did flee 5074-4 apace: 5074-4 and she that tarried 5116 at home 1004 divided 2505-17 the spoil. 7998

68:13 Though ye have lien 7901-4 among the pots, 8240 [yet shall ye be as] the wings 3671 of a dove 3123 covered 2645-12 with silver, 3701 and her feathers 84 with yellow 3422 gold. 2742

68:14 When the Almighty 7706 scattered 6566-15 kings 4428 in it, it was [white] as snow 7949-55 in Salmon. 6756

68:15 The hill 2022 of God 430 [is as] the hill 2022 of Bashan; 1316 an high 1386 hill 2022 [as] the hill 2022 of Bashan. 1316

68:16 Why leap 7520-17 ye, ye high 1386 hills? 2022 [this is] the hill 2022 [which] God 430 desireth 2530-1 to dwell in; 3427-2 yea, the LORD 3068 will dwell 7931-4 [in it] for ever. 5331

68:17 The chariots 7393 of God 430 [are] twenty thousand, 7239 [even] thousands 505 of angels: 8136 the Lord 136 [is] among them, [as in] Sinai, 5514 in the holy 6944 [place].

68:18 Thou hast ascended 5927-1 on high, 4791 thou hast led captivity 7628 captive: 7617-1 thou hast received 3947-1 gifts 4979 for men; 120 yea, [for] the rebellious 5637-6 also, that the LORD 3050 God 430 might dwell 7931-2 [among them].

68:19 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the Lord, 136 [who] daily 3117 3117 loadeth 6006-4 us [with benefits, even] the God 410 of our salvation. 3444 Selah. 5542

68:20 [He that is] our God 410 [is] the God 410 of salvation; 4190 and unto GOD 3069 the Lord 136 [belong] the issues 8444 from death. 4194

68:21 But God 430 shall wound 4272-4 the head 7218 of his enemies, 341-6 [and] the hairy 8181 scalp 6936 of such an one as goeth on still 1980-102 in his trespasses. 817

68:22 The Lord 136 said, 559-1 I will bring again 7725-55 from Bashan, 1316 I will bring [my people] again 7725-55 from the depths 4688 of the sea: 3220

68:23 That thy foot 7272 may be dipped 4272-4 in the blood 1818 of [thine] enemies, 341-6 [and] the tongue 3956 of thy dogs 3611 in the same.

68:24 They have seen 7200-1 thy goings, 1979 O God; 430 [even] the goings 1979 of my God, 410 my King, 4428 in the sanctuary. 6944

68:25 The singers 7891-6 went before, 6923-14 the players on instruments 5059-6 [followed] after; 310 among 8432 [them were] the damsels 5959 playing with timbrels. 8608-6

68:26 Bless 1288-16 ye God 430 in the congregations, 4721 [even] the Lord, 136 from the fountain 4726 of Israel. 3478

68:27 There [is] little 6810 Benjamin 1144 [with] their ruler, 7287-6 the princes 8269 of Judah 3063 [and] their council, 7277 the princes 8269 of Zebulun, 2074 [and] the princes 8269 of Naphtali. 5321

68:28 Thy God 430 hath commanded 6680-14 thy strength: 5797 strengthen, 5810-3 O God, 430 that which 2098 thou hast wrought 6466-1 for us.

68:29 Because of thy temple 1964 at Jerusalem 3389 shall kings 4428 bring 2986-55 presents 7862 unto thee.

68:30 Rebuke 1605-3 the company 2416 of spearmen, 7070 the multitude 5712 of the bulls, 47 with the calves 5695 of the people, 5971 [till every one] submit 7511-102 himself with pieces 7518 of silver: 3701 scatter 967-14 thou the people 5971 [that] delight 2654-4 in war. 7128

68:31 Princes 2831 shall come 857-4 out of Egypt; 4714 Ethiopia 3568 shall soon stretch out 7323-55 her hands 3027 unto God. 430

68:32 Sing 7891-3 unto God, 430 ye kingdoms 4467 of the earth; 776 O sing praises 2167-16 unto the Lord; 136 Selah: 5542

68:33 To him that rideth 7392-6 upon the heavens 8064 of heavens, 8064 [which were] of old; 6924 lo, he doth send out 5414-4 his voice, 6963 [and that] a mighty 5797 voice. 6963

68:34 Ascribe 5414-3 ye strength 5797 unto God: 430 his excellency 1346 [is] over Israel, 3478 and his strength 5797 [is] in the clouds. 7834

68:35 O God, 430 [thou art] terrible 3372-12 out of thy holy places: 4720 the God 410 of Israel 3478 [is] he that giveth 5414-6 strength 5797 and power 8592 unto [his] people. 5971 Blessed 1288-7 [be] God. 430

69:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 upon Shoshannim, 7799 [A Psalm] of David.> 1732 Save 3467-54 me, O God; 430 for the waters 4325 are come in 935-1 unto [my] soul. 5315

69:2 I sink 2883-1 in deep 4688 mire, 3121 where [there is] no standing: 4613 I am come 935-1 into deep 4615 waters, 4325 where the floods 7641 overflow 7857-1 me.

69:3 I am weary 3021-1 of my crying: 7121-2 my throat 1627 is dried: 2787-8 mine eyes 5869 fail 3615-1 while I wait 3176-18 for my God. 430

69:4 They that hate 8130-6 me without a cause 2600 are more 7231-1 than the hairs 8185 of mine head: 7218 they that would destroy 6789-56 me, [being] mine enemies 341-6 wrongfully, 8267 are mighty: 6105-1 then I restored 7725-55 [that] which I took not away. 1497-1

69:5 O God, 430 thou knowest 3045-1 my foolishness; 200 and my sins 819 are not hid 3582-8 from thee.

69:6 Let not them that wait 6960-6 on thee, O Lord 136 GOD 3069 of hosts, 6635 be ashamed 954-4 for my sake: let not those that seek 1245-18 thee be confounded 3637-11 for my sake, O God 430 of Israel. 3478

69:7 Because for thy sake I have borne 5375-1 reproach; 2781 shame 3639 hath covered 3680-14 my face. 6440

69:8 I am become a stranger 2114-94 unto my brethren, 251 and an alien 5237 unto my mother's 517 children. 1121

69:9 For the zeal 7068 of thine house 1004 hath eaten me 398-1 up; and the reproaches 2781 of them that reproached 2778-6 thee are fallen 5307-1 upon me.

69:10 When I wept, 1058-4 [and chastened] my soul 5315 with fasting, 6685 that was to my reproach. 2781

69:11 I made 5414-4 sackcloth 8242 also my garment; 3830 and I became a proverb 4912 to them.

69:12 They that sit in 3427-6 the gate 8179 speak 7878-4 against me; and I [was] the song 5058 of the drunkards. 8354-6 7941

69:13 But as for me, my prayer 8605 [is] unto thee, O LORD, 3068 [in] an acceptable 7522 time: 6256 O God, 430 in the multitude 7230 of thy mercy 2617 hear 6030-3 me, in the truth 571 of thy salvation. 3468

69:14 Deliver 5337-54 me out of the mire, 2916 and let me not sink: 2883-4 let me be delivered 5337-11 from them that hate 8130-6 me, and out of the deep 4615 waters. 4325

69:15 Let not the waterflood 4325 7641 overflow 7857-4 me, neither let the deep 4688 swallow me up, 1104-4 and let not the pit 875 shut 332-4 her mouth 6310 upon me.

69:16 Hear 6030-3 me, O LORD; 3068 for thy lovingkindness 2617 [is] good: 2896 turn 6437-3 unto me according to the multitude 7230 of thy tender mercies. 7356

69:17 And hide 5641-55 not thy face 6440 from thy servant; 5650 for I am in trouble: 6887-1 hear 6030-3 me speedily. 4118

69:18 Draw nigh 7126-3 unto my soul, 5315 [and] redeem 1350-3 it: deliver 6299-3 me because of mine enemies. 341-6

69:19 Thou hast known 3045-1 my reproach, 2781 and my shame, 1322 and my dishonour: 3639 mine adversaries 6887-6 [are] all before thee.

69:20 Reproach 2781 hath broken 7665-1 my heart; 3820 and I am full of heaviness: 5136-4 and I looked 6960-17 [for some] to take pity, 5110-2 but [there was] none; and for comforters, 5162-18 but I found 4672-1 none.

69:21 They gave 5414-4 me also gall 7219 for my meat; 1267 and in my thirst 6772 they gave me vinegar 2558 to drink. 8248-55

69:22 Let their table 7979 become a snare 6341 before 6440 them: and [that which should have been] for [their] welfare, 7965 [let it become] a trap. 4170

69:23 Let their eyes 5869 be darkened, 2821-4 that they see 7200-2 not; and make their loins 4975 continually 8548 to shake. 4571-54

69:24 Pour out 8210-3 thine indignation 2195 upon them, and let thy wrathful 2740 anger 639 take hold 5381-55 of them.

69:25 Let their habitation 2918 be desolate; 8074-12 [and] let none dwell 3427-6 in their tents. 168

69:26 For they persecute 7291-1 [him] whom thou hast smitten; 5221-52 and they talk 5608-17 to the grief 4341 of those whom thou hast wounded. 2491

69:27 Add 5414-3 iniquity 5771 unto their iniquity: 5771 and let them not come 935-4 into thy righteousness. 6666

69:28 Let them be blotted out 4229-11 of the book 5612 of the living, 2416 and not be written 3789-11 with the righteous. 6662

69:29 But I [am] poor 6041 and sorrowful: 3510-6 let thy salvation, 3444 O God, 430 set me up on high. 7682-17

69:30 I will praise 1984-17 the name 8034 of God 430 with a song, 7892 and will magnify 1431-17 him with thanksgiving. 8426

69:31 [This] also shall please 3190-4 the LORD 3068 better than an ox 7794 [or] bullock 6499 that hath horns 7160-56 and hoofs. 6536-56

69:32 The humble 6035 shall see 7200-1 [this, and] be glad: 8055-4 and your heart 3824 shall live 2421-4 that seek 1875-6 God. 430

69:33 For the LORD 3068 heareth 8085-6 the poor, 34 and despiseth 959-1 not his prisoners. 615

69:34 Let the heaven 8064 and earth 776 praise 1984-17 him, the seas, 3220 and every thing that moveth 7430-6 therein.

69:35 For God 430 will save 3467-55 Zion, 6726 and will build 1129-4 the cities 5892 of Judah: 3063 that they may dwell 3427-1 there, and have it in possession. 3423-1

69:36 The seed 2233 also of his servants 5650 shall inherit 5157-4 it: and they that love 157-6 his name 8034 shall dwell 7931-4 therein.

70:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 [A Psalm] of David, 1732 to bring to remembrance.> 2142-53 [Make haste], O God, 430 to deliver 5337-53 me; make haste 2363-3 to help 5833 me, O LORD. 3068

70:2 Let them be ashamed 954-4 and confounded 2659-4 that seek 1245-18 after my soul: 5315 let them be turned 5472-11 backward, 268 and put to confusion, 3637-11 that desire 2655 my hurt. 7451

70:3 Let them be turned back 7725-4 for a reward 6118 of their shame 1322 that say, 559-6 Aha, 1889 aha. 1889

70:4 Let all those that seek 1245-18 thee rejoice 7797-4 and be glad 8055-4 in thee: and let such as love 157-6 thy salvation 3444 say 559-4 continually, 8548 Let God 430 be magnified. 1431-4

70:5 But I [am] poor 6041 and needy: 34 make haste 2363-3 unto me, O God: 430 thou [art] my help 5828 and my deliverer; 6403-18 O LORD, 3068 make no tarrying. 309-17

71:1 In thee, O LORD, 3068 do I put my trust: 2620-1 let me never 408 5769 be put to confusion. 954-4

71:2 Deliver 5337-55 me in thy righteousness, 6666 and cause me to escape: 6403-17 incline 5186-54 thine ear 241 unto me, and save 3467-54 me.

71:3 Be thou my strong 6697 habitation, 4583 whereunto I may continually 8548 resort: 935-2 thou hast given commandment 6680-14 to save 3467-53 me; for thou [art] my rock 5553 and my fortress. 4686

71:4 Deliver 6403-16 me, O my God, 430 out of the hand 3027 of the wicked, 7563 out of the hand 3709 of the unrighteous 5765-18 and cruel man. 2556-6

71:5 For thou [art] my hope, 8615 O Lord 136 GOD: 3069 [thou art] my trust 4009 from my youth. 5271

71:6 By thee have I been holden up 5564-8 from the womb: 990 thou art he that took 1491-6 me out of my mother's 517 bowels: 4578 my praise 8416 [shall be] continually 8548 of thee.

71:7 I am as a wonder 4159 unto many; 7227 but thou [art] my strong 5797 refuge. 4268

71:8 Let my mouth 6310 be filled 4390-11 [with] thy praise 8416 [and with] thy honour 8597 all the day. 3117

71:9 Cast me not off 7993-55 in the time 6256 of old age; 2209 forsake 5800-4 me not when my strength 3581 faileth. 3615-2

71:10 For mine enemies 341-6 speak 559-1 against me; and they that lay wait 8104-6 for my soul 5315 take counsel 3289-8 together, 3162

71:11 Saying, 559-2 God 430 hath forsaken 5800-1 him: persecute 7291-3 and take 8610-3 him; for [there is] none to deliver 5337-56 [him].

71:12 O God, 430 be not far 7368-4 from me: O my God, 430 make haste 2363-3|2439-k for my help. 5833

71:13 Let them be confounded 954-4 [and] consumed 3615-4 that are adversaries 7853-6 to my soul; 5315 let them be covered 5844-4 [with] reproach 2781 and dishonour 3639 that seek 1245-18 my hurt. 7451

71:14 But I will hope 3176-17 continually, 8548 and will yet praise 8416 thee more and more. 3254-52

71:15 My mouth 6310 shall shew forth 5608-17 thy righteousness 6666 [and] thy salvation 8668 all the day; 3117 for I know 3045-1 not the numbers 5615 [thereof].

71:16 I will go in 935-4 the strength 1369 of the Lord 136 GOD: 3069 I will make mention 2142-55 of thy righteousness, 6666 [even] of thine only.

71:17 O God, 430 thou hast taught 3925-14 me from my youth: 5271 and hitherto have I declared 5046-55 thy wondrous works. 6381-12

71:18 Now also when 5704 I am old 2209 and grayheaded, 7872 O God, 430 forsake 5800-4 me not; until I have shewed 5046-55 thy strength 2220 unto [this] generation, 1755 [and] thy power 1369 to every one [that] is to come. 935-4

71:19 Thy righteousness 6666 also, O God, 430 [is] very high, 4791 who hast done 6213-1 great things: 1419 O God, 430 who [is] like unto thee!

71:20 [Thou], which hast shewed 7200-52 me great 7227 and sore 7451 troubles, 6869 shalt quicken 2421-17 me again, 7725-4 and shalt bring me up 5927-55 again 7725-4 from the depths 8415 of the earth. 776

71:21 Thou shalt increase 7235-55 my greatness, 1420 and comfort 5162-17 me on every side. 5437-11

71:22 I will also praise 3034-55 thee with the 3627 psaltery, 5035 [even] thy truth, 571 O my God: 430 unto thee will I sing 2167-17 with the harp, 3658 O thou Holy One 6918 of Israel. 3478

71:23 My lips 8193 shall greatly rejoice 7442-17 when I sing 2167-17 unto thee; and my soul, 5315 which thou hast redeemed. 6299-1

71:24 My tongue 3956 also shall talk 1897-4 of thy righteousness 6666 all the day 3117 long: for they are confounded, 954-1 for they are brought unto shame, 2659-1 that seek 1245-18 my hurt. 7451

72:1 <[A Psalm] for Solomon.> 8010 Give 5414-3 the king 4428 thy judgments, 4941 O God, 430 and thy righteousness 6666 unto the king's 4428 son. 1121

72:2 He shall judge 1777-4 thy people 5971 with righteousness, 6664 and thy poor 6041 with judgment. 4941

72:3 The mountains 2022 shall bring 5375-4 peace 7965 to the people, 5971 and the little hills, 1389 by righteousness. 6666

72:4 He shall judge 8199-4 the poor 6041 of the people, 5971 he shall save 3467-55 the children 1121 of the needy, 34 and shall break in pieces 1792-17 the oppressor. 6231-6

72:5 They shall fear 3372-4 thee as long as 5973 the sun 8121 and moon 3394 endure, 6440 throughout all 1755 generations. 1755

72:6 He shall come down 3381-4 like rain 4306 upon the mown 1488 grass: as showers 7241 [that] water 2222 the earth. 776

72:7 In his days 3117 shall the righteous 6662 flourish; 6524-4 and abundance 7230 of peace 7965 so long as the moon 3394 endureth.

72:8 He shall have dominion 7287-4 also from sea 3220 to sea, 3220 and from the river 5104 unto the ends 657 of the earth. 776

72:9 They that dwell in the wilderness 6728 shall bow 3766-4 before 6440 him; and his enemies 341-6 shall lick 3897-17 the dust. 6083

72:10 The kings 4428 of Tarshish 8659 and of the isles 339 shall bring 7725-55 presents: 4503 the kings 4428 of Sheba 7614 and Seba 5434 shall offer 7126-55 gifts. 814

72:11 Yea, all kings 4428 shall fall down 7812-101 before him: all nations 1471 shall serve 5647-4 him.

72:12 For he shall deliver 5337-55 the needy 34 when he crieth; 7768-18 the poor 6041 also, and [him] that hath no helper. 5826-6

72:13 He shall spare 2347-4 the poor 1800 and needy, 34 and shall save 3467-55 the souls 5315 of the needy. 34

72:14 He shall redeem 1350-4 their soul 5315 from deceit 8496 and violence: 2555 and precious 3365-4 shall their blood 1818 be in his sight. 5869

72:15 And he shall live, 2421-4 and to him shall be given 5414-4 of the gold 2091 of Sheba: 7614 prayer also shall be made 6419-101 for him continually; 8548 [and] daily 3117 shall he be praised. 1288-17

72:16 There shall be an handful 6451 of corn 1250 in the earth 776 upon the top 7218 of the mountains; 2022 the fruit 6529 thereof shall shake 7493-4 like Lebanon: 3844 and [they] of the city 5892 shall flourish 6692-55 like grass 6212 of the earth. 776

72:17 His name 8034 shall endure for ever: 5769 his name 8034 shall be continued 5125-11|5125-55-k as long as 6440 the sun: 8121 and [men] shall be blessed 1288-101 in him: all nations 1471 shall call him blessed. 833-17

72:18 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD 3068 God, 430 the God 430 of Israel, 3478 who only doeth 6213-6 wondrous things. 6381-12

72:19 And blessed 1288-7 [be] his glorious 3519 name 8034 for ever: 5769 and let the whole earth 776 be filled 4390-11 [with] his glory; 3519 Amen, 543 and Amen. 543

72:20 The prayers 8605 of David 1732 the son 1121 of Jesse 3448 are ended. 3615-27

73:1 <A Psalm 4210 of Asaph.> 623 Truly God 430 [is] good 2896 to Israel, 3478 [even] to such as are of a clean 1249 heart. 3824

73:2 But as for me, my feet 7272 were almost 4592 gone; 5186-1|5186-7-k my steps 838 had well nigh 369 slipped. 8210-27

73:3 For I was envious 7065-14 at the foolish, 1984-6 [when] I saw 7200-4 the prosperity 7965 of the wicked. 7563

73:4 For [there are] no bands 2784 in their death: 4194 but their strength 193 [is] firm. 1277

73:5 They [are] not in trouble 5999 [as other] men; 582 neither are they plagued 5060-29 like 5973 [other] men. 120

73:6 Therefore pride 1346 compasseth them about as a chain; 6059-1 violence 2555 covereth 5848-4 them [as] a garment. 7897

73:7 Their eyes 5869 stand out 3318-1 with fatness: 2459 they have more 5674-1 than heart 3824 could wish. 4906

73:8 They are corrupt, 4167-55 and speak 1696-17 wickedly 7451 [concerning] oppression: 6233 they speak 1696-17 loftily. 4791

73:9 They set 8371-1 their mouth 6310 against the heavens, 8064 and their tongue 3956 walketh 1980-4 through the earth. 776

73:10 Therefore his people 5971 return 7725-4|7725-55-k hither: 1988 and waters 4325 of a full 4392 [cup] are wrung out 4680-11 to them.

73:11 And they say, 559-1 How doth God 410 know? 3045-1 and is there 3426 knowledge 1844 in the most High? 5945

73:12 Behold, these [are] the ungodly, 7563 who prosper 7961 in the world; 5769 they increase 7685-52 [in] riches. 2428

73:13 Verily I have cleansed 2135-14 my heart 3824 [in] vain, 7385 and washed 7364-4 my hands 3709 in innocency. 5356

73:14 For all the day 3117 long have I been plagued, 5060-7 and chastened 8433 every morning. 1242

73:15 If I say, 559-1 I will speak 5608-17 thus; 3644 behold, I should offend 898-1 [against] the generation 1755 of thy children. 1121

73:16 When I thought 2803-17 to know 3045-2 this, it [was] too painful 5999 for me; 5869

73:17 Until I went 935-4 into the sanctuary 4720 of God; 410 [then] understood 995-4 I their end. 319

73:18 Surely thou didst set 7896-4 them in slippery places: 2513 thou castedst them down 5307-52 into destruction. 4876

73:19 How are they [brought] into desolation, 8047 as in a moment! 7281 they are utterly 5486-1 consumed 8552-1 with terrors. 1091

73:20 As a dream 2472 when [one] awaketh; 6974-53 [so], O Lord, 136 when thou awakest, 5782 thou shalt despise 959-4 their image. 6754

73:21 Thus my heart 3824 was grieved, 2556-101 and I was pricked 8150-113 in my reins. 3629

73:22 So foolish 1198 [was] I, and ignorant: 3808 3045-4 I was [as] a beast 929 before thee.

73:23 Nevertheless I [am] continually 8548 with thee: thou hast holden 270-1 [me] by my right 3225 hand. 3027

73:24 Thou shalt guide 5148-55 me with thy counsel, 6098 and afterward 310 receive 3947-4 me [to] glory. 3519

73:25 Whom have I in heaven 8064 [but thee]? and [there is] none upon earth 776 [that] I desire 2654-1 beside thee.

73:26 My flesh 7607 and my heart 3824 faileth: 3615-1 [but] God 430 [is] the strength 6697 of my heart, 3824 and my portion 2506 for ever. 5769

73:27 For, lo, they that are far 7369 from thee shall perish: 6-4 thou hast destroyed 6789-52 all them that go a whoring 2181-6 from thee.

73:28 But 589 [it is] good 2896 for me to draw near 7132 to God: 430 I have put 7896-1 my trust 4268 in the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 that I may declare 5608-15 all thy works. 4399

74:1 <Maschil 4905|7919-56 of Asaph.> 623 O God, 430 why hast thou cast [us] off 2186-1 for ever? 5331 [why] doth thine anger 639 smoke 6225-4 against the sheep 6629 of thy pasture? 4830

74:2 Remember 2142-3 thy congregation, 5712 [which] thou hast purchased 7069-1 of old; 6924 the rod 7626 of thine inheritance, 5159 [which] thou hast redeemed; 1350-1 this mount 2022 Zion, 6726 wherein thou hast dwelt. 7931-1

74:3 Lift up 7311-54 thy feet 6471 unto the perpetual 5331 desolations; 4876 [even] all [that] the enemy 341-6 hath done wickedly 7489-52 in the sanctuary. 6944

74:4 Thine enemies 6887-6 roar 7580-1 in the midst 7130 of thy congregations; 4150 they set up 7760-1 their ensigns 226 [for] signs. 226

74:5 [A man] was famous 3045-11 according as he had lifted 935-56 up 4605 axes 7134 upon the thick 5442 trees. 6086

74:6 But now they break down 1986-4 the carved work 6603 thereof at once 3162 with axes 3781 and hammers. 3597

74:7 They have cast 7971-14 fire 784 into thy sanctuary, 4720 they have defiled 2490-14 [by casting down] the dwelling place 4908 of thy name 8034 to the ground. 776

74:8 They said 559-1 in their hearts, 3820 Let us destroy 3238-4 them together: 3162 they have burned up 8313-1 all the synagogues 4150 of God 410 in the land. 776

74:9 We see 7200-1 not our signs: 226 [there is] no more any prophet: 5030 neither [is there] among us any that knoweth 3045-6 how long. 5704

74:10 O God, 430 how long shall the adversary 6862 reproach? 2778-17 shall the enemy 341-6 blaspheme 5006-17 thy name 8034 for ever? 5331

74:11 Why withdrawest 7725-55 thou thy hand, 3027 even thy right hand? 3225 pluck 3615-16 [it] out of 7130 thy bosom. 2436|2436-k

74:12 For God 430 [is] my King 4428 of old, 6924 working 6466-6 salvation 3444 in the midst 7130 of the earth. 776

74:13 Thou didst divide 6565-22 the sea 3220 by thy strength: 5797 thou brakest 7665-14 the heads 7218 of the dragons 8577 in the waters. 4325

74:14 Thou brakest 7533-14 the heads 7218 of leviathan 3882 in pieces, [and] gavest 5414-4 him [to be] meat 3978 to the people 5971 inhabiting the wilderness. 6728

74:15 Thou didst cleave 1234-1 the fountain 4599 and the flood: 5158 thou driedst up 3001-52 mighty 386 rivers. 5104

74:16 The day 3117 [is] thine, the night 3915 also [is] thine: thou hast prepared 3559-52 the light 3974 and the sun. 8121

74:17 Thou hast set 5324-52 all the borders 1367 of the earth: 776 thou hast made 3335-1 summer 7019 and winter. 2779

74:18 Remember 2142-3 this, [that] the enemy 341-6 hath reproached, 2778-14 O LORD, 3068 and [that] the foolish 5036 people 5971 have blasphemed 5006-14 thy name. 8034

74:19 O deliver 5414-4 not the soul 5315 of thy turtledove 8449 unto the multitude 2416 [of the wicked]: forget 7911-4 not the congregation 2416 of thy poor 6041 for ever. 5331

74:20 Have respect 5027-54 unto the covenant: 1285 for the dark places 4285 of the earth 776 are full 4390-1 of the habitations 4999 of cruelty. 2555

74:21 O let not the oppressed 1790 return 7725-4 ashamed: 3637-12 let the poor 6041 and needy 34 praise 1984-17 thy name. 8034

74:22 Arise, 6965-3 O God, 430 plead 7378-3 thine own cause: 7379 remember 2142-3 how the foolish man 5036 reproacheth 2781 thee daily. 3117

74:23 Forget 7911-4 not the voice 6963 of thine enemies: 6887-6 the tumult 7588 of those that rise up 6965-5 against thee increaseth 5927-6 continually. 8548

75:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 Altaschith, 408|7843-55|516 A Psalm 4210 [or] Song 7892 of Asaph.> 623 Unto thee, O God, 430 do we give thanks, 3034-52 [unto thee] do we give thanks: 3034-52 for [that] thy name 8034 is near 7138 thy wondrous works 6381-12 declare. 5608-14

75:2 When I shall receive 3947-4 the congregation 4150 I will judge 8199-4 uprightly. 4339

75:3 The earth 776 and all the inhabitants 3427-6 thereof are dissolved: 4127-12 I bear up 8505-14 the pillars 5982 of it. Selah. 5542

75:4 I said 559-1 unto the fools, 1984-6 Deal not foolishly: 1984-4 and to the wicked, 7563 Lift not up 7311-55 the horn: 7161

75:5 Lift not up 7311-55 your horn 7161 on high: 4791 speak 1696-17 [not with] a stiff 6277 neck. 6677

75:6 For promotion 7311-53|2022 [cometh] neither from the east, 4161 nor from the west, 4628 nor from the south. 4057

75:7 But God 430 [is] the judge: 8199-6 he putteth down 8213-55 one, and setteth up 7311-55 another.

75:8 For in the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 [there is] a cup, 3563 and the wine 3196 is red; 2560-1 it is full 4392 of mixture; 4538 and he poureth out 5064-55 of the same: 2088 but the dregs 8105 thereof, all the wicked 7563 of the earth 776 shall wring [them] out, 4680-4 [and] drink 8354-4 [them].

75:9 But I will declare 5046-55 for ever; 5769 I will sing praises 2167-17 to the God 430 of Jacob. 3290

75:10 All the horns 7161 of the wicked 7563 also will I cut off; 1438-17 [but] the horns 7161 of the righteous 6662 shall be exalted. 7311-37

76:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 on Neginoth, 5058 A Psalm 4210 [or] Song 7892 of Asaph.> 623 In Judah 3063 [is] God 430 known: 3045-12 his name 8034 [is] great 1419 in Israel. 3478

76:2 In Salem 8004 also is his tabernacle, 5520 and his dwelling place 4585 in Zion. 6726

76:3 There brake 7665-14 he the arrows 7565 of the bow, 7198 the shield, 4043 and the sword, 2719 and the battle. 4421 Selah. 5542

76:4 Thou [art] more glorious 215-12 [and] excellent 117 than the mountains 2042 of prey. 2964

76:5 The stouthearted 47 3820 are spoiled, 7997-113 they have slept 5123-1 their sleep: 8142 and none of the men 582 of might 2428 have found 4672-1 their hands. 3027

76:6 At thy rebuke, 1606 O God 430 of Jacob, 3290 both the chariot 7393 and horse 5483 are cast into a dead sleep. 7290-12

76:7 Thou, [even] thou, [art] to be feared: 3372-12 and who may stand 5975-4 in thy sight 6440 when 227 once thou art angry? 639

76:8 Thou didst cause judgment 1779 to be heard 8085-52 from heaven; 8064 the earth 776 feared, 3372-1 and was still, 8252-1

76:9 When God 430 arose 6965-2 to judgment, 4941 to save 3467-53 all the meek 6035 of the earth. 776 Selah. 5542

76:10 Surely the wrath 2534 of man 120 shall praise 3034-55 thee: the remainder 7611 of wrath 2534 shalt thou restrain. 2296-4

76:11 Vow, 5087-3 and pay 7999-16 unto the LORD 3068 your God: 430 let all that be round about 5439 him bring 2986-55 presents 7862 unto him that ought to be feared. 4172

76:12 He shall cut off 1219-4 the spirit 7307 of princes: 5057 [he is] terrible 3372-12 to the kings 4428 of the earth. 776

77:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 to Jeduthun, 3038 A Psalm 4210 of Asaph.> 623 I cried 6817-4 unto God 430 with my voice, 6963 [even] unto God 430 with my voice; 6963 and he gave ear 238-52 unto me.

77:2 In the day 3117 of my trouble 6869 I sought 1875-1 the Lord: 136 my sore 3027 ran 5064-8 in the night, 3915 and ceased 6313-4 not: my soul 5315 refused 3985-14 to be comforted. 5162-9

77:3 I remembered 2142-4 God, 430 and was troubled: 1993-4 I complained, 7878-4 and my spirit 7307 was overwhelmed. 5848-101 Selah. 5542

77:4 Thou holdest 270-1 mine eyes 5869 waking: 8109 I am so troubled 6470-8 that I cannot speak. 1696-17

77:5 I have considered 2803-14 the days 3117 of old, 6924 the years 8141 of ancient times. 5769

77:6 I call to remembrance 2142-4 my song 5058 in the night: 3915 I commune 7878-4 with mine own heart: 3824 and my spirit 7307 made diligent search. 2664-17

77:7 Will the Lord 136 cast off 2186-4 for ever? 5769 and will he be favourable 7521-2 no more? 3254-55

77:8 Is his mercy 2617 clean gone 656-1 for ever? 5331 doth [his] promise 562 fail 1584-1 for evermore? 1755 1755

77:9 Hath God 410 forgotten 7911-1 to be gracious? 2589-2 hath he in anger 639 shut up 7092-1 his tender mercies? 7356 Selah. 5542

77:10 And I said, 559-4 This [is] my infirmity: 2470-15 [but I will remember] the years 8141 of the right hand 3225 of the most High. 5945

77:11 I will remember 2142-4|2142-55-k the works 4611 of the LORD: 3050 surely I will remember 2142-4 thy wonders 6382 of old. 6924

77:12 I will meditate 1897-1 also of all thy work, 6467 and talk 7878-4 of thy doings. 5949

77:13 Thy way, 1870 O God, 430 [is] in the sanctuary: 6944 who [is so] great 1419 a God 410 as [our] God? 430

77:14 Thou [art] the God 410 that doest 6213-6 wonders: 6382 thou hast declared 3045-52 thy strength 5797 among the people. 5971

77:15 Thou hast with [thine] arm 2220 redeemed 1350-1 thy people, 5971 the sons 1121 of Jacob 3290 and Joseph. 3130 Selah. 5542

77:16 The waters 4325 saw 7200-1 thee, O God, 430 the waters 4325 saw 7200-1 thee; they were afraid: 2342-4 the depths 8415 also were troubled. 7264-4

77:17 The clouds 5645 poured out 2229-19 water: 4325 the skies 7834 sent out 5414-1 a sound: 6963 thine arrows 2687 also went abroad. 1980-101

77:18 The voice 6963 of thy thunder 7482 [was] in the heaven: 1534 the lightnings 1300 lightened 215-52 the world: 8398 the earth 776 trembled 7264-1 and shook. 7493-4

77:19 Thy way 1870 [is] in the sea, 3220 and thy path 7635 in the great 7227 waters, 4325 and thy footsteps 6119 are not known. 3045-8

77:20 Thou leddest 5148-1 thy people 5971 like a flock 6629 by the hand 3027 of Moses 4872 and Aaron. 175

78:1 <Maschil 4905|7919-56 of Asaph.> 623 Give ear, 238-54 O my people, 5971 [to] my law: 8451 incline 5186-54 your ears 241 to the words 561 of my mouth. 6310

78:2 I will open 6605-4 my mouth 6310 in a parable: 4912 I will utter 5042-55 dark sayings 2420 of old: 6924

78:3 Which we have heard 8085-1 and known, 3045-4 and our fathers 1 have told 5608-14 us.

78:4 We will not hide 3582-17 [them] from their children, 1121 shewing 5608-18 to the generation 1755 to come 314 the praises 8416 of the LORD, 3068 and his strength, 5807 and his wonderful works 6381-12 that he hath done. 6213-1

78:5 For he established 6965-55 a testimony 5715 in Jacob, 3290 and appointed 7760-1 a law 8451 in Israel, 3478 which he commanded 6680-14 our fathers, 1 that they should make them known 3045-53 to their children: 1121

78:6 That the generation 1755 to come 314 might know 3045-4 [them, even] the children 1121 [which] should be born; 3205-11 [who] should arise 6965-4 and declare 5608-17 [them] to their children: 1121

78:7 That they might set 7760-4 their hope 3689 in God, 430 and not forget 7911-4 the works 4611 of God, 410 but keep 5341-4 his commandments: 4687

78:8 And might not be as their fathers, 1 a stubborn 5637-6 and rebellious 4784-6 generation; 1755 a generation 1755 [that] set not their heart 3820 aright, 3559-52 and whose spirit 7307 was not stedfast 539-8 with God. 410

78:9 The children 1121 of Ephraim, 669 [being] armed, 5401-6 [and] carrying 7411-6 bows, 7198 turned back 2015-1 in the day 3117 of battle. 7128

78:10 They kept 8104-1 not the covenant 1285 of God, 430 and refused 3985-14 to walk 3212-2 in his law; 8451

78:11 And forgat 7911-4 his works, 5949 and his wonders 6381-12 that he had shewed 7200-52 them.

78:12 Marvellous things 6382 did 6213-1 he in the sight 5048 of their fathers, 1 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 [in] the field 7704 of Zoan. 6814

78:13 He divided 1234-1 the sea, 3220 and caused them to pass through; 5674-55 and he made the waters 4325 to stand 5324-55 as an heap. 5067

78:14 In the daytime 3119 also he led 5148-55 them with a cloud, 6051 and all the night 3915 with a light 216 of fire. 784

78:15 He clave 1234-17 the rocks 6697 in the wilderness, 4057 and gave [them] drink 8248-55 as [out of] the great 7227 depths. 8415

78:16 He brought streams 5140-6 also out 3318-55 of the rock, 5553 and caused waters 4325 to run down 3381-55 like rivers. 5104

78:17 And they sinned 2398-2 yet more 3254-55 against him by provoking 4784-53 the most High 5945 in the wilderness. 6723

78:18 And they tempted 5254-17 God 410 in their heart 3824 by asking 7592-2 meat 400 for their lust. 5315

78:19 Yea, they spake 1696-17 against God; 430 they said, 559-1 Can 3201-4 God 410 furnish 6186-2 a table 7979 in the wilderness? 4057

78:20 Behold, he smote 5221-52 the rock, 6697 that the waters 4325 gushed out, 2100-4 and the streams 5158 overflowed; 7857-4 can 3201-4 he give 5414-2 bread 3899 also? can 518 he provide 3559-55 flesh 7607 for his people? 5971

78:21 Therefore the LORD 3068 heard 8085-1 [this], and was wroth: 5674-101 so a fire 784 was kindled 5400-8 against Jacob, 3290 and anger 639 also came up 5927-1 against Israel; 3478

78:22 Because they believed 539-52 not in God, 430 and trusted 982-1 not in his salvation: 3444

78:23 Though he had commanded 6680-17 the clouds 7834 from above, 4605 and opened 6605-1 the doors 1817 of heaven, 8064

78:24 And had rained 4305-55 down manna 4478 upon them to eat, 398-2 and had given 5414-1 them of the corn 1715 of heaven. 8064

78:25 Man 376 did eat 398-1 angels' 47 food: 3899 he sent 7971-1 them meat 6720 to the full. 7648

78:26 He caused an east wind 6921 to blow 5265-55 in the heaven: 8064 and by his power 5797 he brought 5090-17 in the south wind. 8486

78:27 He rained 4305-55 flesh 7607 also upon them as dust, 6083 and feathered 3671 fowls 5775 like as the sand 2344 of the sea: 3220

78:28 And he let [it] fall 5307-55 in the midst 7130 of their camp, 4264 round about 5439 their habitations. 4908

78:29 So they did eat, 398-4 and were well 3966 filled: 7646-4 for he gave 935-55 them their own desire; 8378

78:30 They were not estranged 2114-1 from their lust. 8378 But while their meat 400 [was] yet in their mouths, 6310

78:31 The wrath 639 of God 430 came 5927-1 upon them, and slew 2026-4 the fattest 4924 of them, and smote down 3766-52 the chosen 970 [men] of Israel. 3478

78:32 For all this they sinned 2398-1 still, and believed 539-52 not for his wondrous works. 6381-12

78:33 Therefore their days 3117 did he consume 3615-17 in vanity, 1892 and their years 8141 in trouble. 928

78:34 When he slew 2026-1 them, then they sought 1875-1 him: and they returned 7725-1 and enquired early 7836-14 after God. 410

78:35 And they remembered 2142-4 that God 430 [was] their rock, 6697 and the high 5945 God 410 their redeemer. 1350-6

78:36 Nevertheless they did flatter 6601-17 him with their mouth, 6310 and they lied 3576-17 unto him with their tongues. 3956

78:37 For their heart 3820 was not right 3559-12 with him, neither were they stedfast 539-8 in his covenant. 1285

78:38 But he, [being] full of compassion, 7349 forgave 3722-17 [their] iniquity, 5771 and destroyed 7843-55 [them] not: yea, many a time 7235-52 turned he his anger 639 away, 7725-53 and did not stir up 5782-55 all his wrath. 2534

78:39 For he remembered 2142-4 that they [were but] flesh; 1320 a wind 7307 that passeth away, 1980-6 and cometh not again. 7725-4

78:40 How oft 4100 did they provoke 4784-55 him in the wilderness, 4057 [and] grieve 6087-55 him in the desert! 3452

78:41 Yea, they turned back 7725-4 and tempted 5254-17 God, 410 and limited 8428-52 the Holy One 6918 of Israel. 3478

78:42 They remembered 2142-1 not his hand, 3027 [nor] the day 3117 when he delivered 6299-1 them from the enemy. 6862

78:43 How he had wrought 7760-1 his signs 226 in Egypt, 4714 and his wonders 4159 in the field 7704 of Zoan: 6814

78:44 And had turned 2015-4 their rivers 2975 into blood; 1818 and their floods, 5140-6 that they could not drink. 8354-4

78:45 He sent 7971-17 divers sorts of flies 6157 among them, which devoured 398-4 them; and frogs, 6854 which destroyed 7843-55 them.

78:46 He gave 5414-4 also their increase 2981 unto the caterpiller, 2625 and their labour 3018 unto the locust. 697

78:47 He destroyed 2026-4 their vines 1612 with hail, 1259 and their sycomore trees 8256 with frost. 2602

78:48 He gave up 5462-55 their cattle 1165 also to the hail, 1259 and their flocks 4735 to hot thunderbolts. 7565

78:49 He cast 7971-17 upon them the fierceness 2740 of his anger, 639 wrath, 5678 and indignation, 2195 and trouble, 6869 by sending 4917 evil 7451 angels 4397 [among them].

78:50 He made 6424-17 a way 5410 to his anger; 639 he spared 2820-1 not their soul 5315 from death, 4194 but gave their life 2416 over 5462-52 to the pestilence; 1698

78:51 And smote 5221-55 all the firstborn 1060 in Egypt; 4714 the chief 7225 of [their] strength 202 in the tabernacles 168 of Ham: 2526

78:52 But made his own people 5971 to go forth 5265-55 like sheep, 6629 and guided 5090-17 them in the wilderness 4057 like a flock. 5739

78:53 And he led 5148-55 them on safely, 983 so that they feared 6342-1 not: but the sea 3220 overwhelmed 3680-14 their enemies. 341-6

78:54 And he brought 935-55 them to the border 1366 of his sanctuary, 6944 [even to] this mountain, 2022 [which] his right hand 3225 had purchased. 7069-1

78:55 He cast out 1644-17 the heathen 1471 also before 6440 them, and divided 5307-55 them an inheritance 5159 by line, 2256 and made the tribes 7626 of Israel 3478 to dwell 7931-55 in their tents. 168

78:56 Yet they tempted 5254-17 and provoked 4784-55 the most high 5945 God, 430 and kept 8104-1 not his testimonies: 5713

78:57 But turned back, 5472-11 and dealt unfaithfully 898-4 like their fathers: 1 they were turned aside 2015-8 like a deceitful 7423 bow. 7198

78:58 For they provoked him to anger 3707-55 with their high places, 1116 and moved him to jealousy 7065-55 with their graven images. 6456

78:59 When God 430 heard 8085-1 [this], he was wroth, 5674-101 and greatly 3966 abhorred 3988-4 Israel: 3478

78:60 So that he forsook 5203-4 the tabernacle 4908 of Shiloh, 7887 the tent 168 [which] he placed 7931-14 among men; 120

78:61 And delivered 5414-4 his strength 5797 into captivity, 7628 and his glory 8597 into the enemy's 6862 hand. 3027

78:62 He gave his people 5971 over 5462-55 also unto the sword; 2719 and was wroth 5674-98 with his inheritance. 5159

78:63 The fire 784 consumed 398-1 their young men; 970 and their maidens 1330 were not given to marriage. 1984-27

78:64 Their priests 3548 fell 5307-1 by the sword; 2719 and their widows 490 made no lamentation. 1058-4

78:65 Then the Lord 136 awaked 3364-4 as one out of sleep, 3463 [and] like a mighty man 1368 that shouteth 7442-114 by reason of wine. 3196

78:66 And he smote 5221-55 his enemies 6862 in the hinder parts: 268 he put 5414-1 them to a perpetual 5769 reproach. 2781

78:67 Moreover he refused 3988-4 the tabernacle 168 of Joseph, 3130 and chose 977-1 not the tribe 7626 of Ephraim: 669

78:68 But chose 977-4 the tribe 7626 of Judah, 3063 the mount 2022 Zion 6726 which he loved. 157-1

78:69 And he built 1129-4 his sanctuary 4720 like high 7311-6 [palaces], like the earth 776 which he hath established 3245-1 for ever. 5769

78:70 He chose 977-4 David 1732 also his servant, 5650 and took 3947-4 him from the sheepfolds: 4356 6629

78:71 From following 310 the ewes great with young 5763-6 he brought 935-52 him to feed 7462-2 Jacob 3290 his people, 5971 and Israel 3478 his inheritance. 5159

78:72 So he fed 7462-55 them according to the integrity 8537 of his heart; 3824 and guided 5148-55 them by the skilfulness 8394 of his hands. 3709

79:1 <A Psalm 4210 of Asaph.> 623 O God, 430 the heathen 1471 are come 935-1 into thine inheritance; 5159 thy holy 6944 temple 1964 have they defiled; 2930-14 they have laid 7760-1 Jerusalem 3389 on heaps. 5856

79:2 The dead bodies 5038 of thy servants 5650 have they given 5414-1 [to be] meat 3978 unto the fowls 5775 of the heaven, 8064 the flesh 1320 of thy saints 2623 unto the beasts 2416 of the earth. 776

79:3 Their blood 1818 have they shed 8210-1 like water 4325 round about 5439 Jerusalem; 3389 and [there was] none to bury 6912-6 [them].

79:4 We are become a reproach 2781 to our neighbours, 7934 a scorn 3933 and derision 7047 to them that are round about 5439 us.

79:5 How long, LORD? 3068 wilt thou be angry 599-4 for ever? 5331 shall thy jealousy 7068 burn 1197-4 like fire? 784

79:6 Pour out 8210-3 thy wrath 2534 upon the heathen 1471 that have not known 3045-1 thee, and upon the kingdoms 4467 that have not called 7121-1 upon thy name. 8034

79:7 For they have devoured 398-1 Jacob, 3290 and laid waste 8074-52 his dwelling place. 5116

79:8 O remember 2142-4 not against us former 7223 iniquities: 5771 let thy tender mercies 7356 speedily 4118 prevent 6923-17 us: for we are brought very 3966 low. 1809-1

79:9 Help 5826-3 us, O God 430 of our salvation, 3468 for 1697 the glory 3519 of thy name: 8034 and deliver 5337-54 us, and purge away 3722-16 our sins, 2403 for thy name's 8034 sake.

79:10 Wherefore should the heathen 1471 say, 559-4 Where [is] their God? 430 let him be known 3045-11 among the heathen 1471 in our sight 5869 [by] the revenging 5360 of the blood 1818 of thy servants 5650 [which is] shed. 8210-7

79:11 Let the sighing 603 of the prisoner 615 come 935-4 before 6440 thee; according to the greatness 1433 of thy power 2220 preserve 3498-54 thou those that are appointed 1121 to die; 8546

79:12 And render 7725-54 unto our neighbours 7934 sevenfold 7659 into their bosom 2436 their reproach, 2781 wherewith they have reproached 2778-14 thee, O Lord. 136

79:13 So we thy people 5971 and sheep 6629 of thy pasture 4830 will give thee thanks 3034-55 for ever: 5769 we will shew forth 5608-17 thy praise 8416 to all 1755 generations. 1755

80:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 upon Shoshannimeduth, 7799|5715|7802 A Psalm 4210 of Asaph.> 623 Give ear, 238-54 O Shepherd 7462-6 of Israel, 3478 thou that leadest 5090-6 Joseph 3130 like a flock; 6629 thou that dwellest 3427-6 [between] the cherubims, 3742 shine forth. 3313-54

80:2 Before 6440 Ephraim 669 and Benjamin 1144 and Manasseh 4519 stir up 5782-33 thy strength, 1369 and come 3212-3 [and] save 3444 us.

80:3 Turn us again, 7725-54 O God, 430 and cause thy face 6440 to shine; 215-54 and we shall be saved. 3467-11

80:4 O LORD 3068 God 430 of hosts, 6635 how long wilt thou be angry 6225-1 against the prayer 8605 of thy people? 5971

80:5 Thou feedest 398-52 them with the bread 3899 of tears; 1832 and givest them tears 1832 to drink 8248-55 in great measure. 7991

80:6 Thou makest 7760-4 us a strife 4066 unto our neighbours: 7934 and our enemies 341-6 laugh 3932-4 among themselves.

80:7 Turn us again, 7725-54 O God 430 of hosts, 6635 and cause thy face 6440 to shine; 215-54 and we shall be saved. 3467-11

80:8 Thou hast brought 5265-55 a vine 1612 out of Egypt: 4714 thou hast cast out 1644-17 the heathen, 1471 and planted 5193-4 it.

80:9 Thou preparedst 6437-14 [room] before 6440 it, and didst cause it to take deep 8328 root, 8327-55 and it filled 4390-17 the land. 776

80:10 The hills 2022 were covered 3680-27 with the shadow 6738 of it, and the boughs 6057 thereof [were like] the goodly 410 cedars. 730

80:11 She sent out 7971-17 her boughs 7105 unto the sea, 3220 and her branches 3127 unto the river. 5104

80:12 Why hast thou [then] broken down 6555-1 her hedges, 1447 so that all they which pass by 5674-6 the way 1870 do pluck 717-1 her?

80:13 The boar 2386 out of the wood 3293 doth waste 3765-17 it, and the wild beast 2123 of the field 7704 doth devour 7462-4 it.

80:14 Return, 7725-3 we beseech thee, O God 430 of hosts: 6635 look down 5027-54 from heaven, 8064 and behold, 7200-3 and visit 6485-3 this vine; 1612

80:15 And the vineyard 3657|3661-3 which thy right hand 3225 hath planted, 5193-1 and the branch 1121 [that] thou madest strong 553-14 for thyself.

80:16 [It is] burned 8313-7 with fire, 784 [it is] cut down: 3683-7 they perish 6-4 at the rebuke 1606 of thy countenance. 6440

80:17 Let thy hand 3027 be upon the man 376 of thy right hand, 3225 upon the son 1121 of man 120 [whom] thou madest strong 553-14 for thyself.

80:18 So will not we go back 5472-4 from thee: quicken 2421-17 us, and we will call 7121-4 upon thy name. 8034

80:19 Turn us again, 7725-54 O LORD 3068 God 430 of hosts, 6635 cause thy face 6440 to shine; 215-54 and we shall be saved. 3467-11

81:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 upon Gittith, 1665 [A Psalm] of Asaph.> 623 Sing aloud 7442-54 unto God 430 our strength: 5797 make a joyful noise 7321-54 unto the God 430 of Jacob. 3290

81:2 Take 5375-3 a psalm, 2172 and bring 5414-3 hither the timbrel, 8596 the pleasant 5273 harp 3658 with the psaltery. 5035

81:3 Blow 8628-3 up the trumpet 7782 in the new moon, 2320 in the time appointed, 3677 on our solemn feast 2282 day. 3117

81:4 For this [was] a statute 2706 for Israel, 3478 [and] a law 4941 of the God 430 of Jacob. 3290

81:5 This he ordained 7760-1 in Joseph 3084 [for] a testimony, 5715 when he went out 3318-2 through the land 776 of Egypt: 4714 [where] I heard 8085-4 a language 8193 [that] I understood 3045-1 not.

81:6 I removed 5493-52 his shoulder 7926 from the burden: 5447 his hands 3709 were delivered 5674-4 from the pots. 1731

81:7 Thou calledst 7121-1 in trouble, 6869 and I delivered 2502-17 thee; I answered 6030-4 thee in the secret place 5643 of thunder: 7482 I proved 974-4 thee at the waters 4325 of Meribah. 4809 Selah. 5542

81:8 Hear, 8085-3 O my people, 5971 and I will testify 5749-55 unto thee: O Israel, 3478 if thou wilt hearken 8085-4 unto me;

81:9 There shall no strange 2114-5 god 410 be in thee; neither shalt thou worship 7812-101 any strange 5236 god. 410

81:10 I [am] the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 which brought 5927-56 thee out of the land 776 of Egypt: 4714 open thy mouth 6310 wide, 7337-54 and I will fill 4390-17 it.

81:11 But my people 5971 would not hearken 8085-1 to my voice; 6963 and Israel 3478 would 14-1 none of me.

81:12 So I gave them up 7971-17 unto their own hearts' 3820 lust: 8307 [and] they walked 3212-4 in their own counsels. 4156

81:13 Oh that 3863 my people 5971 had hearkened 8085-6 unto me, [and] Israel 3478 had walked 1980-17 in my ways! 1870

81:14 I should soon 4592 have subdued 3665-55 their enemies, 341-6 and turned 7725-55 my hand 3027 against their adversaries. 6862

81:15 The haters 8130-18 of the LORD 3068 should have submitted 3584-17 themselves unto him: but their time 6256 should have endured for ever. 5769

81:16 He should have fed 398-55 them also with the finest 2459 of the wheat: 2406 and with honey 1706 out of the rock 6697 should I have satisfied 7646-55 thee.

82:1 <A Psalm 4210 of Asaph.> 623 God 430 standeth 5324-12 in the congregation 5712 of the mighty; 410 he judgeth 8199-4 among 7130 the gods. 430

82:2 How long will ye judge 8199-4 unjustly, 5766 and accept 5375-4 the persons 6440 of the wicked? 7563 Selah. 5542

82:3 Defend 8199-3 the poor 1800 and fatherless: 3490 do justice 6663-54 to the afflicted 6041 and needy. 7326-6

82:4 Deliver 6403-16 the poor 1800 and needy: 34 rid 5337-54 [them] out of the hand 3027 of the wicked. 7563

82:5 They know 3045-1 not, neither will they understand; 995-4 they walk 1980-101 on in darkness: 2825 all the foundations 4144 of the earth 776 are out of course. 4131-11

82:6 I have said, 559-1 Ye [are] gods; 430 and all of you [are] children 1121 of the most High. 5945

82:7 But 403 ye shall die 4191-4 like men, 120 and fall 5307-4 like one 259 of the princes. 8269

82:8 Arise, 6965-3 O God, 430 judge 8199-3 the earth: 776 for thou shalt inherit 5157-4 all nations. 1471

83:1 <A Song 7892 [or] Psalm 4210 of Asaph.> 623 Keep not thou silence, 1824 O God: 430 hold not thy peace, 2790-4 and be not still, 8252-4 O God. 410

83:2 For, lo, thine enemies 341-6 make a tumult: 1993-4 and they that hate 8130-18 thee have lifted up 5375-1 the head. 7218

83:3 They have taken crafty 6191-55 counsel 5475 against thy people, 5971 and consulted 3289-101 against thy hidden ones. 6845-7

83:4 They have said, 559-1 Come, 3212-3 and let us cut them off 3582-55 from [being] a nation; 1471 that the name 8034 of Israel 3478 may be no more in remembrance. 2142-11

83:5 For they have consulted 3289-8 together 3162 with one consent: 3820 they are 3772-4 confederate 1285 against thee:

83:6 The tabernacles 168 of Edom, 123 and the Ishmaelites; 3459 of Moab, 4124 and the Hagarenes; 1905

83:7 Gebal, 1381 and Ammon, 5983 and Amalek; 6002 the Philistines 6429 with the inhabitants 3427-6 of Tyre; 6865

83:8 Assur 804 also is joined 3867-8 with them: they have holpen 2220 the children 1121 of Lot. 3876 Selah. 5542

83:9 Do 6213-3 unto them as [unto] the Midianites; 4080 as [to] Sisera, 5516 as [to] Jabin, 2985 at the brook 5158 of Kison: 7028

83:10 [Which] perished 8045-8 at Endor: 5874 they became [as] dung 1828 for the earth. 127

83:11 Make 7896-3 their nobles 5081 like Oreb, 6159 and like Zeeb: 2062 yea, all their princes 5257 as Zebah, 2078 and as Zalmunna: 6759

83:12 Who said, 559-1 Let us take to ourselves the houses 4999 of God 430 in possession. 3423-4

83:13 O my God, 430 make 7896-3 them like a wheel; 1534 as the stubble 7179 before 6440 the wind. 7307

83:14 As the fire 784 burneth 1197-4 a wood, 3293 and as the flame 3852 setteth the mountains 2022 on fire; 3857-17

83:15 So persecute 7291-4 them with thy tempest, 5591 and make them afraid 926-17 with thy storm. 5492

83:16 Fill 4390-16 their faces 6440 with shame; 7036 that they may seek 1245-17 thy name, 8034 O LORD. 3068

83:17 Let them be confounded 954-4 and troubled 926-11 for ever; 5703 yea, let them be put to shame, 2659-4 and perish: 6-4

83:18 That [men] may know 3045-4 that thou, whose name 8034 alone [is] JEHOVAH, 3068 [art] the most high 5945 over all the earth. 776

84:1 <To the chief Musician 5329-18 upon Gittith, 1665 A Psalm 4210 for the sons 1121 of Korah.> 7141 How amiable 3039 [are] thy tabernacles, 4908 O LORD 3068 of hosts! 6635

84:2 My soul 5315 longeth, 3700-8 yea, even fainteth 3615-1 for the courts 2691 of the LORD: 3068 my heart 3820 and my flesh 1320 crieth out 7442-17 for the living 2416 God. 410

84:3 Yea, the sparrow 6833 hath found 4672-1 an house, 1004 and the swallow 1866 a nest 7064 for herself, where she may lay 7896-1 her young, 667 [even] thine altars, 4196 O LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 my King, 4428 and my God. 430

84:4 Blessed 835 [are] they that dwell 3427-6 in thy house: 1004 they will be still praising 1984-17 thee. Selah. 5542

84:5 Blessed 835 [is] the man 120 whose strength 5797 [is] in thee; in whose heart 3824 [are] the ways 4546 [of them].

84:6 [Who] passing 5674-6 through the valley 6010 of Baca 1056|1057 make 7896-4 it a well; 4599 the rain 4175 also filleth 5844-4 the pools. 1293

84:7 They go 3212-4 from strength 2428 to strength, 2428 [every one of them] in Zion 6726 appeareth 7200-11 before God. 430

84:8 O LORD 3068 God 430 of hosts, 6635 hear 8085-3 my prayer: 8605 give ear, 238-54 O God 430 of Jacob. 3290 Selah. 5542

84:9 Behold, 7200-3 O God 430 our shield, 4043 and look upon 5027-54 the face 6440 of thine anointed. 4899

84:10 For a day 3117 in thy courts 2691 [is] better 2896 than a thousand. 505 I had rather 977-1 be a doorkeeper 5605-106 in the house 1004 of my God, 430 than to dwell 1752-2 in the tents 168 of wickedness. 7562

84:11 For the LORD 3068 God 430 [is] a sun 8121 and shield: 4043 the LORD 3068 will give 5414-4 grace 2580 and glory: 3519 no good 2896 [thing] will he withhold 4513-4 from them that walk 1980-6 uprightly. 8549

84:12 O LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 blessed 835 [is] the man 120 that trusteth 982-6 in thee.

85:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 A Psalm 4210 for the sons 1121 of Korah.> 7141 LORD, 3068 thou hast been favourable 7521-1 unto thy land: 776 thou hast brought back 7725-1 the captivity 7622|7622-k of Jacob. 3290

85:2 Thou hast forgiven 5375-1 the iniquity 5771 of thy people, 5971 thou hast covered 3680-14 all their sin. 2403 Selah. 5542

85:3 Thou hast taken away 622-1 all thy wrath: 5678 thou hast turned 7725-52 [thyself] from the fierceness 2740 of thine anger. 639

85:4 Turn 7725-3 us, O God 430 of our salvation, 3468 and cause thine anger 3708 toward us to cease. 6565-54

85:5 Wilt thou be angry 599-4 with us for ever? 5769 wilt thou draw out 4900-4 thine anger 639 to all 1755 generations? 1755

85:6 Wilt thou not revive 2421-17 us again: 7725-4 that thy people 5971 may rejoice 8055-4 in thee?

85:7 Shew 7200-54 us thy mercy, 2617 O LORD, 3068 and grant 5414-4 us thy salvation. 3468

85:8 I will hear 8085-4 what God 410 the LORD 3068 will speak: 1696-17 for he will speak 1696-17 peace 7965 unto his people, 5971 and to his saints: 2623 but let them not turn again 7725-4 to folly. 3690

85:9 Surely his salvation 3468 [is] nigh 7138 them that fear 3373 him; that glory 3519 may dwell 7931-2 in our land. 776

85:10 Mercy 2617 and truth 571 are met 6298-8 together; righteousness 6664 and peace 7965 have kissed 5401-1 [each other].

85:11 Truth 571 shall spring 6779-4 out of the earth; 776 and righteousness 6664 shall look down 8259-8 from heaven. 8064

85:12 Yea, the LORD 3068 shall give 5414-4 [that which is] good; 2896 and our land 776 shall yield 5414-4 her increase. 2981

85:13 Righteousness 6664 shall go 1980-17 before 6440 him; and shall set 7760-4 [us] in the way 1870 of his steps. 6471

86:1 <A Prayer 8605 of David.> 1732 Bow down 5186-54 thine ear, 241 O LORD, 3068 hear 6030-3 me: for I [am] poor 6041 and needy. 34

86:2 Preserve 8104-3 my soul; 5315 for I [am] holy: 2623 O thou my God, 430 save 3467-54 thy servant 5650 that trusteth 982-6 in thee.

86:3 Be merciful 2603-3 unto me, O Lord: 136 for I cry 7121-4 unto thee daily. 3117

86:4 Rejoice 8055-16 the soul 5315 of thy servant: 5650 for unto thee, O Lord, 136 do I lift up 5375-4 my soul. 5315

86:5 For thou, Lord, 136 [art] good, 2896 and ready to forgive; 5546 and plenteous 7227 in mercy 2617 unto all them that call 7121-6 upon thee.

86:6 Give ear, 238-54 O LORD, 3068 unto my prayer; 8605 and attend 7181-54 to the voice 6963 of my supplications. 8469

86:7 In the day 3117 of my trouble 6869 I will call 7121-4 upon thee: for thou wilt answer 6030-4 me.

86:8 Among the gods 430 [there is] none like unto thee, O Lord; 136 neither [are there any works] like unto thy works. 4639

86:9 All nations 1471 whom thou hast made 6213-1 shall come 935-4 and worship 7812-101 before 6440 thee, O Lord; 136 and shall glorify 3513-17 thy name. 8034

86:10 For thou [art] great, 1419 and doest 6213-6 wondrous things: 6381-12 thou [art] God 430 alone.

86:11 Teach 3384-54 me thy way, 1870 O LORD; 3068 I will walk 1980-17 in thy truth: 571 unite 3161-16 my heart 3824 to fear 3372-2 thy name. 8034

86:12 I will praise 3034-55 thee, O Lord 136 my God, 430 with all my heart: 3824 and I will glorify 3513-17 thy name 8034 for evermore. 5769

86:13 For great 1419 [is] thy mercy 2617 toward me: and thou hast delivered 5337-52 my soul 5315 from the lowest 8482 hell. 7585

86:14 O God, 430 the proud 2086 are risen 6965-1 against me, and the assemblies 5712 of violent 6184 [men] have sought 1245-14 after my soul; 5315 and have not set 7760-1 thee before them.

86:15 But thou, O Lord, 136 [art] a God 410 full of compassion, 7349 and gracious, 2587 longsuffering, 750 639 and plenteous 7227 in mercy 2617 and truth. 571

86:16 O turn 6437-3 unto me, and have mercy 2603-3 upon me; give 5414-3 thy strength 5797 unto thy servant, 5650 and save 3467-54 the son 1121 of thine handmaid. 519

86:17 Shew 6213-3 me a token 226 for good; 2896 that they which hate 8130-6 me may see 7200-4 [it], and be ashamed: 954-4 because thou, LORD, 3068 hast holpen 5826-1 me, and comforted 5162-14 me.

87:1 <A Psalm 4210 [or] Song 7892 for the sons 1121 of Korah.> 7141 His foundation 3248 [is] in the holy 6944 mountains. 2042

87:2 The LORD 3068 loveth 157-6 the gates 8179 of Zion 6726 more than all the dwellings 4908 of Jacob. 3290

87:3 Glorious things 3513-12 are spoken 1696-30 of thee, O city 5892 of God. 430 Selah. 5542

87:4 I will make mention 2142-55 of Rahab 7294 and Babylon 894 to them that know 3045-6 me: behold Philistia, 6429 and Tyre, 6865 with Ethiopia; 3568 this [man] was born 3205-27 there.

87:5 And of Zion 6726 it shall be said, 559-11 This 376 and that man 376 was born 3205-27 in her: and the highest 5945 himself shall establish 3559-34 her.

87:6 The LORD 3068 shall count, 5608-4 when he writeth up 3789-2 the people, 5971 [that] this [man] was born 3205-27 there. Selah. 5542

87:7 As well the singers 7891-6 as the players 2490-6 on instruments [shall be there]: all my springs 4599 [are] in thee.

88:1 <A Song 7892 [or] Psalm 4210 for the sons 1121 of Korah, 7141 to the chief Musician 5329-18 upon Mahalath 4257 Leannoth, 6031-15 Maschil 4905|7919-56 of Heman 1968 the Ezrahite.> 250 O LORD 3068 God 430 of my salvation, 3444 I have cried 6817-1 day 3117 [and] night 3915 before thee:

88:2 Let my prayer 8605 come 935-4 before 6440 thee: incline 5186-54 thine ear 241 unto my cry; 7440

88:3 For my soul 5315 is full 7646-1 of troubles: 7451 and my life 2416 draweth nigh 5060-52 unto the grave. 7585

88:4 I am counted 2803-8 with them that go down 3381-6 into the pit: 953 I am as a man 1397 [that hath] no strength: 353

88:5 Free 2670 among the dead, 4191-5 like the slain 2491 that lie 7901-6 in the grave, 6913 whom thou rememberest 2142-1 no more: and they are cut off 1504-8 from thy hand. 3027

88:6 Thou hast laid 7896-1 me in the lowest 8482 pit, 953 in darkness, 4285 in the deeps. 4688

88:7 Thy wrath 2534 lieth hard 5564-1 upon me, and thou hast afflicted 6031-14 [me] with all thy waves. 4867 Selah. 5542

88:8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance 3045-30 far 7368-52 from me; thou hast made 7896-1 me an abomination 8441 unto them: [I am] shut up, 3607-7 and I cannot come forth. 3318-4

88:9 Mine eye 5869 mourneth 1669-1 by reason of affliction: 6040 LORD, 3068 I have called 7121-1 daily 3117 upon thee, I have stretched out 7849-14 my hands 3709 unto thee.

88:10 Wilt thou shew 6213-4 wonders 6382 to the dead? 4191-5 shall the dead 7496 arise 6965-4 [and] praise 3034-55 thee? Selah. 5542

88:11 Shall thy lovingkindness 2617 be declared 5608-29 in the grave? 6913 [or] thy faithfulness 530 in destruction? 11

88:12 Shall thy wonders 6382 be known 3045-11 in the dark? 2822 and thy righteousness 6666 in the land 776 of forgetfulness? 5388

88:13 But unto thee have I cried, 7768-14 O LORD; 3068 and in the morning 1242 shall my prayer 8605 prevent 6923-17 thee.

88:14 LORD, 3068 why castest thou off 2186-4 my soul? 5315 [why] hidest 5641-55 thou thy face 6440 from me?

88:15 I [am] afflicted 6041 and ready to die 1478-6 from [my] youth 5290 up: [while] I suffer 5375-1 thy terrors 367 I am distracted. 6323-4

88:16 Thy fierce wrath 2740 goeth over 5674-1 me; thy terrors 1161 have cut me off. 6789-40

88:17 They came round about 5437-1 me daily 3117 like water; 4325 they compassed 5362-52 me about together. 3162

88:18 Lover 157-6 and friend 7453 hast thou put far 7368-52 from me, [and] mine acquaintance 3045-30 into darkness. 4285

89:1 <Maschil 4905|7919-56 of Ethan 387 the Ezrahite.> 250 I will sing 7891-4 of the mercies 2617 of the LORD 3068 for ever: 5769 with my mouth 6310 will I make known 3045-55 thy faithfulness 530 to all 1755 generations. 1755

89:2 For I have said, 559-1 Mercy 2617 shall be built up 1129-11 for ever: 5769 thy faithfulness 530 shalt thou establish 3559-55 in the very heavens. 8064

89:3 I have made 3772-1 a covenant 1285 with my chosen, 972 I have sworn 7650-8 unto David 1732 my servant, 5650

89:4 Thy seed 2233 will I establish 3559-55 for 5704 ever, 5769 and build up 1129-1 thy throne 3678 to all 1755 generations. 1755 Selah. 5542

89:5 And the heavens 8064 shall praise 3034-55 thy wonders, 6382 O LORD: 3068 thy faithfulness 530 also in the congregation 6951 of the saints. 6918

89:6 For who in the heaven 7834 can be compared 6186-4 unto the LORD? 3068 [who] among the sons 1121 of the mighty 410 can be likened 1819-4 unto the LORD? 3068

89:7 God 410 is greatly 7227 to be feared 6206-12 in the assembly 5475 of the saints, 6918 and to be had in reverence 3372-12 of all [them that are] about 5439 him.

89:8 O LORD 3068 God 430 of hosts, 6635 who [is] a strong 2626 LORD 3050 like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness 530 round about 5439 thee?

89:9 Thou rulest 4910-6 the raging 1348 of the sea: 3220 when the waves 1530 thereof arise, 7721-2 thou stillest 7623-17 them.

89:10 Thou hast broken 1792-14 Rahab 7294 in pieces, as one that is slain; 2491 thou hast scattered 6340-14 thine enemies 341-6 with thy strong 5797 arm. 2220

89:11 The heavens 8064 [are] thine, the earth 776 also [is] thine: [as for] the world 8398 and the fulness 4393 thereof, thou hast founded 3245-1 them.

89:12 The north 6828 and the south 3225 thou hast created 1254-1 them: Tabor 8396 and Hermon 2768 shall rejoice 7442-17 in thy name. 8034

89:13 Thou hast a mighty 1369 arm: 2220 strong 5810-4 is thy hand, 3027 [and] high 7311-4 is thy right hand. 3225

89:14 Justice 6664 and judgment 4941 [are] the habitation 4349 of thy throne: 3678 mercy 2617 and truth 571 shall go before 6923-17 thy face. 6440

89:15 Blessed 835 [is] the people 5971 that know 3045-6 the joyful sound: 8643 they shall walk, 1980-17 O LORD, 3068 in the light 216 of thy countenance. 6440

89:16 In thy name 8034 shall they rejoice 1523-4 all the day: 3117 and in thy righteousness 6666 shall they be exalted. 7311-4

89:17 For thou [art] the glory 8597 of their strength: 5797 and in thy favour 7522 our horn 7161 shall be exalted. 7311-4|7311-55-k

89:18 For the LORD 3068 [is] our defence; 4043 and the Holy One 6918 of Israel 3478 [is] our king. 4428

89:19 Then thou spakest 1696-14 in vision 2377 to thy holy one, 2623 and saidst, 559-4 I have laid 7737-14 help 5828 upon [one that is] mighty; 1368 I have exalted 7311-52 [one] chosen 977-7 out of the people. 5971

89:20 I have found 4672-1 David 1732 my servant; 5650 with my holy 6944 oil 8081 have I anointed 4886-1 him:

89:21 With whom my hand 3027 shall be established: 3559-11 mine arm 2220 also shall strengthen 553-17 him.

89:22 The enemy 341-6 shall not exact 5378-55 upon him; nor the son 1121 of wickedness 5766 afflict 6031-17 him.

89:23 And I will beat down 3807-1 his foes 6862 before his face, 6440 and plague 5062-4 them that hate 8130-18 him.

89:24 But my faithfulness 530 and my mercy 2617 [shall be] with him: and in my name 8034 shall his horn 7161 be exalted. 7311-4

89:25 I will set 7760-1 his hand 3027 also in the sea, 3220 and his right hand 3225 in the rivers. 5104

89:26 He shall cry 7121-4 unto me, Thou [art] my father, 1 my God, 410 and the rock 6697 of my salvation. 3444

89:27 Also I will make 5414-4 him [my] firstborn, 1060 higher 5945 than the kings 4428 of the earth. 776

89:28 My mercy 2617 will I keep 8104-4 for him for evermore, 5769 and my covenant 1285 shall stand fast 539-12 with him.

89:29 His seed 2233 also will I make 7760-1 [to endure] for ever, 5703 and his throne 3678 as the days 3117 of heaven. 8064

89:30 If his children 1121 forsake 5800-4 my law, 8451 and walk 3212-4 not in my judgments; 4941

89:31 If they break 2490-17 my statutes, 2708 and keep 8104-4 not my commandments; 4687

89:32 Then will I visit 6485-1 their transgression 6588 with the rod, 7626 and their iniquity 5771 with stripes. 5061

89:33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness 2617 will I not utterly take 6331-55 from him, nor suffer my faithfulness 530 to fail. 8266-17

89:34 My covenant 1285 will I not break, 2490-17 nor alter 8138-17 the thing that is gone out 4161 of my lips. 8193

89:35 Once 259 have I sworn 7650-8 by my holiness 6944 that I will not lie 3576-17 unto David. 1732

89:36 His seed 2233 shall endure for ever, 5769 and his throne 3678 as the sun 8121 before me.

89:37 It shall be established 3559-11 for ever 5769 as the moon, 3394 and [as] a faithful 539-12 witness 5707 in heaven. 7834 Selah. 5542

89:38 But thou hast cast off 2186-1 and abhorred, 3988-4 thou hast been wroth 5674-98 with thine anointed. 4899

89:39 Thou hast made void 5010-14 the covenant 1285 of thy servant: 5650 thou hast profaned 2490-14 his crown 5145 [by casting it] to the ground. 776

89:40 Thou hast broken down 6555-1 all his hedges; 1448 thou hast brought 7760-1 his strong holds 4013 to ruin. 4288

89:41 All that pass by 5674-6 the way 1870 spoil 8155-1 him: he is a reproach 2781 to his neighbours. 7934

89:42 Thou hast set up 7311-52 the right hand 3225 of his adversaries; 6862 thou hast made all his enemies 341-6 to rejoice. 8055-52

89:43 Thou hast also turned 7725-55 the edge 6697 of his sword, 2719 and hast not made him to stand 6965-52 in the battle. 4421

89:44 Thou hast made his glory 2892 to cease, 7673-52 and cast his throne 3678 down 4048-14 to the ground. 776

89:45 The days 3117 of his youth 5934 hast thou shortened: 7114-52 thou hast covered 5844-52 him with shame. 955 Selah. 5542

89:46 How long, LORD? 3068 wilt thou hide 5641-11 thyself for ever? 5331 shall thy wrath 2534 burn 1197-4 like fire? 784

89:47 Remember 2142-3 how short my time 2465 is: wherefore hast thou made 1254-1 all men 1121 120 in vain? 7723

89:48 What man 1397 [is he that] liveth, 2421-4 and shall not see 7200-4 death? 4194 shall he deliver 4422-17 his soul 5315 from the hand 3027 of the grave? 7585 Selah. 5542

89:49 Lord, 136 where [are] thy former 7223 lovingkindnesses, 2617 [which] thou swarest 7650-8 unto David 1732 in thy truth? 530

89:50 Remember, 2142-3 Lord, 136 the reproach 2781 of thy servants; 5650 [how] I do bear 5375-2 in my bosom 2436 [the reproach of] all the mighty 7227 people; 5971

89:51 Wherewith thine enemies 341-6 have reproached, 2778-14 O LORD; 3068 wherewith they have reproached 2778-14 the footsteps 6119 of thine anointed. 4899

89:52 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD 3068 for evermore. 5769 Amen, 543 and Amen. 543

90:1 <A Prayer 8605 of Moses 4872 the man 376 of God.> 430 Lord, 136 thou hast been our dwelling place 4583 in all 1755 generations. 1755

90:2 Before the mountains 2022 were brought forth, 3205-27 or ever thou hadst formed 2342-34 the earth 776 and the world, 8398 even from everlasting 5769 to 5704 everlasting, 5769 thou [art] God. 410

90:3 Thou turnest 7725-55 man 582 to destruction; 1793 and sayest, 559-4 Return, 7725-3 ye children 1121 of men. 120

90:4 For a thousand 505 years 8141 in thy sight 5869 [are but] as yesterday 865 3117 when it is past, 5674-4 and [as] a watch 821 in the night. 3915

90:5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; 2229-1 they are [as] a sleep: 8142 in the morning 1242 [they are] like grass 2682 [which] groweth up. 2498-4

90:6 In the morning 1242 it flourisheth, 6692-55 and groweth up; 2498-1 in the evening 6153 it is cut down, 4135-34 and withereth. 3001-1

90:7 For we are consumed 3615-1 by thine anger, 639 and by thy wrath 2534 are we troubled. 926-8

90:8 Thou hast set 7896-1 our iniquities 5771 before thee, our secret 5956-7 [sins] in the light 3974 of thy countenance. 6440

90:9 For all our days 3117 are passed away 6437-1 in thy wrath: 5678 we spend 3615-14 our years 8141 as a tale 1899 [that is told].

90:10 The days 3117 of our years 8141 [are] threescore years 8141 and ten; 7657 and if by reason of strength 1369 [they be] fourscore 8084 years, 8141 yet [is] their strength 7296 labour 5999 and sorrow; 205 for it is soon 2440 cut off, 1468-1 and we fly away. 5774-4

90:11 Who knoweth 3045-6 the power 5797 of thine anger? 639 even according to thy fear, 3374 [so is] thy wrath. 5678

90:12 So teach 3045-54 [us] to number 4487-2 our days, 3117 that we may apply 935-55 [our] hearts 3824 unto wisdom. 2451

90:13 Return, 7725-3 O LORD, 3068 how long? and let it repent 5162-10 thee concerning thy servants. 5650

90:14 O satisfy 7646-16 us early 1242 with thy mercy; 2617 that we may rejoice 7442-17 and be glad 8055-4 all our days. 3117

90:15 Make us glad 8055-16 according to the days 3117 [wherein] thou hast afflicted 6031-14 us, [and] the years 8141 [wherein] we have seen 7200-1 evil. 7451

90:16 Let thy work 6467 appear 7200-11 unto thy servants, 5650 and thy glory 1926 unto their children. 1121

90:17 And let the beauty 5278 of the LORD 3068 our God 430 be upon us: and establish 3559-33 thou the work 4639 of our hands 3027 upon us; yea, the work 4639 of our hands 3027 establish 3559-33 thou it.

91:1 He that dwelleth 3427-6 in the secret 5643 place of the most High 5945 shall abide 3885-118 under the shadow 6738 of the Almighty. 7706

91:2 I will say 559-4 of the LORD, 3068 [He is] my refuge 4268 and my fortress: 4686 my God; 430 in him will I trust. 982-4

91:3 Surely he shall deliver 5337-55 thee from the snare 6341 of the fowler, 3353 [and] from the noisome 1942 pestilence. 1698

91:4 He shall cover 5526-55 thee with his feathers, 84 and under his wings 3671 shalt thou trust: 2620-4 his truth 571 [shall be thy] shield 6793 and buckler. 5507

91:5 Thou shalt not be afraid 3372-4 for the terror 6343 by night; 3915 [nor] for the arrow 2671 [that] flieth 5774-4 by day; 3119

91:6 [Nor] for the pestilence 1698 [that] walketh 1980-4 in darkness; 652 [nor] for the destruction 6986 [that] wasteth 7736-4 at noonday. 6672

91:7 A thousand 505 shall fall 5307-4 at thy side, 6654 and ten thousand 7233 at thy right hand; 3225 [but] it shall not come nigh 5066-4 thee.

91:8 Only with thine eyes 5869 shalt thou behold 5027-55 and see 7200-4 the reward 8011 of the wicked. 7563

91:9 Because thou hast made 7760-1 the LORD, 3068 [which is] my refuge, 4268 [even] the most High, 5945 thy habitation; 4583

91:10 There shall no evil 7451 befall 579-29 thee, neither shall any plague 5061 come nigh 7126-4 thy dwelling. 168

91:11 For he shall give his angels 4397 charge 6680-17 over thee, to keep 8104-2 thee in all thy ways. 1870

91:12 They shall bear thee up 5375-4 in [their] hands, 3709 lest thou dash 5062-4 thy foot 7272 against a stone. 68

91:13 Thou shalt tread 1869-4 upon the lion 7826 and adder: 6620 the young lion 3715 and the dragon 8577 shalt thou trample under feet. 7429-4

91:14 Because he hath set his love 2836-1 upon me, therefore will I deliver 6403-17 him: I will set him on high, 7682-17 because he hath known 3045-1 my name. 8034

91:15 He shall call 7121-4 upon me, and I will answer 6030-4 him: I [will be] with him in trouble; 6869 I will deliver 2502-17 him, and honour 3513-17 him.

91:16 With long 753 life 3117 will I satisfy 7646-55 him, and shew 7200-55 him my salvation. 3444

92:1 <A Psalm 4210 [or] Song 7892 for the sabbath 7676 day.> 3117 [It is a] good 2896 [thing] to give thanks 3034-53 unto the LORD, 3068 and to sing praises 2167-15 unto thy name, 8034 O most High: 5945

92:2 To shew forth 5046-53 thy lovingkindness 2617 in the morning, 1242 and thy faithfulness 530 every night, 3915

92:3 Upon an instrument of ten 6218 strings, and upon the psaltery; 5035 upon the harp 3658 with a solemn sound. 1902

92:4 For thou, LORD, 3068 hast made me glad 8055-14 through thy work: 6467 I will triumph 7442-17 in the works 4639 of thy hands. 3027

92:5 O LORD, 3068 how great 1431-1 are thy works! 4639 [and] thy thoughts 4284 are very 3966 deep. 6009-1

92:6 A brutish 1198 man 376 knoweth 3045-4 not; neither doth a fool 3684 understand 995-4 this.

92:7 When the wicked 7563 spring 6524-2 as the grass, 6212 and when all the workers 6466-6 of iniquity 205 do flourish; 6692-55 [it is] that they shall be destroyed 8045-9 for ever: 5703

92:8 But thou, LORD, 3068 [art most] high 4791 for evermore. 5769

92:9 For, lo, thine enemies, 341-6 O LORD, 3068 for, lo, thine enemies 341-6 shall perish; 6-4 all the workers 6466-6 of iniquity 205 shall be scattered. 6504-101

92:10 But my horn 7161 shalt thou exalt 7311-55 like [the horn of] an unicorn: 7214 I shall be anointed 1101-1 with fresh 7488 oil. 8081

92:11 Mine eye 5869 also shall see 5027-55 [my desire] on mine enemies, 7790 [and] mine ears 241 shall hear 8085-4 [my desire] of the wicked 7489-56 that rise up 6965-5 against me.

92:12 The righteous 6662 shall flourish 6524-4 like the palm tree: 8558 he shall grow 7685-4 like a cedar 730 in Lebanon. 3844

92:13 Those that be planted 8362-7 in the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 shall flourish 6524-55 in the courts 2691 of our God. 430

92:14 They shall still bring forth fruit 5107-4 in old age; 7872 they shall be fat 1879 and flourishing; 7488

92:15 To shew 5046-53 that the LORD 3068 [is] upright: 3477 [he is] my rock, 6697 and [there is] no unrighteousness 5766 in him.

93:1 The LORD 3068 reigneth, 4427-1 he is clothed 3847-1 with majesty; 1348 the LORD 3068 is clothed 3847-1 with strength, 5797 [wherewith] he hath girded 247-98 himself: the world 8398 also is stablished, 3559-11 that it cannot be moved. 4131-11

93:2 Thy throne 3678 [is] established 3559-12 of old: 227 thou [art] from everlasting. 5769

93:3 The floods 5104 have lifted up, 5375-1 O LORD, 3068 the floods 5104 have lifted up 5375-1 their voice; 6963 the floods 5104 lift up 5375-4 their waves. 1796

93:4 The LORD 3068 on high 4791 [is] mightier 117 than the noise 6963 of many 7227 waters, 4325 [yea, than] the mighty 117 waves 4867 of the sea. 3220

93:5 Thy testimonies 5713 are very 3966 sure: 539-8 holiness 6944 becometh 4998-43 thine house, 1004 O LORD, 3068 for ever. 753 3117

94:1 O LORD 3068 God, 410 to whom vengeance 5360 belongeth; O God, 410 to whom vengeance 5360 belongeth, shew 3313-54 thyself.

94:2 Lift up 5375-10 thyself, thou judge 8199-6 of the earth: 776 render 7725-54 a reward 1576 to the proud. 1343

94:3 LORD, 3068 how long shall the wicked, 7563 how long shall the wicked 7563 triumph? 5937-4

94:4 [How long] shall they utter 5042-55 [and] speak 1696-17 hard things? 6277 [and] all the workers 6466-6 of iniquity 205 boast 559-101 themselves?

94:5 They break in pieces 1792-17 thy people, 5971 O LORD, 3068 and afflict 6031-17 thine heritage. 5159

94:6 They slay 2026-4 the widow 490 and the stranger, 1616 and murder 7523-17 the fatherless. 3490

94:7 Yet they say, 559-4 The LORD 3050 shall not see, 7200-4 neither shall the God 430 of Jacob 3290 regard 995-4 [it].

94:8 Understand, 995-3 ye brutish 1197-6 among the people: 5971 and [ye] fools, 3684 when will ye be wise? 7919-55

94:9 He that planted 5193-6 the ear, 241 shall he not hear? 8085-4 he that formed 3335-6 the eye, 5869 shall he not see? 5027-55

94:10 He that chastiseth 3256-6 the heathen, 1471 shall not he correct? 3198-55 he that teacheth 3925-18 man 120 knowledge, 1847 [shall not he know]?

94:11 The LORD 3068 knoweth 3045-6 the thoughts 4284 of man, 120 that they [are] vanity. 1892

94:12 Blessed 835 [is] the man 1397 whom thou chastenest, 3256-17 O LORD, 3050 and teachest 3925-17 him out of thy law; 8451

94:13 That thou mayest give him rest 8252-53 from the days 3117 of adversity, 7451 until the pit 7845 be digged 3738-11 for the wicked. 7563

94:14 For the LORD 3068 will not cast off 5203-4 his people, 5971 neither will he forsake 5800-4 his inheritance. 5159

94:15 But judgment 4941 shall return 7725-4 unto righteousness: 6664 and all the upright 3477 in heart 3820 shall follow 310 it.

94:16 Who will rise up 6965-4 for me against the evildoers? 7489-56 [or] who will stand up 3320-101 for me against the workers 6466-6 of iniquity? 205

94:17 Unless 3884 the LORD 3068 [had been] my help, 5833 my soul 5315 had almost 4592 dwelt 7931-1 in silence. 1745

94:18 When I said, 559-1 My foot 7272 slippeth; 4131-1 thy mercy, 2617 O LORD, 3068 held me up. 5582-4

94:19 In the multitude 7230 of my thoughts 8312 within 7130 me thy comforts 8575 delight 8173-46 my soul. 5315

94:20 Shall the throne 3678 of iniquity 1942 have fellowship 2266-29 with thee, which frameth 3335-6 mischief 5999 by a law? 2706

94:21 They gather themselves together 1413-4 against the soul 5315 of the righteous, 6662 and condemn 7561-55 the innocent 5355 blood. 1818

94:22 But the LORD 3068 is my defence; 4869 and my God 430 [is] the rock 6697 of my refuge. 4268

94:23 And he shall bring 7725-55 upon them their own iniquity, 205 and shall cut them off 6789-55 in their own wickedness; 7451 [yea], the LORD 3068 our God 430 shall cut them off. 6789-55

95:1 O come, 3212-3 let us sing 7442-17 unto the LORD: 3068 let us make a joyful noise 7321-55 to the rock 6697 of our salvation. 3468

95:2 Let us come before 6923-17 his presence 6440 with thanksgiving, 8426 and make a joyful noise 7321-55 unto him with psalms. 2158

95:3 For the LORD 3068 [is] a great 1419 God, 410 and a great 1419 King 4428 above all gods. 430

95:4 In his hand 3027 [are] the deep places 4278 of the earth: 776 the strength 8443 of the hills 2022 [is] his also.

95:5 The sea 3220 [is] his, and he made 6213-1 it: and his hands 3027 formed 3335-1 the dry 3006 [land].

95:6 O come, 935-3 let us worship 7812-101 and bow down: 3766-4 let us kneel 1288-4 before 6440 the LORD 3068 our maker. 6213-6

95:7 For he [is] our God; 430 and we [are] the people 5971 of his pasture, 4830 and the sheep 6629 of his hand. 3027 To day 3117 if ye will hear 8085-4 his voice, 6963

95:8 Harden 7185-55 not your heart, 3824 as in the provocation, 4808 [and] as [in] the day 3117 of temptation 4531 in the wilderness: 4057

95:9 When your fathers 1 tempted 5254-14 me, proved 974-1 me, and saw 7200-1 my work. 6467

95:10 Forty 705 years 8141 long was I grieved 6962-4 with [this] generation, 1755 and said, 559-4 It [is] a people 5971 that do err 8582-6 in their heart, 3824 and they have not known 3045-1 my ways: 1870

95:11 Unto whom I sware 7650-8 in my wrath 639 that they should not enter 935-4 into my rest. 4496

96:1 O sing 7891-3 unto the LORD 3068 a new 2319 song: 7892 sing 7891-3 unto the LORD, 3068 all the earth. 776

96:2 Sing 7891-3 unto the LORD, 3068 bless 1288-16 his name; 8034 shew forth 1319-16 his salvation 3444 from day 3117 to day. 3117

96:3 Declare 5608-16 his glory 3519 among the heathen, 1471 his wonders 6381-12 among all people. 5971

96:4 For the LORD 3068 [is] great, 1419 and greatly 3966 to be praised: 1984-30 he [is] to be feared 3372-12 above all gods. 430

96:5 For all the gods 430 of the nations 5971 [are] idols: 457 but the LORD 3068 made 6213-1 the heavens. 8064

96:6 Honour 1935 and majesty 1926 [are] before 6440 him: strength 5797 and beauty 8597 [are] in his sanctuary. 4720

96:7 Give 3051-3 unto the LORD, 3068 O ye kindreds 4940 of the people, 5971 give 3051-3 unto the LORD 3068 glory 3519 and strength. 5797

96:8 Give 3051-3 unto the LORD 3068 the glory 3519 [due unto] his name: 8034 bring 5375-3 an offering, 4503 and come 935-3 into his courts. 2691

96:9 O worship 7812-100 the LORD 3068 in the beauty 1927 of holiness: 6944 fear 2342-3 before 6440 him, all the earth. 776

96:10 Say 559-3 among the heathen 1471 [that] the LORD 3068 reigneth: 4427-1 the world 8398 also shall be established 3559-11 that it shall not be moved: 4131-11 he shall judge 1777-4 the people 5971 righteously. 4339

96:11 Let the heavens 8064 rejoice, 8055-4 and let the earth 776 be glad; 1523-4 let the sea 3220 roar, 7481-4 and the fulness 4393 thereof.

96:12 Let the field 7704 be joyful, 5937-4 and all that [is] therein: then shall all the trees 6086 of the wood 3293 rejoice 7442-17

96:13 Before 6440 the LORD: 3068 for he cometh, 935-1 for he cometh 935-1 to judge 8199-2 the earth: 776 he shall judge 8199-4 the world 8398 with righteousness, 6664 and the people 5971 with his truth. 530

97:1 The LORD 3068 reigneth; 4427-1 let the earth 776 rejoice; 1523-4 let the multitude 7227 of isles 339 be glad 8055-4 [thereof].

97:2 Clouds 6051 and darkness 6205 [are] round about 5439 him: righteousness 6664 and judgment 4941 [are] the habitation 4349 of his throne. 3678

97:3 A fire 784 goeth 3212-4 before 6440 him, and burneth up 3857-17 his enemies 6862 round about. 5439

97:4 His lightnings 1300 enlightened 215-52 the world: 8398 the earth 776 saw, 7200-1 and trembled. 2342-4

97:5 The hills 2022 melted 4549-8 like wax 1749 at the presence 6440 of the LORD, 3068 at the presence 6440 of the Lord 113 of the whole earth. 776

97:6 The heavens 8064 declare 5046-52 his righteousness, 6664 and all the people 5971 see 7200-1 his glory. 3519

97:7 Confounded 954-4 be all they that serve 5647-6 graven images, 6459 that boast 1984-102 themselves of idols: 457 worship 7812-100 him, all [ye] gods. 430

97:8 Zion 6726 heard, 8085-1 and was glad; 8055-4 and the daughters 1323 of Judah 3063 rejoiced 1523-4 because of thy judgments, 4941 O LORD. 3068

97:9 For thou, LORD, 3068 [art] high 5945 above 5921 all the earth: 776 thou art exalted 5927-8 far 3966 above 5921 all gods. 430

97:10 Ye that love 157-6 the LORD, 3068 hate 8130-3 evil: 7451 he preserveth 8104-6 the souls 5315 of his saints; 2623 he delivereth 5337-55 them out of the hand 3027 of the wicked. 7563

97:11 Light 216 is sown 2232-7 for the righteous, 6662 and gladness 8057 for the upright 3477 in heart. 3820

97:12 Rejoice 8055-3 in the LORD, 3068 ye righteous; 6662 and give thanks 3034-54 at the remembrance 2143 of his holiness. 6944

98:1 <A Psalm.> 4210 O sing 7891-3 unto the LORD 3068 a new 2319 song; 7892 for he hath done 6213-1 marvellous things: 6381-12 his right hand, 3225 and his holy 6944 arm, 2220 hath gotten him the victory. 3467-52

98:2 The LORD 3068 hath made known 3045-52 his salvation: 3444 his righteousness 6666 hath he openly shewed 1540-14 in the sight 5869 of the heathen. 1471

98:3 He hath remembered 2142-1 his mercy 2617 and his truth 530 toward the house 1004 of Israel: 3478 all the ends 657 of the earth 776 have seen 7200-1 the salvation 3444 of our God. 430

98:4 Make a joyful noise 7321-54 unto the LORD, 3068 all the earth: 776 make a loud noise, 6476-3 and rejoice, 7442-16 and sing praise. 2167-16

98:5 Sing 2167-16 unto the LORD 3068 with the harp; 3658 with the harp, 3658 and the voice 6963 of a psalm. 2172

98:6 With trumpets 2689 and sound 6963 of cornet 7782 make a joyful noise 7321-54 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 the King. 4428

98:7 Let the sea 3220 roar, 7481-4 and the fulness 4393 thereof; the world, 8398 and they that dwell 3427-6 therein.

98:8 Let the floods 5104 clap 4222-4 [their] hands: 3709 let the hills 2022 be joyful 7442-17 together 3162

98:9 Before 6440 the LORD; 3068 for he cometh 935-1 to judge 8199-2 the earth: 776 with righteousness 6664 shall he judge 8199-4 the world, 8398 and the people 5971 with equity. 4339

99:1 The LORD 3068 reigneth; 4427-1 let the people 5971 tremble: 7264-4 he sitteth 3427-6 [between] the cherubims; 3742 let the earth 776 be moved. 5120-4

99:2 The LORD 3068 [is] great 1419 in Zion; 6726 and he [is] high 7311-1 above all the people. 5971

99:3 Let them praise 3034-55 thy great 1419 and terrible 3372-12 name; 8034 [for] it [is] holy. 6918

99:4 The king's 4428 strength 5797 also loveth 157-1 judgment; 4941 thou dost establish 3559-31 equity, 4339 thou executest 6213-1 judgment 4941 and righteousness 6666 in Jacob. 3290

99:5 Exalt 7311-33 ye the LORD 3068 our God, 430 and worship 7812-100 at his footstool; 7272 1916 [for] he [is] holy. 6918

99:6 Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 among his priests, 3548 and Samuel 8050 among them that call 7121-6 upon his name; 8034 they called 7121-6 upon the LORD, 3068 and he answered 6030-4 them.

99:7 He spake 1696-17 unto them in the cloudy 6051 pillar: 5982 they kept 8104-1 his testimonies, 5713 and the ordinance 2706 [that] he gave 5414-1 them.

99:8 Thou answeredst 6030-1 them, O LORD 3068 our God: 430 thou wast a God 410 that forgavest 5375-6 them, though thou tookest vengeance 5358-6 of their inventions. 5949

99:9 Exalt 7311-33 the LORD 3068 our God, 430 and worship 7812-100 at his holy 6944 hill; 2022 for the LORD 3068 our God 430 [is] holy. 6918

100:1 <A Psalm 4210 of praise.> 8426 Make a joyful noise 7321-54 unto the LORD, 3068 all ye lands. 776

100:2 Serve 5647-3 the LORD 3068 with gladness: 8057 come 935-3 before 6440 his presence with singing. 7445

100:3 Know 3045-3 ye that the LORD 3068 he [is] God: 430 [it is] he [that] hath made 6213-1 us, and not we ourselves; [we are] his people, 5971 and the sheep 6629 of his pasture. 4830

100:4 Enter 935-3 into his gates 8179 with thanksgiving, 8426 [and] into his courts 2691 with praise: 8416 be thankful 3034-54 unto him, [and] bless 1288-16 his name. 8034

100:5 For the LORD 3068 [is] good; 2896 his mercy 2617 [is] everlasting; 5769 and his truth 530 [endureth] to all 1755 generations. 1755

101:1 <A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 I will sing 7891-4 of mercy 2617 and judgment: 4941 unto thee, O LORD, 3068 will I sing. 2167-17

101:2 I will behave myself wisely 7919-55 in a perfect 8549 way. 1870 O when wilt thou come 935-4 unto me? I will walk 1980-101 within 7130 my house 1004 with a perfect 8537 heart. 3824

101:3 I will set 7896-4 no wicked 1100 thing 1697 before mine eyes: 5869 I hate 8130-1 the work 6213-2 of them that turn aside; 7750 [it] shall not cleave 1692-4 to me.

101:4 A froward 6141 heart 3824 shall depart 5493-4 from me: I will not know 3045-4 a wicked 7451 [person].

101:5 Whoso privily 5643 slandereth 3960-18|3960-26-k his neighbour, 7453 him will I cut off: 6789-55 him that hath an high 1362 look 5869 and a proud 7342 heart 3824 will not I suffer. 3201-4

101:6 Mine eyes 5869 [shall be] upon the faithful 539-12 of the land, 776 that they may dwell 3427-2 with me: he that walketh 1980-6 in a perfect 8549 way, 1870 he shall serve 8334-17 me.

101:7 He that worketh 6213-6 deceit 7423 shall not dwell 3427-4 within 7130 my house: 1004 he that telleth 1696-6 lies 8267 shall not tarry 3559-11 in my sight. 5869

101:8 I will early 1242 destroy 6789-55 all the wicked 7563 of the land; 776 that I may cut off 3772-53 all wicked 205 doers 6466-6 from the city 5892 of the LORD. 3068

102:1 <A Prayer 8605 of the afflicted, 6041 when he is overwhelmed, 5848-4 and poureth out 8210-4 his complaint 7879 before 6440 the LORD.> 3068 Hear 8085-3 my prayer, 8605 O LORD, 3068 and let my cry 7775 come 935-4 unto thee.

102:2 Hide 5641-55 not thy face 6440 from me in the day 3117 [when] I am in trouble; 6862 incline 5186-54 thine ear 241 unto me: in the day 3117 [when] I call 7121-4 answer 6030-3 me speedily. 4118

102:3 For my days 3117 are consumed 3615-1 like smoke, 6227 and my bones 6106 are burned 2787-8 as an hearth. 4168

102:4 My heart 3820 is smitten, 5221-90 and withered 3001-4 like grass; 6212 so that I forget 7911-1 to eat 398-2 my bread. 3899

102:5 By reason of the voice 6963 of my groaning 585 my bones 6106 cleave 1692-1 to my skin. 1320

102:6 I am like 1819-1 a pelican 6893 of the wilderness: 4057 I am like an owl 3563 of the desert. 2723

102:7 I watch, 8245-1 and am as a sparrow 6833 alone 909-6 upon the house top. 1406

102:8 Mine enemies 341-6 reproach 2778-14 me all the day; 3117 [and] they that are mad 1984-26 against me are sworn 7650-8 against me.

102:9 For I have eaten 398-1 ashes 665 like bread, 3899 and mingled 4537-1 my drink 8249 with weeping, 1065

102:10 Because 6440 of thine indignation 2195 and thy wrath: 7110 for thou hast lifted me up, 5375-1 and cast me down. 7993-55

102:11 My days 3117 [are] like a shadow 6738 that declineth; 5186-7 and I am withered 3001-4 like grass. 6212

102:12 But thou, O LORD, 3068 shalt endure 3427-4 for ever; 5769 and thy remembrance 2143 unto all 1755 generations. 1755

102:13 Thou shalt arise, 6965-4 [and] have mercy 7355-17 upon Zion: 6726 for the time 6256 to favour 2603-2 her, yea, the set time, 4150 is come. 935-1

102:14 For thy servants 5650 take pleasure 7521-1 in her stones, 68 and favour 2603-25 the dust 6083 thereof.

102:15 So the heathen 1471 shall fear 3372-4 the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 and all the kings 4428 of the earth 776 thy glory. 3519

102:16 When the LORD 3068 shall build up 1129-1 Zion, 6726 he shall appear 7200-8 in his glory. 3519

102:17 He will regard 6437-1 the prayer 8605 of the destitute, 6199 and not despise 959-1 their prayer. 8605

102:18 This shall be written 3789-11 for the generation 1755 to come: 314 and the people 5971 which shall be created 1254-12 shall praise 1984-17 the LORD. 3050

102:19 For he hath looked down 8259-52 from the height 4791 of his sanctuary; 6944 from heaven 8064 did the LORD 3068 behold 5027-52 the earth; 776

102:20 To hear 8085-2 the groaning 603 of the prisoner; 615 to loose 6605-15 those that are appointed 1121 to death; 8546

102:21 To declare 5608-15 the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 in Zion, 6726 and his praise 8416 in Jerusalem; 3389

102:22 When the people 5971 are gathered 6908-9 together, 3162 and the kingdoms, 4467 to serve 5647-2 the LORD. 3068

102:23 He weakened 6031-14 my strength 3581 in the way; 1870 he shortened 7114-14 my days. 3117

102:24 I said, 559-4 O my God, 410 take me not away 5927-55 in the midst 2677 of my days: 3117 thy years 8141 [are] throughout all 1755 generations. 1755

102:25 Of old 6440 hast thou laid the foundation 3245-1 of the earth: 776 and the heavens 8064 [are] the work 4639 of thy hands. 3027

102:26 They shall perish, 6-4 but thou shalt endure: 5975-4 yea, all of them shall wax old 1086-4 like a garment; 899 as a vesture 3830 shalt thou change 2498-55 them, and they shall be changed: 2498-4

102:27 But thou [art] the same, and thy years 8141 shall have no end. 8552-11

102:28 The children 1121 of thy servants 5650 shall continue, 7931-4 and their seed 2233 shall be established 3559-11 before 6440 thee.

103:1 <[A Psalm] of David.> 1732 Bless 1288-16 the LORD, 3068 O my soul: 5315 and all that is within 7130 me, [bless] his holy 6944 name. 8034

103:2 Bless 1288-16 the LORD, 3068 O my soul, 5315 and forget 7911-4 not all his benefits: 1576

103:3 Who forgiveth 5545-6 all thine iniquities; 5771 who healeth 7495-6 all thy diseases; 8463

103:4 Who redeemeth 1350-6 thy life 2416 from destruction; 7845 who crowneth 5849-18 thee with lovingkindness 2617 and tender mercies; 7356

103:5 Who satisfieth 7646-56 thy mouth 5716 with good 2896 [things; so that] thy youth 5271 is renewed 2318-101 like the eagle's. 5404

103:6 The LORD 3068 executeth 6213-6 righteousness 6666 and judgment 4941 for all that are oppressed. 6231-7

103:7 He made known 3045-55 his ways 1870 unto Moses, 4872 his acts 5949 unto the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

103:8 The LORD 3068 [is] merciful 7349 and gracious, 2587 slow 750 to anger, 639 and plenteous 7227 in mercy. 2617

103:9 He will not always 5331 chide: 7378-4 neither will he keep 5201-4 [his anger] for ever. 5769

103:10 He hath not dealt 6213-1 with us after our sins; 2399 nor rewarded 1580-1 us according to our iniquities. 5771

103:11 For as the heaven 8064 is high 1361-2 above the earth, 776 [so] great 1396-1 is his mercy 2617 toward them that fear 3373 him.

103:12 As far as 7368-2 the east 4217 is from the west, 4628 [so] far hath he removed 7368-52 our transgressions 6588 from us.

103:13 Like as a father 1 pitieth 7355-15 [his] children, 1121 [so] the LORD 3068 pitieth 7355-14 them that fear 3373 him.

103:14 For he knoweth 3045-1 our frame; 3336 he remembereth 2142-7 that we [are] dust. 6083

103:15 [As for] man, 582 his days 3117 [are] as grass: 2682 as a flower 6731 of the field, 7704 so he flourisheth. 6692-55

103:16 For the wind 7307 passeth 5674-1 over it, and it is gone; and the place 4725 thereof shall know 5234-55 it no more.

103:17 But the mercy 2617 of the LORD 3068 [is] from everlasting 5769 to 5704 everlasting 5769 upon them that fear 3373 him, and his righteousness 6666 unto children's 1121 children; 1121

103:18 To such as keep 8104-6 his covenant, 1285 and to those that remember 2142-6 his commandments 6490 to do 6213-2 them.

103:19 The LORD 3068 hath prepared 3559-52 his throne 3678 in the heavens; 8064 and his kingdom 4438 ruleth 4910-1 over all.

103:20 Bless 1288-16 the LORD, 3068 ye his angels, 4397 that excel 1368 in strength, 3581 that do 6213-6 his commandments, 1697 hearkening 8085-2 unto the voice 6963 of his word. 1697

103:21 Bless 1288-16 ye the LORD, 3068 all [ye] his hosts; 6635 [ye] ministers 8334-18 of his, that do 6213-6 his pleasure. 7522

103:22 Bless 1288-16 the LORD, 3068 all his works 4639 in all places 4725 of his dominion: 4475 bless 1288-16 the LORD, 3068 O my soul. 5315

104:1 Bless 1288-16 the LORD, 3068 O my soul. 5315 O LORD 3068 my God, 430 thou art very 3966 great; 1431-1 thou art clothed 3847-1 with honour 1935 and majesty. 1926

104:2 Who coverest 5844-6 [thyself] with light 216 as [with] a garment: 8008 who stretchest out 5186-6 the heavens 8064 like a curtain: 3407

104:3 Who layeth the beams 7136-18 of his chambers 5944 in the waters: 4325 who maketh 7760-6 the clouds 5645 his chariot: 7398 who walketh 1980-18 upon the wings 3671 of the wind: 7307

104:4 Who maketh 6213-6 his angels 4397 spirits; 7307 his ministers 8334-18 a flaming 3857-6 fire: 784

104:5 [Who] laid 3245-1 the foundations 4349 of the earth, 776 [that] it should not be removed 4131-11 for ever. 5769 5703

104:6 Thou coveredst 3680-14 it with the deep 8415 as [with] a garment: 3830 the waters 4325 stood 5975-4 above the mountains. 2022

104:7 At 4480 thy rebuke 1606 they fled; 5127-4 at 4480 the voice 6963 of thy thunder 7482 they hasted away. 2648-11

104:8 They go up 5927-4 by the mountains; 2022 they go down 3381-4 by the valleys 1237 unto the place 4725 which 2088 thou hast founded 3245-1 for them.

104:9 Thou hast set 7760-1 a bound 1366 that they may not pass over; 5674-4 that they turn not again 7725-4 to cover 3680-15 the earth. 776

104:10 He sendeth 7971-18 the springs 4599 into the valleys, 5158 [which] run 1980-17 among the hills. 2022

104:11 They give drink 8248-55 to every beast 2416 of the field: 7704 the wild asses 6501 quench 7665-4 their thirst. 6772

104:12 By them shall the fowls 5775 of the heaven 8064 have their habitation, 7931-4 [which] sing 5414-4 6963 among 996 the branches. 6073

104:13 He watereth 8248-56 the hills 2022 from his chambers: 5944 the earth 776 is satisfied 7646-4 with the fruit 6529 of thy works. 4639

104:14 He causeth the grass 2682 to grow 6779-56 for the cattle, 929 and herb 6212 for the service 5656 of man: 120 that he may bring forth 3318-53 food 3899 out of the earth; 776

104:15 And wine 3196 [that] maketh glad 8055-17 the heart 3824 of man, 582 [and] oil 8081 to make [his] face 6440 to shine, 6670-53 and bread 3899 [which] strengtheneth 5582-4 man's 582 heart. 3824

104:16 The trees 6086 of the LORD 3068 are full 7646-4 [of sap]; the cedars 730 of Lebanon, 3844 which he hath planted; 5193-1

104:17 Where the birds 6833 make their nests: 7077-17 [as for] the stork, 2624 the fir trees 1265 [are] her house. 1004

104:18 The high 1364 hills 2022 [are] a refuge 4268 for the wild goats; 3277 [and] the rocks 5553 for the conies. 8227

104:19 He appointed 6213-1 the moon 3394 for seasons: 4150 the sun 8121 knoweth 3045-1 his going down. 3996

104:20 Thou makest 7896-4 darkness, 2822 and it is night: 3915 wherein all the beasts 2416 of the forest 3293 do creep 7430-4 [forth].

104:21 The young lions 3715 roar 7580-6 after their prey, 2964 and seek 1245-15 their meat 400 from God. 410

104:22 The sun 8121 ariseth, 2224-4 they gather 622-11 themselves together, and lay them down 7257-4 in their dens. 4585

104:23 Man 120 goeth forth 3318-4 unto his work 6467 and to his labour 5656 until the evening. 6153

104:24 O LORD, 3068 how manifold 7231-1 are thy works! 4639 in wisdom 2451 hast thou made 6213-1 them all: the earth 776 is full 4390-1 of thy riches. 7075

104:25 [So is] this great 1419 and wide 7342 3027 sea, 3220 wherein [are] things creeping 7431 innumerable, 369 4557 both small 6996 and great 1419 beasts. 2416

104:26 There go 1980-17 the ships: 591 [there is] that leviathan, 3882 [whom] thou hast made 3335-1 to play 7832-15 therein.

104:27 These wait 7663-17 all upon thee; that thou mayest give 5414-2 [them] their meat 400 in due season. 6256

104:28 [That] thou givest 5414-4 them they gather: 3950-4 thou openest 6605-4 thine hand, 3027 they are filled 7646-4 with good. 2896

104:29 Thou hidest 5641-55 thy face, 6440 they are troubled: 926-11 thou takest away 622-4 their breath, 7307 they die, 1478-4 and return 7725-4 to their dust. 6083

104:30 Thou sendest 7971-17 forth thy spirit, 7307 they are created: 1254-11 and thou renewest 2318-17 the face 6440 of the earth. 127

104:31 The glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 shall endure for ever: 5769 the LORD 3068 shall rejoice 8055-4 in his works. 4639

104:32 He looketh 5027-56 on the earth, 776 and it trembleth: 7460-4 he toucheth 5060-4 the hills, 2022 and they smoke. 6225-4

104:33 I will sing 7891-4 unto the LORD 3068 as long as I live: 2416 I will sing praise 2167-17 to my God 430 while I have my being. 5750

104:34 My meditation 7879 of him shall be sweet: 6149-4 I will be glad 8055-4 in the LORD. 3068

104:35 Let the sinners 2400 be consumed 8552-11 out of the earth, 776 and let the wicked 7563 be no more. Bless 1288-16 thou the LORD, 3068 O my soul. 5315 Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD. 3050

105:1 O give thanks 3034-54 unto the LORD; 3068 call 7121-3 upon his name: 8034 make known 3045-54 his deeds 5949 among the people. 5971

105:2 Sing 7891-3 unto him, sing psalms 2167-16 unto him: talk 7878-3 ye of all his wondrous works. 6381-12

105:3 Glory 1984-100 ye in his holy 6944 name: 8034 let the heart 3820 of them rejoice 8055-4 that seek 1245-18 the LORD. 3068

105:4 Seek 1875-3 the LORD, 3068 and his strength: 5797 seek 1245-16 his face 6440 evermore. 8548

105:5 Remember 2142-3 his marvellous works 6381-12 that he hath done; 6213-1 his wonders, 4159 and the judgments 4941 of his mouth; 6310

105:6 O ye seed 2233 of Abraham 85 his servant, 5650 ye children 1121 of Jacob 3290 his chosen. 972

105:7 He [is] the LORD 3068 our God: 430 his judgments 4941 [are] in all the earth. 776

105:8 He hath remembered 2142-1 his covenant 1285 for ever, 5769 the word 1697 [which] he commanded 6680-14 to a thousand 505 generations. 1755

105:9 Which [covenant] he made 3772-1 with Abraham, 85 and his oath 7621 unto Isaac; 3446

105:10 And confirmed 5975-55 the same unto Jacob 3290 for a law, 2706 [and] to Israel 3478 [for] an everlasting 5769 covenant: 1285

105:11 Saying, 559-2 Unto thee will I give 5414-4 the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 the lot 2256 of your inheritance: 5159

105:12 When they were [but] a few men 4962 in number; 4557 yea, very few, 4592 and strangers 1481-6 in it.

105:13 When they went 1980-101 from one nation 1471 to another, 1471 from [one] kingdom 4467 to another 312 people; 5971

105:14 He suffered 3240-52 no man 120 to do them wrong: 6231-2 yea, he reproved 3198-55 kings 4428 for their sakes;

105:15 [Saying], Touch 5060-4 not mine anointed, 4899 and do my prophets 5030 no harm. 7489-55

105:16 Moreover he called 7121-4 for a famine 7458 upon the land: 776 he brake 7665-1 the whole staff 4294 of bread. 3899

105:17 He sent 7971-1 a man 376 before 6440 them, [even] Joseph, 3130 [who] was sold 4376-8 for a servant: 5650

105:18 Whose feet 7272 they hurt 6031-14 with fetters: 3525 he 5315 was laid 935-1 in iron: 1270

105:19 Until the time 6256 that his word 1697 came: 935-2 the word 565 of the LORD 3068 tried 6884-1 him.

105:20 The king 4428 sent 7971-1 and loosed 5425-55 him; [even] the ruler 4910-6 of the people, 5971 and let him go free. 6605-17

105:21 He made 7760-1 him lord 113 of his house, 1004 and ruler 4910-6 of all his substance: 7075

105:22 To bind 631-2 his princes 8269 at his pleasure; 5315 and teach his senators 2205 wisdom. 2449-17

105:23 Israel 3478 also came 935-4 into Egypt; 4714 and Jacob 3290 sojourned 1481-1 in the land 776 of Ham. 2526

105:24 And he increased 6509-55 his people 5971 greatly; 3966 and made them stronger 6105-55 than their enemies. 6862

105:25 He turned 2015-1 their heart 3820 to hate 8130-2 his people, 5971 to deal subtilly 5230-99 with his servants. 5650

105:26 He sent 7971-1 Moses 4872 his servant; 5650 [and] Aaron 175 whom he had chosen. 977-1

105:27 They shewed 7760-1 his signs 226 1697 among them, and wonders 4159 in the land 776 of Ham. 2526

105:28 He sent 7971-1 darkness, 2822 and made it dark; 2821-55 and they rebelled 4784-1 not against his word. 1697

105:29 He turned 2015-1 their waters 4325 into blood, 1818 and slew 4191-55 their fish. 1710

105:30 Their land 776 brought forth frogs 6854 in abundance, 8317-1 in the chambers 2315 of their kings. 4428

105:31 He spake, 559-1 and there came 935-4 divers sorts of flies, 6157 [and] lice 3654 in all their coasts. 1366

105:32 He gave 5414-1 them hail 1259 for rain, 1653 [and] flaming 3852 fire 784 in their land. 776

105:33 He smote 5221-55 their vines 1612 also and their fig trees; 8384 and brake 7665-17 the trees 6086 of their coasts. 1366

105:34 He spake, 559-1 and the locusts 697 came, 935-4 and caterpillers, 3218 and that without number, 4557

105:35 And did eat 398-4 up all the herbs 6212 in their land, 776 and devoured 398-4 the fruit 6529 of their ground. 127

105:36 He smote 5221-55 also all the firstborn 1060 in their land, 776 the chief 7225 of all their strength. 202

105:37 He brought them forth 3318-55 also with silver 3701 and gold: 2091 and [there was] not one feeble 3782-6 [person] among their tribes. 7626

105:38 Egypt 4714 was glad 8055-1 when they departed: 3318-2 for the fear 6343 of them fell 5307-1 upon them.

105:39 He spread 6566-1 a cloud 6051 for a covering; 4539 and fire 784 to give light 215-53 in the night. 3915

105:40 [The people] asked, 7592-1 and he brought 935-55 quails, 7958 and satisfied 7646-55 them with the bread 3899 of heaven. 8064

105:41 He opened 6605-1 the rock, 6697 and the waters 4325 gushed out; 2100-4 they ran 1980-1 in the dry places 6723 [like] a river. 5104

105:42 For he remembered 2142-1 his holy 6944 promise, 1697 [and] Abraham 85 his servant. 5650

105:43 And he brought forth 3318-55 his people 5971 with joy, 8342 [and] his chosen 972 with gladness: 7440

105:44 And gave 5414-4 them the lands 776 of the heathen: 1471 and they inherited 3423-4 the labour 5999 of the people; 3816

105:45 That they might observe 8104-4 his statutes, 2706 and keep 5341-4 his laws. 8451 Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD. 3050

106:1 Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD. 3050 O give thanks 3034-54 unto the LORD; 3068 for [he is] good: 2896 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

106:2 Who can utter 4448-17 the mighty acts 1369 of the LORD? 3068 [who] can shew forth 8085-55 all his praise? 8416

106:3 Blessed 835 [are] they that keep 8104-6 judgment, 4941 [and] he that doeth 6213-6 righteousness 6666 at all times. 6256

106:4 Remember 2142-3 me, O LORD, 3068 with the favour 7522 [that thou bearest unto] thy people: 5971 O visit 6485-3 me with thy salvation; 3444

106:5 That I may see 7200-2 the good 2896 of thy chosen, 972 that I may rejoice 8055-2 in the gladness 8057 of thy nation, 1471 that I may glory 1984-99 with thine inheritance. 5159

106:6 We have sinned 2398-1 with our fathers, 1 we have committed iniquity, 5753-52 we have done wickedly. 7561-52

106:7 Our fathers 1 understood 7919-52 not thy wonders 6381-12 in Egypt; 4714 they remembered 2142-1 not the multitude 7230 of thy mercies; 2617 but provoked 4784-55 [him] at the sea, 3220 [even] at the Red 5488 sea. 3220

106:8 Nevertheless he saved 3467-55 them for his name's 8034 sake, that he might make his mighty power 1369 to be known. 3045-53

106:9 He rebuked 1605-4 the Red 5488 sea 3220 also, and it was dried up: 2717-4 so he led 3212-55 them through the depths, 8415 as through the wilderness. 4057

106:10 And he saved 3467-55 them from the hand 3027 of him that hated 8130-6 [them], and redeemed 1350-4 them from the hand 3027 of the enemy. 341-6

106:11 And the waters 4325 covered 3680-17 their enemies: 6862 there was not one 259 of them left. 3498-8

106:12 Then believed 539-55 they his words; 1697 they sang 7891-4 his praise. 8416

106:13 They soon 4116-14 forgat 7911-1 his works; 4639 they waited 2442-14 not for his counsel: 6098

106:14 But lusted 183-101 exceedingly 8378 in the wilderness, 4057 and tempted 5254-17 God 410 in the desert. 3452

106:15 And he gave 5414-4 them their request; 7596 but sent 7971-17 leanness 7332 into their soul. 5315

106:16 They envied 7065-17 Moses 4872 also in the camp, 4264 [and] Aaron 175 the saint 6918 of the LORD. 3068

106:17 The earth 776 opened 6605-4 and swallowed up 1104-4 Dathan, 1885 and covered 3680-17 the company 5712 of Abiram. 48

106:18 And a fire 784 was kindled 1197-4 in their company; 5712 the flame 3852 burned up 3857-17 the wicked. 7563

106:19 They made 6213-4 a calf 5695 in Horeb, 2722 and worshipped 7812-101 the molten image. 4541

106:20 Thus they changed 4171-55 their glory 3519 into the similitude 8403 of an ox 7794 that eateth 398-6 grass. 6212

106:21 They forgat 7911-1 God 410 their saviour, 3467-56 which had done 6213-6 great things 1419 in Egypt; 4714

106:22 Wondrous works 6381-12 in the land 776 of Ham, 2526 [and] terrible things 3372-12 by the Red 5488 sea. 3220

106:23 Therefore he said 559-4 that he would destroy 8045-53 them, had not 3884 Moses 4872 his chosen 972 stood 5975-1 before 6440 him in the breach, 6556 to turn away 7725-53 his wrath, 2534 lest he should destroy 7843-53 [them].

106:24 Yea, they despised 3988-4 the pleasant 2532 land, 776 they believed 539-52 not his word: 1697

106:25 But murmured 7279-11 in their tents, 168 [and] hearkened 8085-1 not unto the voice 6963 of the LORD. 3068

106:26 Therefore he lifted up 5375-4 his hand 3027 against them, to overthrow 5307-53 them in the wilderness: 4057

106:27 To overthrow 5307-53 their seed 2233 also among the nations, 1471 and to scatter 2219-15 them in the lands. 776

106:28 They joined 6775-11 themselves also unto Baalpeor, 1187 and ate 398-4 the sacrifices 2077 of the dead. 4191-5

106:29 Thus they provoked [him] to anger 3707-55 with their inventions: 4611 and the plague 4046 brake in 6555-4 upon them.

106:30 Then stood up 5975-4 Phinehas, 6372 and executed judgment: 6419-17 and [so] the plague 4046 was stayed. 6113-11

106:31 And that was counted 2803-11 unto him for righteousness 6666 unto all 1755 generations 1755 for 5704 evermore. 5769

106:32 They angered 7107-55 [him] also at the waters 4325 of strife, 4808|1779 so that it went ill 3415-4 with Moses 4872 for their sakes:

106:33 Because they provoked 4784-52 his spirit, 7307 so that he spake unadvisedly 981-17 with his lips. 8193

106:34 They did not destroy 8045-52 the nations, 5971 concerning whom the LORD 3068 commanded 559-1 them:

106:35 But were mingled 6148-101 among the heathen, 1471 and learned 3925-4 their works. 4639

106:36 And they served 5647-4 their idols: 6091 which were a snare 4170 unto them.

106:37 Yea, they sacrificed 2076-4 their sons 1121 and their daughters 1323 unto devils, 7700

106:38 And shed 8210-4 innocent 5355 blood, 1818 [even] the blood 1818 of their sons 1121 and of their daughters, 1323 whom they sacrificed 2076-14 unto the idols 6091 of Canaan: 3667 and the land 776 was polluted 2610-4 with blood. 1818

106:39 Thus were they defiled 2930-4 with their own works, 4639 and went a whoring 2181-4 with their own inventions. 4611

106:40 Therefore was the wrath 639 of the LORD 3068 kindled 2734-4 against his people, 5971 insomuch that he abhorred 8581-17 his own inheritance. 5159

106:41 And he gave 5414-4 them into the hand 3027 of the heathen; 1471 and they that hated 8130-6 them ruled 4910-4 over them.

106:42 Their enemies 341-6 also oppressed 3905-4 them, and they were brought into subjection 3665-11 under their hand. 3027

106:43 Many 7227 times 6471 did he deliver 5337-55 them; but they provoked 4784-55 [him] with their counsel, 6098 and were brought low 4355-4 for their iniquity. 5771

106:44 Nevertheless he regarded 7200-4 their affliction, 6862 when he heard 8085-2 their cry: 7440

106:45 And he remembered 2142-4 for them his covenant, 1285 and repented 5162-11 according to the multitude 7230 of his mercies. 2617

106:46 He made 5414-4 them also to be pitied 7356 of 6440 all those that carried them captives. 7617-6

106:47 Save 3467-54 us, O LORD 3068 our God, 430 and gather 6908-16 us from among the heathen, 1471 to give thanks 3034-53 unto thy holy 6944 name, 8034 [and] to triumph 7623-99 in thy praise. 8416

106:48 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 from everlasting 5769 to everlasting: 5769 and let all the people 5971 say, 559-1 Amen. 543 Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD. 3050

107:1 O give thanks 3034-54 unto the LORD, 3068 for [he is] good: 2896 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

107:2 Let the redeemed 1350-7 of the LORD 3068 say 559-4 [so], whom he hath redeemed 1350-1 from the hand 3027 of the enemy; 6862

107:3 And gathered 6908-14 them out of the lands, 776 from the east, 4217 and from the west, 4628 from the north, 6828 and from the south. 3220

107:4 They wandered 8582-1 in the wilderness 4057 in a solitary 3452 way; 1870 they found 4672-1 no city 5892 to dwell 4186 in.

107:5 Hungry 7457 and thirsty, 6771 their soul 5315 fainted 5848-101 in them.

107:6 Then they cried 6817-4 unto the LORD 3068 in their trouble, 6862 [and] he delivered 5337-55 them out of their distresses. 4691

107:7 And he led them forth 1869-55 by the right 3477 way, 1870 that they might go 3212-2 to a city 5892 of habitation. 4186

107:8 Oh that [men] would praise 3034-55 the LORD 3068 [for] his goodness, 2617 and [for] his wonderful works 6381-12 to the children 1121 of men! 120

107:9 For he satisfieth 7646-52 the longing 8264-6 soul, 5315 and filleth 4390-14 the hungry 7457 soul 5315 with goodness. 2896

107:10 Such as sit in 3427-6 darkness 2822 and in the shadow of death, 6757 [being] bound 615 in affliction 6040 and iron; 1270

107:11 Because they rebelled 4784-52 against the words 561 of God, 410 and contemned 5006-1 the counsel 6098 of the most High: 5945

107:12 Therefore he brought down 3665-55 their heart 3820 with labour; 5999 they fell down, 3782-1 and [there was] none to help. 5826-6

107:13 Then they cried 2199-4 unto the LORD 3068 in their trouble, 6862 [and] he saved 3467-55 them out of their distresses. 4691

107:14 He brought them out 3318-55 of darkness 2822 and the shadow of death, 6757 and brake 5423-17 their bands 4147 in sunder.

107:15 Oh that [men] would praise 3034-55 the LORD 3068 [for] his goodness, 2617 and [for] his wonderful works 6381-12 to the children 1121 of men! 120

107:16 For he hath broken 7665-14 the gates 1817 of brass, 5178 and cut the bars 1280 of iron 1270 in sunder. 1438-14

107:17 Fools 191 because 1870 of their transgression, 6588 and because of their iniquities, 5771 are afflicted. 6031-101

107:18 Their soul 5315 abhorreth 8581-17 all manner of meat; 400 and they draw near 5060-55 unto the gates 8179 of death. 4194

107:19 Then they cry 2199-4 unto the LORD 3068 in their trouble, 6862 [and] he saveth 3467-55 them out of their distresses. 4691

107:20 He sent 7971-4 his word, 1697 and healed 7495-4 them, and delivered 4422-17 [them] from their destructions. 7825

107:21 Oh that [men] would praise 3034-55 the LORD 3068 [for] his goodness, 2617 and [for] his wonderful works 6381-12 to the children 1121 of men! 120

107:22 And let them sacrifice 2076-4 the sacrifices 2077 of thanksgiving, 8426 and declare 5608-17 his works 4639 with rejoicing. 7440

107:23 They that go down 3381-6 to the sea 3220 in ships, 591 that do 6213-6 business 4399 in great 7227 waters; 4325

107:24 These see 7200-1 the works 4639 of the LORD, 3068 and his wonders 6381-12 in the deep. 4688

107:25 For he commandeth, 559-4 and raiseth 5975-55 the stormy 5591 wind, 7307 which lifteth up 7311-34 the waves 1530 thereof.

107:26 They mount up 5927-4 to the heaven, 8064 they go down 3381-4 again to the depths: 8415 their soul 5315 is melted 4127-113 because of trouble. 7451

107:27 They reel to and fro, 2287-4 and stagger 5128-4 like a drunken 7910 man, and are at their wits' 2451 end. 1104-101

107:28 Then they cry 6817-4 unto the LORD 3068 in their trouble, 6862 and he bringeth them out 3318-55 of their distresses. 4691

107:29 He maketh 6965-55 the storm 5591 a calm, 1827 so that the waves 1530 thereof are still. 2814-4

107:30 Then are they glad 8055-4 because they be quiet; 8367-4 so he bringeth 5148-55 them unto their desired 2656 haven. 4231

107:31 Oh that [men] would praise 3034-55 the LORD 3068 [for] his goodness, 2617 and [for] his wonderful works 6381-12 to the children 1121 of men! 120

107:32 Let them exalt 7311-34 him also in the congregation 6951 of the people, 5971 and praise 1984-17 him in the assembly 4186 of the elders. 2205

107:33 He turneth 7760-4 rivers 5104 into a wilderness, 4057 and the watersprings 4325 4161 into dry ground; 6774

107:34 A fruitful 6529 land 776 into barrenness, 4420 for the wickedness 7451 of them that dwell 3427-6 therein.

107:35 He turneth 7760-4 the wilderness 4057 into a standing 98 water, 4325 and dry 6723 ground 776 into watersprings. 4325 4161

107:36 And there he maketh the hungry 7457 to dwell, 3427-55 that they may prepare 3559-34 a city 5892 for habitation; 4186

107:37 And sow 2232-4 the fields, 7704 and plant 5193-4 vineyards, 3754 which may yield 6213-4 fruits 6529 of increase. 8393

107:38 He blesseth 1288-17 them also, so that they are multiplied 7235-4 greatly; 3966 and suffereth not their cattle 929 to decrease. 4591-55

107:39 Again, they are minished 4591-4 and brought low 7817-4 through oppression, 6115 affliction, 7451 and sorrow. 3015

107:40 He poureth 8210-6 contempt 937 upon princes, 5081 and causeth them to wander 8582-55 in the wilderness, 8414 [where there is] no way. 1870

107:41 Yet setteth he the poor 34 on high 7682-17 from affliction, 6040 and maketh 7760-4 [him] families 4940 like a flock. 6629

107:42 The righteous 3477 shall see 7200-4 [it], and rejoice: 8055-4 and all iniquity 5766 shall stop 7092-1 her mouth. 6310

107:43 Whoso [is] wise, 2450 and will observe 8104-4 these [things], even they shall understand 995-113 the lovingkindness 2617 of the LORD. 3068

108:1 <A Song 7892 [or] Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 O God, 430 my heart 3820 is fixed; 3559-12 I will sing 7891-4 and give praise, 2167-17 even with my glory. 3519

108:2 Awake, 5782-3 psaltery 5035 and harp: 3658 I [myself] will awake 5782-55 early. 7837

108:3 I will praise 3034-55 thee, O LORD, 3068 among the people: 5971 and I will sing praises 2167-17 unto thee among the nations. 3816

108:4 For thy mercy 2617 [is] great 1419 above the heavens: 8064 and thy truth 571 [reacheth] unto the clouds. 7834

108:5 Be thou exalted, 7311-3 O God, 430 above the heavens: 8064 and thy glory 3519 above all the earth; 776

108:6 That thy beloved 3039 may be delivered: 2502-11 save 3467-54 [with] thy right hand, 3225 and answer 6030-3 me.

108:7 God 430 hath spoken 1696-14 in his holiness; 6944 I will rejoice, 5937-4 I will divide 2505-17 Shechem, 7927 and mete out 4058-17 the valley 6010 of Succoth. 5523

108:8 Gilead 1568 [is] mine; Manasseh 4519 [is] mine; Ephraim 669 also [is] the strength 4581 of mine head; 7218 Judah 3063 [is] my lawgiver; 2710-26

108:9 Moab 4124 [is] my washpot; 7366 5518 over Edom 123 will I cast out 7993-55 my shoe; 5275 over Philistia 6429 will I triumph. 7321-113

108:10 Who will bring 2986-55 me into the strong 4013 city? 5892 who will lead 5148-1 me into Edom? 123

108:11 [Wilt] not [thou], O God, 430 [who] hast cast us off? 2186-1 and wilt not thou, O God, 430 go forth 3318-4 with our hosts? 6635

108:12 Give 3051-3 us help 5833 from trouble: 6862 for vain 7723 [is] the help 8668 of man. 120

108:13 Through God 430 we shall do 6213-4 valiantly: 2428 for he [it is that] shall tread down 947-4 our enemies. 6862

109:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 Hold not thy peace, 2790-4 O God 430 of my praise; 8416

109:2 For the mouth 6310 of the wicked 7563 and the mouth 6310 of the deceitful 4820 are opened 6605-1 against me: they have spoken 1696-14 against me with a lying 8267 tongue. 3956

109:3 They compassed me about 5437-1 also with words 1697 of hatred; 8135 and fought 3898-11 against me without a cause. 2600

109:4 For my love 160 they are my adversaries: 7853-4 but I [give myself unto] prayer. 8605

109:5 And they have rewarded 7760-4 me evil 7451 for good, 2896 and hatred 8135 for my love. 160

109:6 Set 6485-54 thou a wicked 7563 man over him: and let Satan 7854 stand 5975-4 at his right hand. 3225

109:7 When he shall be judged, 8199-9 let him be 3318-4 condemned: 7563 and let his prayer 8605 become sin. 2401

109:8 Let his days 3117 be few; 4592 [and] let another 312 take 3947-4 his office. 6486

109:9 Let his children 1121 be fatherless, 3490 and his wife 802 a widow. 490

109:10 Let his children 1121 be continually 5128-2 vagabonds, 5128-4 and beg: 7592-14 let them seek 1875-1 [their bread] also out of their desolate places. 2723

109:11 Let the extortioner 5383-6 catch 5367-17 all that he hath; and let the strangers 2114-5 spoil 962-4 his labour. 3018

109:12 Let there be none to extend 4900-6 mercy 2617 unto him: neither let there be any to favour 2603-6 his fatherless children. 3490

109:13 Let his posterity 319 be cut off; 3772-53 [and] in the generation 1755 following 312 let their name 8034 be blotted out. 4229-11

109:14 Let the iniquity 5771 of his fathers 1 be remembered 2142-11 with the LORD; 3068 and let not the sin 2403 of his mother 517 be blotted out. 4229-11

109:15 Let them be before the LORD 3068 continually, 8548 that he may cut off 3772-55 the memory 2143 of them from the earth. 776

109:16 Because that he remembered 2142-1 not to shew 6213-2 mercy, 2617 but persecuted 7291-4 the poor 6041 and needy 34 man, 376 that he might even slay 4191-32 the broken 3512-12 in heart. 3824

109:17 As he loved 157-4 cursing, 7045 so let it come 935-4 unto him: as he delighted 2654-1 not in blessing, 1293 so let it be far 7368-4 from him.

109:18 As he clothed 3847-4 himself with cursing 7045 like as with his garment, 4055 so let it come 935-4 into his bowels 7130 like water, 4325 and like oil 8081 into his bones. 6106

109:19 Let it be unto him as the garment 899 [which] covereth 5844-4 him, and for a girdle 4206 wherewith he is girded 2296-4 continually. 8548

109:20 [Let] this [be] the reward 6468 of mine adversaries 7853-6 from the LORD, 3068 and of them that speak 1696-6 evil 7451 against my soul. 5315

109:21 But do 6213-3 thou for me, O GOD 3069 the Lord, 136 for thy name's 8034 sake: because thy mercy 2617 [is] good, 2896 deliver 5337-54 thou me.

109:22 For I [am] poor 6041 and needy, 34 and my heart 3820 is wounded 2490-1 within 7130 me.

109:23 I am gone 1980-8 like the shadow 6738 when it declineth: 5186-2 I am tossed up and down 5287-8 as the locust. 697

109:24 My knees 1290 are weak 3782-1 through fasting; 6685 and my flesh 1320 faileth 3584-1 of fatness. 8081

109:25 I became also a reproach 2781 unto them: [when] they looked 7200-4 upon me they shaked 5128-55 their heads. 7218

109:26 Help 5826-3 me, O LORD 3068 my God: 430 O save 3467-54 me according to thy mercy: 2617

109:27 That they may know 3045-4 that this [is] thy hand; 3027 [that] thou, LORD, 3068 hast done 6213-1 it.

109:28 Let them curse, 7043-17 but bless 1288-17 thou: when they arise, 6965-1 let them be ashamed; 954-4 but let thy servant 5650 rejoice. 8055-4

109:29 Let mine adversaries 7853-6 be clothed 3847-4 with shame, 3639 and let them cover 5844-4 themselves with their own confusion, 1322 as with a mantle. 4598

109:30 I will greatly 3966 praise 3034-55 the LORD 3068 with my mouth; 6310 yea, I will praise 1984-17 him among 8432 the multitude. 7227

109:31 For he shall stand 5975-4 at the right hand 3225 of the poor, 34 to save 3467-53 [him] from those that condemn 8199-6 his soul. 5315

110:1 <A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 The LORD 3068 said 5002-7 unto my Lord, 113 Sit 3427-3 thou at my right hand, 3225 until I make 7896-4 thine enemies 341-6 thy footstool. 1916 7272

110:2 The LORD 3068 shall send 7971-4 the rod 4294 of thy strength 5797 out of Zion: 6726 rule 7287-3 thou in the midst 7130 of thine enemies. 341-6

110:3 Thy people 5971 [shall be] willing 5071 in the day 3117 of thy power, 2428 in the beauties 1926 of holiness 6944 from the womb 7358 of the morning: 4891 thou hast the dew 2919 of thy youth. 3208

110:4 The LORD 3068 hath sworn, 7650-8 and will not repent, 5162-11 Thou [art] a priest 3548 for ever 5769 after the order 1700 of Melchizedek. 4442

110:5 The Lord 136 at thy right hand 3225 shall strike 4272-1 through kings 4428 in the day 3117 of his wrath. 639

110:6 He shall judge 1777-4 among the heathen, 1471 he shall fill 4390-1 [the places] with the dead bodies; 1472 he shall wound 4272-1 the heads 7218 over many 7227 countries. 776

110:7 He shall drink 8354-4 of the brook 5158 in the way: 1870 therefore shall he lift up 7311-55 the head. 7218

111:1 Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD. 3050 I will praise 3034-55 the LORD 3068 with [my] whole heart, 3824 in the assembly 5475 of the upright, 3477 and [in] the congregation. 5712

111:2 The works 4639 of the LORD 3068 [are] great, 1419 sought out 1875-7 of all them that have pleasure 2656 therein.

111:3 His work 6467 [is] honourable 1935 and glorious: 1926 and his righteousness 6666 endureth 5975-6 for ever. 5703

111:4 He hath made 6213-1 his wonderful works 6381-12 to be remembered: 2143 the LORD 3068 [is] gracious 2587 and full of compassion. 7349

111:5 He hath given 5414-1 meat 2964 unto them that fear 3373 him: he will ever 5769 be mindful 2142-4 of his covenant. 1285

111:6 He hath shewed 5046-52 his people 5971 the power 3581 of his works, 4639 that he may give 5414-2 them the heritage 5159 of the heathen. 1471

111:7 The works 4639 of his hands 3027 [are] verity 571 and judgment; 4941 all his commandments 6490 [are] sure. 539-12

111:8 They stand fast 5564-7 for ever 5703 and ever, 5769 [and are] done 6213-7 in truth 571 and uprightness. 3477

111:9 He sent 7971-1 redemption 6304 unto his people: 5971 he hath commanded 6680-14 his covenant 1285 for ever: 5769 holy 6918 and reverend 3372-12 [is] his name. 8034

111:10 The fear 3374 of the LORD 3068 [is] the beginning 7225 of wisdom: 2451 a good 2896 understanding 7922 have all they that do 6213-6 [his commandments]: his praise 8416 endureth 5975-6 for ever. 5703

112:1 Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD. 3050 Blessed 835 [is] the man 376 [that] feareth 3372-1 the LORD, 3068 [that] delighteth 2654-1 greatly 3966 in his commandments. 4687

112:2 His seed 2233 shall be mighty 1368 upon earth: 776 the generation 1755 of the upright 3477 shall be blessed. 1288-29

112:3 Wealth 1952 and riches 6239 [shall be] in his house: 1004 and his righteousness 6666 endureth 5975-6 for ever. 5703

112:4 Unto the upright 3477 there ariseth 2224-1 light 216 in the darkness: 2822 [he is] gracious, 2587 and full of compassion, 7349 and righteous. 6662

112:5 A good 2896 man 376 sheweth favour, 2603-6 and lendeth: 3867-56 he will guide 3557-46 his affairs 1697 with discretion. 4941

112:6 Surely he shall not be moved 4131-11 for ever: 5769 the righteous 6662 shall be in everlasting 5769 remembrance. 2143

112:7 He shall not be afraid 3372-4 of evil 7451 tidings: 8052 his heart 3820 is fixed, 3559-12 trusting 982-7 in the LORD. 3068

112:8 His heart 3820 [is] established, 5564-7 he shall not be afraid, 3372-4 until he see 7200-4 [his desire] upon his enemies. 68 2

112:9 He hath dispersed, 6340-14 he hath given 5414-1 to the poor; 34 his righteousness 6666 endureth 5975-6 for ever; 5703 his horn 7161 shall be exalted 7311-4 with honour. 3519

112:10 The wicked 7563 shall see 7200-4 [it], and be grieved; 3707-1 he shall gnash 2786-4 with his teeth, 8127 and melt away: 4549-8 the desire 8378 of the wicked 7563 shall perish. 6-4

113:1 Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD. 3050 Praise, 1984-16 O ye servants 5650 of the LORD, 3068 praise 1984-16 the name 8034 of the LORD. 3068

113:2 Blessed 1288-30 be the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 from this time forth 6258 and for 5704 evermore. 5769

113:3 From the rising 4217 of the sun 8121 unto the going down 3996 of the same the LORD'S 3068 name 8034 [is] to be praised. 1984-30

113:4 The LORD 3068 [is] high 7311-6 above all nations, 1471 [and] his glory 3519 above the heavens. 8064

113:5 Who [is] like unto the LORD 3068 our God, 430 who dwelleth 3427-2 on high, 1361-56

113:6 Who humbleth 8213-56 [himself] to behold 7200-2 [the things that are] in heaven, 8064 and in the earth! 776

113:7 He raiseth up 6965-56 the poor 1800 out of the dust, 6083 [and] lifteth 7311-55 the needy 34 out of the dunghill; 830

113:8 That he may set 3427-53 [him] with princes, 5081 [even] with the princes 5081 of his people. 5971

113:9 He maketh the barren woman 6135 to keep 3427-56 house, 1004 [and to be] a joyful 8056 mother 517 of children. 1121 Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD. 3050

114:1 When Israel 3478 went out 3318-2 of Egypt, 4714 the house 1004 of Jacob 3290 from a people 5971 of strange language; 3937-6

114:2 Judah 3063 was his sanctuary, 6944 [and] Israel 3478 his dominion. 4475

114:3 The sea 3220 saw 7200-1 [it], and fled: 5127-4 Jordan 3383 was driven 5437-11 back. 268

114:4 The mountains 2022 skipped 7540-1 like rams, 352 [and] the little hills 1389 like lambs. 1121 6629

114:5 What [ailed] thee, O thou sea, 3220 that thou fleddest? 5127-4 thou Jordan, 3383 [that] thou wast driven 5437-11 back? 268

114:6 Ye mountains, 2022 [that] ye skipped 7540-4 like rams; 352 [and] ye little hills, 1389 like lambs? 1121 6629

114:7 Tremble, 2342-3 thou earth, 776 at the presence 6440 of the Lord, 113 at the presence 6440 of the God 433 of Jacob; 3290

114:8 Which turned 2015-6 the rock 6697 [into] a standing 98 water, 4325 the flint 2496 into a fountain 4599 of waters. 4325

115:1 Not unto us, O LORD, 3068 not unto us, but unto thy name 8034 give 5414-3 glory, 3519 for thy mercy, 2617 [and] for thy truth's 571 sake.

115:2 Wherefore should the heathen 1471 say, 559-4 Where [is] now their God? 430

115:3 But our God 430 [is] in the heavens: 8064 he hath done 6213-1 whatsoever he hath pleased. 2654-1

115:4 Their idols 6091 [are] silver 3701 and gold, 2091 the work 4639 of men's 120 hands. 3027

115:5 They have mouths, 6310 but they speak 1696-17 not: eyes 5869 have they, but they see 7200-4 not:

115:6 They have ears, 241 but they hear 8085-4 not: noses 639 have they, but they smell 7306-55 not:

115:7 They have hands, 3027 but they handle 4184-55 not: feet 7272 have they, but they walk 1980-17 not: neither speak 1897-4 they through their throat. 1627

115:8 They that make 6213-6 them are like unto them; [so is] every one that trusteth 982-6 in them.

115:9 O Israel, 3478 trust 982-3 thou in the LORD: 3068 he [is] their help 5828 and their shield. 4043

115:10 O house 1004 of Aaron, 175 trust 982-3 in the LORD: 3068 he [is] their help 5828 and their shield. 4043

115:11 Ye that fear 3373 the LORD, 3068 trust 982-3 in the LORD: 3068 he [is] their help 5828 and their shield. 4043

115:12 The LORD 3068 hath been mindful 2142-1 of us: he will bless 1288-17 [us]; he will bless 1288-17 the house 1004 of Israel; 3478 he will bless 1288-17 the house 1004 of Aaron. 175

115:13 He will bless 1288-17 them that fear 3373 the LORD, 3068 [both] small 6996 and great. 1419

115:14 The LORD 3068 shall increase 3254-55 you more and more, you and your children. 1121

115:15 Ye [are] blessed 1288-7 of the LORD 3068 which made 6213-6 heaven 8064 and earth. 776

115:16 The heaven, 8064 [even] the heavens, 8064 [are] the LORD'S: 3068 but the earth 776 hath he given 5414-1 to the children 1121 of men. 120

115:17 The dead 4191-5 praise 1984-17 not the LORD, 3050 neither any that go down 3381-6 into silence. 1745

115:18 But we will bless 1288-17 the LORD 3050 from this time forth and for 5704 evermore. 5769 Praise 1984-16 the LORD. 3050

116:1 I love 157-1 the LORD, 3068 because he hath heard 8085-4 my voice 6963 [and] my supplications. 8469

116:2 Because he hath inclined 5186-52 his ear 241 unto me, therefore will I call 7121-4 upon [him] as long as I live. 3117

116:3 The sorrows 2256 of death 4194 compassed 661-1 me, and the pains 4712 of hell 7585 gat hold 4672-1 upon me: I found 4672-4 trouble 6869 and sorrow. 3015

116:4 Then called 7121-4 I upon the name 8034 of the LORD; 3068 O LORD, 3068 I beseech 577 thee, deliver 4422-16 my soul. 5315

116:5 Gracious 2587 [is] the LORD, 3068 and righteous; 6662 yea, our God 430 [is] merciful. 7355-18

116:6 The LORD 3068 preserveth 8104-6 the simple: 6612 I was brought low, 1809-1 and he helped 3467-55 me.

116:7 Return 7725-3 unto thy rest, 4494 O my soul; 5315 for the LORD 3068 hath dealt bountifully 1580-1 with thee.

116:8 For thou hast delivered 2502-14 my soul 5315 from death, 4194 mine eyes 5869 from tears, 1832 [and] my feet 7272 from falling. 1762

116:9 I will walk 1980-101 before 6440 the LORD 3068 in the land 776 of the living. 2416

116:10 I believed, 539-52 therefore have I spoken: 1696-17 I was greatly 3966 afflicted: 6031-1

116:11 I said 559-1 in my haste, 2648-2 All men 120 [are] liars. 3576-6

116:12 What shall I render 7725-55 unto the LORD 3068 [for] all his benefits 8408 toward me?

116:13 I will take 5375-4 the cup 3563 of salvation, 3444 and call 7121-4 upon the name 8034 of the LORD. 3068

116:14 I will pay 7999-17 my vows 5088 unto the LORD 3068 now in the presence of all his people. 5971

116:15 Precious 3368 in the sight 5869 of the LORD 3068 [is] the death 4194 of his saints. 2623

116:16 O 577 LORD, 3068 truly I [am] thy servant; 5650 I [am] thy servant, 5650 [and] the son 1121 of thine handmaid: 519 thou hast loosed 6605-14 my bonds. 4147

116:17 I will offer 2076-4 to thee the sacrifice 2077 of thanksgiving, 8426 and will call 7121-4 upon the name 8034 of the LORD. 3068

116:18 I will pay 7999-17 my vows 5088 unto the LORD 3068 now in the presence of all his people, 5971

116:19 In the courts 2691 of the LORD'S 3068 house, 1004 in the midst 8432 of thee, O Jerusalem. 3389 Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD. 3050

117:1 O praise 1984-16 the LORD, 3068 all ye nations: 1471 praise 7623-16 him, all ye people. 523

117:2 For his merciful kindness 2617 is great 1396-1 toward us: and the truth 571 of the LORD 3068 [endureth] for ever. 5769 Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD. 3050

118:1 O give thanks 3034-54 unto the LORD; 3068 for [he is] good: 2896 because his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

118:2 Let Israel 3478 now say, 559-4 that his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

118:3 Let the house 1004 of Aaron 175 now say, 559-4 that his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

118:4 Let them now that fear 3373 the LORD 3068 say, 559-4 that his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

118:5 I called 7121-1 upon the LORD 3050 in distress: 4712 the LORD 3050 answered 6030-1 me, [and set me] in a large place. 4800

118:6 The LORD 3068 [is] on my side; I will not fear: 3372-4 what can man 120 do 6213-4 unto me?

118:7 The LORD 3068 taketh my part with them that help 5826-6 me: therefore shall I see 7200-4 [my desire] upon them that hate 8130-6 me.

118:8 [It is] better 2896 to trust 2620-2 in the LORD 3068 than to put confidence 982-2 in man. 120

118:9 [It is] better 2896 to trust 2620-2 in the LORD 3068 than to put confidence 982-2 in princes. 5081

118:10 All nations 1471 compassed me about: 5437-1 but in the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 will I destroy 4135-55 them.

118:11 They compassed me about; 5437-1 yea, they compassed me about: 5437-1 but in the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 I will destroy 4135-55 them.

118:12 They compassed me about 5437-1 like bees; 1682 they are quenched 1846-27 as the fire 784 of thorns: 6975 for in the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 I will destroy 4135-55 them.

118:13 Thou hast thrust 1760-1 sore 1760-2 at me that I might fall: 5307-2 but the LORD 3068 helped 5826-1 me.

118:14 The LORD 3050 [is] my strength 5797 and song, 2176 and is become my salvation. 3444

118:15 The voice 6963 of rejoicing 7440 and salvation 3444 [is] in the tabernacles 168 of the righteous: 6662 the right hand 3225 of the LORD 3068 doeth 6213-6 valiantly. 2428

118:16 The right hand 3225 of the LORD 3068 is exalted: 7426-6 the right hand 3225 of the LORD 3068 doeth 6213-6 valiantly. 2428

118:17 I shall not die, 4191-4 but live, 2421-4 and declare 5608-17 the works 4639 of the LORD. 3050

118:18 The LORD 3050 hath chastened 3256-14 me sore: 3256-15 but he hath not given me over 5414-1 unto death. 4194

118:19 Open 6605-3 to me the gates 8179 of righteousness: 6664 I will go 935-4 into them, [and] I will praise 3034-55 the LORD: 3050

118:20 This gate 8179 of the LORD, 3068 into which the righteous 6662 shall enter. 935-4

118:21 I will praise 3034-55 thee: for thou hast heard 6030-1 me, and art become my salvation. 3444

118:22 The stone 68 [which] the builders 1129-6 refused 3988-1 is become the head 7218 [stone] of the corner. 6438

118:23 This is the LORD'S 3068 doing; it [is] marvellous 6381-8 in our eyes. 5869

118:24 This [is] the day 3117 [which] the LORD 3068 hath made; 6213-1 we will rejoice 1523-4 and be glad 8055-4 in it.

118:25 Save 3467-54 now, I beseech 577 thee, O LORD: 3068 O LORD, 3068 I beseech 577 thee, send now prosperity. 6743-54

118:26 Blessed 1288-7 [be] he that cometh 935-6 in the name 8034 of the LORD: 3068 we have blessed 1288-14 you out of the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

118:27 God 410 [is] the LORD, 3068 which hath shewed us light: 215-55 bind 631-3 the sacrifice 2282 with cords, 5688 [even] unto the horns 7161 of the altar. 4196

118:28 Thou [art] my God, 410 and I will praise 3034-55 thee: [thou art] my God, 430 I will exalt 7311-34 thee.

118:29 O give thanks 3034-54 unto the LORD; 3068 for [he is] good: 2896 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

119:1 ALEPH. Blessed 835 [are] the undefiled 8549 in the way, 1870 who walk 1980-6 in the law 8451 of the LORD. 3068

119:2 Blessed 835 [are] they that keep 5341-6 his testimonies, 5713 [and that] seek 1875-4 him with the whole heart. 3820

119:3 They also do 6466-1 no iniquity: 5766 they walk 1980-1 in his ways. 1870

119:4 Thou hast commanded 6680-14 [us] to keep 8104-2 thy precepts 6490 diligently. 3966

119:5 O that 305 my ways 1870 were directed 3559-11 to keep 8104-2 thy statutes! 2706

119:6 Then shall I not be ashamed, 954-4 when I have respect 5027-53 unto all thy commandments. 4687

119:7 I will praise 3034-55 thee with uprightness 3476 of heart, 3824 when I shall have learned 3925-2 thy righteous 6664 judgments. 4941

119:8 I will keep 8104-4 thy statutes: 2706 O forsake 5800-4 me not utterly. 3966

119:9 BETH. Wherewithal shall a young man 5288 cleanse 2135-17 his way? 734 by taking heed 8104-2 [thereto] according to thy word. 1697

119:10 With my whole heart 3820 have I sought 1875-1 thee: O let me not wander 7686-55 from thy commandments. 4687

119:11 Thy word 565 have I hid 6845-1 in mine heart, 3820 that I might not sin 2398-4 against thee.

119:12 Blessed 1288-7 [art] thou, O LORD: 3068 teach 3925-16 me thy statutes. 2706

119:13 With my lips 8193 have I declared 5608-14 all the judgments 4941 of thy mouth. 6310

119:14 I have rejoiced 7797-1 in the way 1870 of thy testimonies, 5715 as [much as] in 5921 all riches. 1952

119:15 I will meditate 7878-4 in thy precepts, 6490 and have respect 5027-55 unto thy ways. 734

119:16 I will delight 8173-118 myself in thy statutes: 2708 I will not forget 7911-4 thy word. 1697

119:17 GIMEL. Deal bountifully 1580-3 with thy servant, 5650 [that] I may live, 2421-4 and keep 8104-4 thy word. 1697

119:18 Open 1540-16 thou mine eyes, 5869 that I may behold 5027-55 wondrous things 6381-12 out of thy law. 8451

119:19 I [am] a stranger 1616 in the earth: 776 hide 5641-55 not thy commandments 4687 from me.

119:20 My soul 5315 breaketh 1638-1 for the longing 8375 [that it hath] unto thy judgments 4941 at all times. 6256

119:21 Thou hast rebuked 1605-1 the proud 2086 [that are] cursed, 779-7 which do err 7686-6 from thy commandments. 4687

119:22 Remove 1556-3 from me reproach 2781 and contempt; 937 for I have kept 5341-1 thy testimonies. 5713

119:23 Princes 8269 also did sit 3427-1 [and] speak 1696-8 against me: [but] thy servant 5650 did meditate 7878-4 in thy statutes. 2706

119:24 Thy testimonies 5713 also [are] my delight 8191 [and] my counsellors. 582 6098

119:25 DALETH. My soul 5315 cleaveth 1692-1 unto the dust: 6083 quicken 2421-16 thou me according to thy word. 1697

119:26 I have declared 5608-14 my ways, 1870 and thou heardest 6030-4 me: teach 3925-16 me thy statutes. 2706

119:27 Make me to understand 995-54 the way 1870 of thy precepts: 6490 so shall I talk 7878-4 of thy wondrous works. 6381-12

119:28 My soul 5315 melteth 1811-1 for heaviness: 8424 strengthen 6965-16 thou me according unto thy word. 1697

119:29 Remove 5493-54 from me the way 1870 of lying: 8267 and grant me thy law 8451 graciously. 2603-3

119:30 I have chosen 977-1 the way 1870 of truth: 530 thy judgments 4941 have I laid 7737-14 [before me].

119:31 I have stuck 1692-1 unto thy testimonies: 5715 O LORD, 3068 put me not to shame. 954-55

119:32 I will run 7323-4 the way 1870 of thy commandments, 4687 when thou shalt enlarge 7337-55 my heart. 3820

119:33 HE. Teach 3384-54 me, O LORD, 3068 the way 1870 of thy statutes; 2706 and I shall keep 5341-4 it [unto] the end. 6118

119:34 Give me understanding, 995-54 and I shall keep 5341-4 thy law; 8451 yea, I shall observe 8104-4 it with [my] whole heart. 3820

119:35 Make me to go 1869-54 in the path 5410 of thy commandments; 4687 for therein do I delight. 2654-1

119:36 Incline 5186-54 my heart 3820 unto thy testimonies, 5715 and not to covetousness. 1215

119:37 Turn away 5674-54 mine eyes 5869 from beholding 7200-2 vanity; 7723 [and] quicken 2421-16 thou me in thy way. 1870

119:38 Stablish 6965-54 thy word 565 unto thy servant, 5650 who [is devoted] to thy fear. 3374

119:39 Turn away 5674-54 my reproach 2781 which I fear: 3025-1 for thy judgments 4941 [are] good. 2896

119:40 Behold, I have longed 8373-1 after thy precepts: 6490 quicken 2421-16 me in thy righteousness. 6666

119:41 VAU. Let thy mercies 2617 come 935-4 also unto me, O LORD, 3068 [even] thy salvation, 8668 according to thy word. 565

119:42 So shall I have wherewith 1697 to answer 6030-4 him that reproacheth 2778-6 me: for I trust 982-1 in thy word. 1697

119:43 And take 5337-55 not the word 1697 of truth 571 utterly 3966 out of my mouth; 6310 for I have hoped 3176-14 in thy judgments. 4941

119:44 So shall I keep 8104-4 thy law 8451 continually 8548 for ever 5769 and ever. 5703

119:45 And I will walk 1980-101 at liberty: 7342 for I seek 1875-1 thy precepts. 6490

119:46 I will speak 1696-17 of thy testimonies 5713 also before kings, 4428 and will not be ashamed. 954-4

119:47 And I will delight 8173-118 myself in thy commandments, 4687 which I have loved. 157-1

119:48 My hands 3709 also will I lift up 5375-4 unto thy commandments, 4687 which I have loved; 157-1 and I will meditate 7878-4 in thy statutes. 2706

119:49 ZAIN. Remember 2142-3 the word 1697 unto thy servant, 5650 upon which thou hast caused me to hope. 3176-14

119:50 This [is] my comfort 5165 in my affliction: 6040 for thy word 565 hath quickened 2421-14 me.

119:51 The proud 2086 have had me greatly 3966 in derision: 3887-52 [yet] have I not declined 5186-1 from thy law. 8451

119:52 I remembered 2142-1 thy judgments 4941 of old, 5769 O LORD; 3068 and have comforted 5162-101 myself.

119:53 Horror 2152 hath taken hold upon me 270-1 because of the wicked 7563 that forsake 5800-6 thy law. 8451

119:54 Thy statutes 2706 have been my songs 2158 in the house 1004 of my pilgrimage. 4033

119:55 I have remembered 2142-1 thy name, 8034 O LORD, 3068 in the night, 3915 and have kept 8104-4 thy law. 8451

119:56 This I had, because I kept 5341-1 thy precepts. 6490

119:57 CHETH. [Thou art] my portion, 2506 O LORD: 3068 I have said 559-1 that I would keep 8104-2 thy words. 1697

119:58 I intreated 2470-14 thy favour 6440 with [my] whole heart: 3820 be merciful 2603-3 unto me according to thy word. 565

119:59 I thought 2803-14 on my ways, 1870 and turned 7725-55 my feet 7272 unto thy testimonies. 5713

119:60 I made haste, 2363-1 and delayed 4102-115 not to keep 8104-2 thy commandments. 4687

119:61 The bands 2256 of the wicked 7563 have robbed 5749-14 me: [but] I have not forgotten 7911-1 thy law. 8451

119:62 At midnight 2676 3915 I will rise 6965-4 to give thanks 3034-53 unto thee because of thy righteous 6664 judgments. 4941

119:63 I [am] a companion 2270 of all [them] that fear 3372-1 thee, and of them that keep 8104-6 thy precepts. 6490

119:64 The earth, 776 O LORD, 3068 is full 4390-1 of thy mercy: 2617 teach 3925-16 me thy statutes. 2706

119:65 TETH. Thou hast dealt 6213-1 well 2896 with thy servant, 5650 O LORD, 3068 according unto thy word. 1697

119:66 Teach 3925-16 me good 2898 judgment 2940 and knowledge: 1847 for I have believed 539-52 thy commandments. 4687

119:67 Before I was afflicted 6031-4 I went astray: 7683-6 but now have I kept 8104-1 thy word. 565

119:68 Thou [art] good, 2896 and doest good; 2895-56 teach 3925-16 me thy statutes. 2706

119:69 The proud 2086 have forged 2950-1 a lie 8267 against me: [but] I will keep 5341-4 thy precepts 6490 with [my] whole heart. 3820

119:70 Their heart 3820 is as fat 2954-1 as grease; 2459 [but] I delight 8173-43 in thy law. 8451

119:71 [It is] good 2896 for me that I have been afflicted; 6031-27 that I might learn 3925-4 thy statutes. 2706

119:72 The law 8451 of thy mouth 6310 [is] better 2896 unto me than thousands 505 of gold 2091 and silver. 3701

119:73 JOD. Thy hands 3027 have made 6213-1 me and fashioned 3559-34 me: give me understanding, 995-54 that I may learn 3925-4 thy commandments. 4687

119:74 They that fear 3373 thee will be glad 8055-4 when they see 7200-4 me; because I have hoped 3176-14 in thy word. 1697

119:75 I know, 3045-1 O LORD, 3068 that thy judgments 4941 [are] right, 6664 and [that] thou in faithfulness 530 hast afflicted 6031-14 me.

119:76 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness 2617 be for my comfort, 5162-15 according to thy word 565 unto thy servant. 5650

119:77 Let thy tender mercies 7356 come 935-4 unto me, that I may live: 2421-4 for thy law 8451 [is] my delight. 8191

119:78 Let the proud 2086 be ashamed; 954-4 for they dealt perversely 5791-14 with me without a cause: 8267 [but] I will meditate 7878-4 in thy precepts. 6490

119:79 Let those that fear 3373 thee turn 7725-4 unto me, and those that have known 3045-6|3045-1-k thy testimonies. 5713

119:80 Let my heart 3820 be sound 8549 in thy statutes; 2706 that I be not ashamed. 954-4

119:81 CAPH. My soul 5315 fainteth 3615-1 for thy salvation: 8668 [but] I hope 3176-14 in thy word. 1697

119:82 Mine eyes 5869 fail 3615-1 for thy word, 565 saying, 559-2 When wilt thou comfort 5162-17 me?

119:83 For I am become like a bottle 4997 in the smoke; 7008 [yet] do I not forget 7911-1 thy statutes. 2706

119:84 How many [are] the days 3117 of thy servant? 5650 when wilt thou execute 6213-4 judgment 4941 on them that persecute 7291-6 me?

119:85 The proud 2086 have digged 3738-1 pits 7882 for me, which [are] not after thy law. 8451

119:86 All thy commandments 4687 [are] faithful: 530 they persecute 7291-1 me wrongfully; 8267 help 5826-3 thou me.

119:87 They had almost 4592 consumed 3615-14 me upon earth; 776 but I forsook 5800-1 not thy precepts. 6490

119:88 Quicken 2421-16 me after thy lovingkindness; 2617 so shall I keep 8104-4 the testimony 5715 of thy mouth. 6310

119:89 LAMED. For ever, 5769 O LORD, 3068 thy word 1697 is settled 5324-12 in heaven. 8064

119:90 Thy faithfulness 530 [is] unto all 1755 generations: 1755 thou hast established 3559-31 the earth, 776 and it abideth. 5975-4

119:91 They continue 5975-1 this day 3117 according to thine ordinances: 4941 for all [are] thy servants. 5650

119:92 Unless 3884 thy law 8451 [had been] my delights, 8191 I should then have perished 6-1 in mine affliction. 6040

119:93 I will never 3808 5769 forget 7911-4 thy precepts: 6490 for with them thou hast quickened 2421-14 me.

119:94 I [am] thine, save 3467-54 me; for I have sought 1875-1 thy precepts. 6490

119:95 The wicked 7563 have waited 6960-14 for me to destroy 6-15 me: [but] I will consider 995-113 thy testimonies. 5713

119:96 I have seen 7200-1 an end 7093 of all perfection: 8502 [but] thy commandment 4687 [is] exceeding 3966 broad. 7342

119:97 MEM. O how love I 157-1 thy law! 8451 it [is] my meditation 7881 all the day. 3117

119:98 Thou through thy commandments 4687 hast made me wiser 2449-17 than mine enemies: 341-6 for they [are] ever 5769 with me.

119:99 I have more understanding 7919-52 than all my teachers: 3925-18 for thy testimonies 5715 [are] my meditation. 7881

119:100 I understand 995-113 more than the ancients, 2205 because I keep 5341-1 thy precepts. 6490

119:101 I have refrained 3607-1 my feet 7272 from every evil 7451 way, 734 that I might keep 8104-4 thy word. 1697

119:102 I have not departed 5493-1 from thy judgments: 4941 for thou hast taught 3384-52 me.

119:103 How sweet 4452-8 are thy words 565 unto my taste! 2441 [yea, sweeter] than honey 1706 to my mouth! 6310

119:104 Through thy precepts 6490 I get understanding: 995-113 therefore I hate 8130-1 every false 8267 way. 734

119:105 NUN. Thy word 1697 [is] a lamp 5216 unto my feet, 7272 and a light 216 unto my path. 5410

119:106 I have sworn, 7650-8 and I will perform 6965-17 [it], that I will keep 8104-2 thy righteous 6664 judgments. 4941

119:107 I am afflicted 6031-8 very much: 3966 quicken 2421-16 me, O LORD, 3068 according unto thy word. 1697

119:108 Accept, 7521-3 I beseech thee, the freewill offerings 5071 of my mouth, 6310 O LORD, 3068 and teach 3925-16 me thy judgments. 4941

119:109 My soul 5315 [is] continually 8548 in my hand: 3709 yet do I not forget 7911-1 thy law. 8451

119:110 The wicked 7563 have laid 5414-1 a snare 6341 for me: yet I erred 8582-1 not from thy precepts. 6490

119:111 Thy testimonies 5715 have I taken as an heritage 5157-1 for ever: 5769 for they [are] the rejoicing 8342 of my heart. 3820

119:112 I have inclined 5186-1 mine heart 3820 to perform 6213-2 thy statutes 2706 alway, 5769 [even unto] the end. 6118

119:113 SAMECH. I hate 8130-1 [vain] thoughts: 5588 but thy law 8451 do I love. 157-1

119:114 Thou [art] my hiding place 5643 and my shield: 4043 I hope 3176-14 in thy word. 1697

119:115 Depart 5493-3 from me, ye evildoers: 7489-56 for I will keep 5341-4 the commandments 4687 of my God. 430

119:116 Uphold 5564-3 me according unto thy word, 565 that I may live: 2421-4 and let me not be ashamed 954-55 of my hope. 7664

119:117 Hold thou me up, 5582-3 and I shall be safe: 3467-11 and I will have respect 8159-4 unto thy statutes 2706 continually. 8548

119:118 Thou hast trodden down 5541-1 all them that err 7686-6 from thy statutes: 2706 for their deceit 8649 [is] falsehood. 8267

119:119 Thou puttest away 7673-52 all the wicked 7563 of the earth 776 [like] dross: 5509 therefore I love 157-1 thy testimonies. 5713

119:120 My flesh 1320 trembleth 5568-1 for fear 6343 of thee; and I am afraid 3372-1 of thy judgments. 4941

119:121 AIN. I have done 6213-1 judgment 4941 and justice: 6664 leave 3240-55 me not to mine oppressors. 6231-6

119:122 Be surety 6148-3 for thy servant 5650 for good: 2896 let not the proud 2086 oppress 6231-4 me.

119:123 Mine eyes 5869 fail 3615-1 for thy salvation, 3444 and for the word 565 of thy righteousness. 6664

119:124 Deal 6213-3 with thy servant 5650 according unto thy mercy, 2617 and teach 3925-16 me thy statutes. 2706

119:125 I [am] thy servant; 5650 give me understanding, 995-54 that I may know 3045-4 thy testimonies. 5713

119:126 [It is] time 6256 for [thee], LORD, 3068 to work: 6213-2 [for] they have made void 6565-52 thy law. 8451

119:127 Therefore I love 157-1 thy commandments 4687 above gold; 2091 yea, above fine gold. 6337

119:128 Therefore I esteem all [thy] precepts 6490 [concerning] all [things to be] right; 3474-14 [and] I hate 8130-1 every false 8267 way. 734

119:129 PE. Thy testimonies 5715 [are] wonderful: 6382 therefore doth my soul 5315 keep 5341-1 them.

119:130 The entrance 6608 of thy words 1697 giveth light; 215-55 it giveth understanding 995-56 unto the simple. 6612

119:131 I opened 6473-1 my mouth, 6310 and panted: 7602-4 for I longed 2968-1 for thy commandments. 4687

119:132 Look 6437-3 thou upon me, and be merciful 2603-3 unto me, as thou usest to do 4941 unto those that love 157-6 thy name. 8034

119:133 Order 3559-54 my steps 6471 in thy word: 565 and let not any iniquity 205 have dominion 7980-55 over me.

119:134 Deliver 6299-3 me from the oppression 6233 of man: 120 so will I keep 8104-4 thy precepts. 6490

119:135 Make thy face 6440 to shine 215-54 upon thy servant; 5650 and teach 3925-16 me thy statutes. 2706

119:136 Rivers 6388 of waters 4325 run down 3381-1 mine eyes, 5869 because they keep 8104-1 not thy law. 8451

119:137 TZADDI. Righteous 6662 [art] thou, O LORD, 3068 and upright 3477 [are] thy judgments. 4941

119:138 Thy testimonies 5713 [that] thou hast commanded 6680-14 [are] righteous 6664 and very 3966 faithful. 530

119:139 My zeal 7068 hath consumed 6789-14 me, because mine enemies 6862 have forgotten 7911-1 thy words. 1697

119:140 Thy word 565 [is] very 3966 pure: 6884-7 therefore thy servant 5650 loveth 157-1 it.

119:141 I [am] small 6810 and despised: 959-12 [yet] do not I forget 7911-1 thy precepts. 6490

119:142 Thy righteousness 6666 [is] an everlasting 5769 righteousness, 6664 and thy law 8451 [is] the truth. 571

119:143 Trouble 6862 and anguish 4689 have taken hold 4672-1 on me: [yet] thy commandments 4687 [are] my delights. 8191

119:144 The righteousness 6664 of thy testimonies 5715 [is] everlasting: 5769 give me understanding, 995-54 and I shall live. 2421-4

119:145 KOPH. I cried 7121-1 with [my] whole heart; 3820 hear 6030-3 me, O LORD: 3068 I will keep 5341-4 thy statutes. 2706

119:146 I cried 7121-1 unto thee; save 3467-54 me, and I shall keep 8104-4 thy testimonies. 5713

119:147 I prevented 6923-14 the dawning of the morning, 5399 and cried: 7768-17 I hoped 3176-14 in thy word. 1697

119:148 Mine eyes 5869 prevent 6923-14 the [night] watches, 821 that I might meditate 7878-2 in thy word. 565

119:149 Hear 8085-3 my voice 6963 according unto thy lovingkindness: 2617 O LORD, 3068 quicken 2421-16 me according to thy judgment. 4941

119:150 They draw nigh 7126-1 that follow 7291-6 after mischief: 2154 they are far 7368-1 from thy law. 8451

119:151 Thou [art] near, 7138 O LORD; 3068 and all thy commandments 4687 [are] truth. 571

119:152 Concerning thy testimonies, 5713 I have known 3045-1 of old 6924 that thou hast founded 3245-1 them for ever. 5769

119:153 RESH. Consider 7200-3 mine affliction, 6040 and deliver 2502-16 me: for I do not forget 7911-1 thy law. 8451

119:154 Plead 7378-3 my cause, 7379 and deliver 1350-3 me: quicken 2421-16 me according to thy word. 565

119:155 Salvation 3444 [is] far 7350 from the wicked: 7563 for they seek 1875-1 not thy statutes. 2706

119:156 Great 7227 [are] thy tender mercies, 7356 O LORD: 3068 quicken 2421-16 me according to thy judgments. 4941

119:157 Many 7227 [are] my persecutors 7291-6 and mine enemies; 6862 [yet] do I not decline 5186-1 from thy testimonies. 5715

119:158 I beheld 7200-1 the transgressors, 898-6 and was grieved; 6962-113 because they kept 8104-1 not thy word. 565

119:159 Consider 7200-3 how I love 157-1 thy precepts: 6490 quicken 2421-16 me, O LORD, 3068 according to thy lovingkindness. 2617

119:160 Thy word 1697 [is] true 571 [from] the beginning: 7218 and every one of thy righteous 6664 judgments 4941 [endureth] for ever. 5769

119:161 SCHIN. Princes 8269 have persecuted 7291-1 me without a cause: 2600 but my heart 3820 standeth in awe 6342-1 of thy word. 1697

119:162 I rejoice 7797-5 at thy word, 565 as one that findeth 4672-6 great 7227 spoil. 7998

119:163 I hate 8130-1 and abhor 8581-17 lying: 8267 [but] thy law 8451 do I love. 157-1

119:164 Seven times 7651 a day 3117 do I praise 1984-14 thee because of thy righteous 6664 judgments. 4941

119:165 Great 7227 peace 7965 have they which love 157-6 thy law: 8451 and nothing shall offend 4383 them.

119:166 LORD, 3068 I have hoped 7663-14 for thy salvation, 3444 and done 6213-1 thy commandments. 4687

119:167 My soul 5315 hath kept 8104-1 thy testimonies; 5713 and I love 157-4 them exceedingly. 3966

119:168 I have kept 8104-1 thy precepts 6490 and thy testimonies: 5713 for all my ways 1870 [are] before thee.

119:169 TAU. Let my cry 7440 come near 7126-4 before 6440 thee, O LORD: 3068 give me understanding 995-54 according to thy word. 1697

119:170 Let my supplication 8467 come 935-4 before 6440 thee: deliver 5337-54 me according to thy word. 565

119:171 My lips 8193 shall utter 5042-55 praise, 8416 when thou hast taught 3925-17 me thy statutes. 2706

119:172 My tongue 3956 shall speak 6030-4 of thy word: 565 for all thy commandments 4687 [are] righteousness. 6664

119:173 Let thine hand 3027 help 5826-2 me; for I have chosen 977-1 thy precepts. 6490

119:174 I have longed 8373-1 for thy salvation, 3444 O LORD; 3068 and thy law 8451 [is] my delight. 8191

119:175 Let my soul 5315 live, 2421-4 and it shall praise 1984-17 thee; and let thy judgments 4941 help 5826-4 me.

119:176 I have gone astray 8582-1 like a lost 6-6 sheep; 7716 seek 1245-16 thy servant; 5650 for I do not forget 7911-1 thy commandments. 4687

120:1 <A Song 7892 of degrees.> 4609 In my distress 6869 I cried 7121-1 unto the LORD, 3068 and he heard 6030-4 me.

120:2 Deliver 5337-54 my soul, 5315 O LORD, 3068 from lying 8267 lips, 8193 [and] from a deceitful 7423 tongue. 3956

120:3 What shall be given 5414-4 unto thee? or what shall be done 3254-55 unto thee, thou false 7423 tongue? 3956

120:4 Sharp 8150-6 arrows 2671 of the mighty, 1368 with coals 1513 of juniper. 7574

120:5 Woe 190 is me, that I sojourn 1481-1 in Mesech, 4902 [that] I dwell 7931-1 in the tents 168 of Kedar! 6938

120:6 My soul 5315 hath long 7227 dwelt 7931-1 with him that hateth 8130-6 peace. 7965

120:7 I [am for] peace: 7965 but when I speak, 1696-17 they [are] for war. 4421

121:1 <A Song 7892 of degrees.> 4609 I will lift up 5375-4 mine eyes 5869 unto the hills, 2022 from whence 370 cometh 935-4 my help. 5828

121:2 My help 5828 [cometh] from the LORD, 3068 which made 6213-6 heaven 8064 and earth. 776

121:3 He will not suffer 5414-4 thy foot 7272 to be moved: 4132 he that keepeth 8104-6 thee will not slumber. 5123-4

121:4 Behold, he that keepeth 8104-6 Israel 3478 shall neither slumber 5123-4 nor sleep. 3462-4

121:5 The LORD 3068 [is] thy keeper: 8104-6 the LORD 3068 [is] thy shade 6738 upon thy right 3225 hand. 3027

121:6 The sun 8121 shall not smite 5221-55 thee by day, 3119 nor the moon 3394 by night. 3915

121:7 The LORD 3068 shall preserve 8104-4 thee from all evil: 7451 he shall preserve 8104-4 thy soul. 5315

121:8 The LORD 3068 shall preserve 8104-4 thy going out 3318-2 and thy coming in 935-2 from this time forth, and even for 5704 evermore. 5769

122:1 <A Song 7892 of degrees 4609 of David.> 1732 I was glad 8055-1 when they said 559-6 unto me, Let us go 3212-4 into the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

122:2 Our feet 7272 shall stand 5975-6 within thy gates, 8179 O Jerusalem. 3389

122:3 Jerusalem 3389 is builded 1129-7 as a city 5892 that is compact 2266-27 together: 3162

122:4 Whither 8033 the tribes 7626 go up, 5927-1 the tribes 7626 of the LORD, 3050 unto the testimony 5715 of Israel, 3478 to give thanks 3034-53 unto the name 8034 of the LORD. 3068

122:5 For there are set 3427-1 thrones 3678 of judgment, 4941 the thrones 3678 of the house 1004 of David. 1732

122:6 Pray 7592-3 for the peace 7965 of Jerusalem: 3389 they shall prosper 7951-4 that love 157-6 thee.

122:7 Peace 7965 be within thy walls, 2426 [and] prosperity 7962 within thy palaces. 759

122:8 For my brethren 251 and companions' 7453 sakes, I will now say, 1696-17 Peace 7965 [be] within thee.

122:9 Because of the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 our God 430 I will seek 1245-17 thy good. 2896

123:1 <A Song 7892 of degrees.> 4609 Unto thee lift I up 5375-1 mine eyes, 5869 O thou that dwellest 3427-6 in the heavens. 8064

123:2 Behold, as the eyes 5869 of servants 5650 [look] unto the hand 3027 of their masters, 113 [and] as the eyes 5869 of a maiden 8198 unto the hand 3027 of her mistress; 1404 so our eyes 5869 [wait] upon the LORD 3068 our God, 430 until that he have mercy 2603-4 upon us.

123:3 Have mercy 2603-3 upon us, O LORD, 3068 have mercy 2603-3 upon us: for we are exceedingly 7227 filled 7646-1 with contempt. 937

123:4 Our soul 5315 is exceedingly 7227 filled 7646-1 with the scorning 3933 of those that are at ease, 7600 [and] with the contempt 937 of the proud. 1343|3238-6|1349-q

124:1 <A Song 7892 of degrees 4609 of David.> 1732 If 3884 [it had not been] the LORD 3068 who was on our side, now may Israel 3478 say; 559-4

124:2 If 3884 [it had not been] the LORD 3068 who was on our side, when men 120 rose up 6965-2 against us:

124:3 Then 233 they had swallowed us up 1104-1 quick, 2416 when their wrath 639 was kindled 2734-2 against us:

124:4 Then 233 the waters 4325 had overwhelmed 7857-1 us, the stream 5158 had gone over 5674-1 our soul: 5315

124:5 Then 233 the proud 2121 waters 4325 had gone over 5674-1 our soul. 5315

124:6 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD, 3068 who hath not given 5414-1 us [as] a prey 2964 to their teeth. 8127

124:7 Our soul 5315 is escaped 4422-8 as a bird 6833 out of the snare 6341 of the fowlers: 3369-6 the snare 6341 is broken, 7665-8 and we are escaped. 4422-8

124:8 Our help 5828 [is] in the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 who made 6213-6 heaven 8064 and earth. 776

125:1 <A Song 7892 of degrees.> 4609 They that trust 982-6 in the LORD 3068 [shall be] as mount 2022 Zion, 6726 [which] cannot be removed, 4131-11 [but] abideth 3427-4 for ever. 5769

125:2 As the mountains 2022 [are] round about 5439 Jerusalem, 3389 so the LORD 3068 [is] round about 5439 his people 5971 from henceforth even for 5704 ever. 5769

125:3 For the rod 7626 of the wicked 7562 shall not rest 5117-4 upon the lot 1486 of the righteous; 6662 lest 4616 the righteous 6662 put forth 7971-4 their hands 3027 unto iniquity. 5766

125:4 Do good, 2895-54 O LORD, 3068 unto [those that be] good, 2896 and [to them that are] upright 3477 in their hearts. 3826

125:5 As for such as turn aside 5186-56 unto their crooked ways, 6128 the LORD 3068 shall lead them forth 3212-55 with the workers 6466-6 of iniquity: 205 [but] peace 7965 [shall be] upon Israel. 3478

126:1 <A Song 7892 of degrees.> 4609 When the LORD 3068 turned again 7725-2 the captivity 7870 of Zion, 6726 we were like them that dream. 2492-6

126:2 Then was our mouth 6310 filled 4390-11 with laughter, 7814 and our tongue 3956 with singing: 7440 then said 559-4 they among the heathen, 1471 The LORD 3068 hath done 6213-2 great things 1431-52 for them.

126:3 The LORD 3068 hath done 6213-2 great things 1431-52 for us; [whereof] we are glad. 8056

126:4 Turn again 7725-3 our captivity, 7622|7622-k O LORD, 3068 as the streams 650 in the south. 5045

126:5 They that sow 2232-6 in tears 1832 shall reap 7114-4 in joy. 7440

126:6 He that goeth 3212-4 forth 1980-2 and weepeth, 1058-2 bearing 5375-6 precious 4901 seed, 2233 shall doubtless 935-2 come 935-4 again with rejoicing, 7440 bringing 5375-6 his sheaves 485 [with him].

127:1 <A Song 7892 of degrees 4609 for Solomon.> 8010 Except the LORD 3068 build 1129-4 the house, 1004 they labour 5998-1 in vain 7723 that build 1129-6 it: except the LORD 3068 keep 8104-4 the city, 5892 the watchman 8104-6 waketh 8245-1 [but] in vain. 7723

127:2 [It is] vain 7723 for you to rise up 6965-2 early, 7925-56 to sit up 3427-2 late, 309-18 to eat 398-6 the bread 3899 of sorrows: 6089 [for] so he giveth 5414-4 his beloved 3039 sleep. 8142

127:3 Lo, children 1121 [are] an heritage 5159 of the LORD: 3068 [and] the fruit 6529 of the womb 990 [is his] reward. 7939

127:4 As arrows 2671 [are] in the hand 3027 of a mighty man; 1368 so [are] children 1121 of the youth. 5271

127:5 Happy 835 [is] the man 1397 that hath his quiver 827 full 4390-14 of them: they shall not be ashamed, 954-4 but they shall speak 1696-17 with the enemies 341-6 in the gate. 8179

128:1 <A Song 7892 of degrees.> 4609 Blessed 835 [is] every one that feareth 3373 the LORD; 3068 that walketh 1980-6 in his ways. 1870

128:2 For thou shalt eat 398-4 the labour 3018 of thine hands: 3709 happy 835 [shalt] thou [be], and [it shall be] well 2896 with thee.

128:3 Thy wife 802 [shall be] as a fruitful 6509-6 vine 1612 by the sides 3411 of thine house: 1004 thy children 1121 like olive 2132 plants 8363 round about 5439 thy table. 7979

128:4 Behold, that thus shall the man 1397 be blessed 1288-29 that feareth 3373 the LORD. 3068

128:5 The LORD 3068 shall bless 1288-17 thee out of Zion: 6726 and thou shalt see 7200-3 the good 2898 of Jerusalem 3389 all the days 3117 of thy life. 2416

128:6 Yea, thou shalt see 7200-3 thy children's 1121 children, 1121 [and] peace 7965 upon Israel. 3478

129:1 <A Song 7892 of degrees.> 4609 Many a time 7227 have they afflicted 6887-1 me from my youth, 5271 may Israel 3478 now say: 559-4

129:2 Many a time 7227 have they afflicted 6887-1 me from my youth: 5271 yet they have not prevailed 3201-1 against me.

129:3 The plowers 2790-6 plowed 2790-1 upon my back: 1354 they made long 748-52 their furrows. 4618|4618-k

129:4 The LORD 3068 [is] righteous: 6662 he hath cut asunder 7112-14 the cords 5688 of the wicked. 7563

129:5 Let them all be confounded 954-4 and turned 5472-11 back 268 that hate 8130-6 Zion. 6726

129:6 Let them be as the grass 2682 [upon] the housetops, 1406 which withereth 3001-1 afore 6927 it groweth up: 8025-1

129:7 Wherewith the mower 7114-6 filleth 4390-14 not his hand; 3709 nor he that bindeth sheaves 6014-18 his bosom. 2683

129:8 Neither do they which go by 5674-6 say, 559-1 The blessing 1293 of the LORD 3068 [be] upon you: we bless 1288-14 you in the name 8034 of the LORD. 3068

130:1 <A Song 7892 of degrees.> 4609 Out of the depths 4615 have I cried 7121-1 unto thee, O LORD. 3068

130:2 Lord, 136 hear 8085-3 my voice: 6963 let thine ears 241 be attentive 7183 to the voice 6963 of my supplications. 8469

130:3 If thou, LORD, 3050 shouldest mark 8104-4 iniquities, 5771 O Lord, 136 who shall stand? 5975-4

130:4 But [there is] forgiveness 5547 with thee, that thou mayest be feared. 3372-11

130:5 I wait 6960-14 for the LORD, 3068 my soul 5315 doth wait, 6960-14 and in his word 1697 do I hope. 3176-52

130:6 My soul 5315 [waiteth] for the Lord 136 more than they that watch 8104-6 for the morning: 1242 [I say, more than] they that watch 8104-6 for the morning. 1242

130:7 Let Israel 3478 hope 3176-16 in the LORD: 3068 for with the LORD 3068 [there is] mercy, 2617 and with him [is] plenteous 7235-53 redemption. 6304

130:8 And he shall redeem 6299-4 Israel 3478 from all his iniquities. 5771

131:1 <A Song 7892 of degrees 4609 of David.> 1732 LORD, 3068 my heart 3820 is not haughty, 1361-1 nor mine eyes 5869 lofty: 7311-1 neither do I exercise 1980-14 myself in great matters, 1419 or in things too high 6381-12 for me.

131:2 Surely I have behaved 7737-14 and quieted 1826-19 myself, 5315 as a child that is weaned 1580-7 of his mother: 517 my soul 5315 [is] even as a weaned child. 1580-7

131:3 Let Israel 3478 hope 3176-16 in the LORD 3068 from henceforth and for 5704 ever. 5769

132:1 A Song 7892 of degrees. 4609 LORD, 3068 remember 2142-3 David, 1732 [and] all his afflictions: 6031-28

132:2 How he sware 7650-8 unto the LORD, 3068 [and] vowed 5087-1 unto the mighty 46 [God] of Jacob; 3290

132:3 Surely I will not come 935-4 into the tabernacle 168 of my house, 1004 nor go up 5927-4 into my bed; 6210 3326

132:4 I will not give 5414-4 sleep 8153 to mine eyes, 5869 [or] slumber 8572 to mine eyelids, 6079

132:5 Until I find 4672-4 out a place 4725 for the LORD, 3068 an habitation 4908 for the mighty 46 [God] of Jacob. 3290

132:6 Lo, we heard 8085-1 of it at Ephratah: 672 we found 4672-1 it in the fields 7704 of the wood. 3293

132:7 We will go 935-4 into his tabernacles: 4908 we will worship 7812-101 at his footstool. 1916 7272

132:8 Arise, 6965-3 O LORD, 3068 into thy rest; 4496 thou, and the ark 727 of thy strength. 5797

132:9 Let thy priests 3548 be clothed 3847-4 with righteousness; 6664 and let thy saints 2623 shout for joy. 7442-17

132:10 For thy servant 5650 David's 1732 sake turn not away 7725-55 the face 6440 of thine anointed. 4899

132:11 The LORD 3068 hath sworn 7650-8 [in] truth 571 unto David; 1732 he will not turn 7725-4 from it; Of the fruit 6529 of thy body 990 will I set 7896-4 upon thy throne. 3678

132:12 If thy children 1121 will keep 8104-4 my covenant 1285 and my testimony 5713 that 2090|2097-k I shall teach 3925-17 them, their children 1121 shall also sit 3427-4 upon thy throne 3678 for evermore. 5703

132:13 For the LORD 3068 hath chosen 977-1 Zion; 6726 he hath desired 183-14 [it] for his habitation. 4186

132:14 This [is] my rest 4496 for ever: 5703 here will I dwell; 3427-4 for I have desired 183-14 it.

132:15 I will abundantly 1288-15 bless 1288-17 her provision: 6718 I will satisfy 7646-55 her poor 34 with bread. 3899

132:16 I will also clothe 3847-55 her priests 3548 with salvation: 3468 and her saints 2623 shall shout 7442-17 aloud for joy. 7444-15

132:17 There will I make the horn 7161 of David 1732 to bud: 6779-55 I have ordained 6186-1 a lamp 5216 for mine anointed. 4899

132:18 His enemies 341-6 will I clothe 3847-55 with shame: 1322 but upon himself shall his crown 5145 flourish. 6692-55

133:1 <A Song 7892 of degrees 4609 of David.> 1732 Behold, how good 2896 and how pleasant 5273 [it is] for brethren 251 to dwell 3427-2 together 3162 in unity!

133:2 [It is] like the precious 2896 ointment 8081 upon the head, 7218 that ran down 3381-6 upon the beard, 2206 [even] Aaron's 175 beard: 2206 that went down 3381-6 to the skirts 6310 of his garments; 4060

133:3 As the dew 2919 of Hermon, 2768 [and as the dew] that descended 3381-6 upon the mountains 2042 of Zion: 6726 for there the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 the blessing, 1293 [even] life 2416 for evermore. 5769

134:1 <A Song 7892 of degrees.> 4609 Behold, bless 1288-16 ye the LORD, 3068 all [ye] servants 5650 of the LORD, 3068 which by night 3915 stand 5975-6 in the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

134:2 Lift up 5375-3 your hands 3027 [in] the sanctuary, 6944 and bless 1288-16 the LORD. 3068

134:3 The LORD 3068 that made 6213-6 heaven 8064 and earth 776 bless 1288-17 thee out of Zion. 6726

135:1 Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD. 3050 Praise 1984-16 ye the name 8034 of the LORD; 3068 praise 1984-16 [him], O ye servants 5650 of the LORD. 3068

135:2 Ye that stand 5975-6 in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 in the courts 2691 of the house 1004 of our God, 430

135:3 Praise 1984-16 the LORD; 3050 for the LORD 3068 [is] good: 2896 sing praises 2167-16 unto his name; 8034 for [it is] pleasant. 5273

135:4 For the LORD 3050 hath chosen 977-1 Jacob 3290 unto himself, [and] Israel 3478 for his peculiar treasure. 5459

135:5 For I know 3045-1 that the LORD 3068 [is] great, 1419 and [that] our Lord 113 [is] above all gods. 430

135:6 Whatsoever the LORD 3068 pleased, 2654-1 [that] did 6213-1 he in heaven, 8064 and in earth, 776 in the seas, 3220 and all deep places. 8415

135:7 He causeth the vapours 5387 to ascend 5927-56 from the ends 7097 of the earth; 776 he maketh 6213-1 lightnings 1300 for the rain; 4306 he bringeth the wind 7307 out 3318-56 of his treasuries. 214

135:8 Who smote 5221-52 the firstborn 1060 of Egypt, 4714 both of man 120 and beast. 929

135:9 [Who] sent 7971-1 tokens 226 and wonders 4159 into the midst 8432 of thee, O Egypt, 4714 upon Pharaoh, 6547 and upon all his servants. 5650

135:10 Who smote 5221-52 great 7227 nations, 1471 and slew 2026-1 mighty 6099 kings; 4428

135:11 Sihon 5511 king 4428 of the Amorites, 567 and Og 5747 king 4428 of Bashan, 1316 and all the kingdoms 4467 of Canaan: 3667

135:12 And gave 5414-1 their land 776 [for] an heritage, 5159 an heritage 5159 unto Israel 3478 his people. 5971

135:13 Thy name, 8034 O LORD, 3068 [endureth] for ever; 5769 [and] thy memorial, 2143 O LORD, 3068 throughout all 1755 generations. 1755

135:14 For the LORD 3068 will judge 1777-4 his people, 5971 and he will repent 5162-101 himself concerning his servants. 5650

135:15 The idols 6091 of the heathen 1471 [are] silver 3701 and gold, 2091 the work 4639 of men's 120 hands. 3027

135:16 They have mouths, 6310 but they speak 1696-17 not; eyes 5869 have they, but they see 7200-4 not;

135:17 They have ears, 241 but they hear 238-55 not; neither is there 3426 [any] breath 7307 in their mouths. 6310

135:18 They that make 6213-6 them are like unto them: [so is] every one that trusteth 982-6 in them.

135:19 Bless 1288-16 the LORD, 3068 O house 1004 of Israel: 3478 bless 1288-16 the LORD, 3068 O house 1004 of Aaron: 175

135:20 Bless 1288-16 the LORD, 3068 O house 1004 of Levi: 3878 ye that fear 3373 the LORD, 3068 bless 1288-16 the LORD. 3068

135:21 Blessed 1288-7 be the LORD 3068 out of Zion, 6726 which dwelleth 7931-6 at Jerusalem. 3389 Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD. 3050

136:1 O give thanks 3034-54 unto the LORD; 3068 for [he is] good: 2896 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

136:2 O give thanks 3034-54 unto the God 430 of gods: 430 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

136:3 O give thanks 3034-54 to the Lord 113 of lords: 113 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

136:4 To him who alone doeth 6213-6 great 1419 wonders: 6381-12 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

136:5 To him that by wisdom 8394 made 6213-6 the heavens: 8064 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

136:6 To him that stretched out 7554-6 the earth 776 above the waters: 4325 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

136:7 To him that made 6213-6 great 1419 lights: 216 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever: 5769

136:8 The sun 8121 to rule 4475 by day: 3117 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever: 5769

136:9 The moon 3394 and stars 3556 to rule 4475 by night: 3915 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

136:10 To him that smote 5221-56 Egypt 4714 in their firstborn: 1060 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever: 5769

136:11 And brought out 3318-55 Israel 3478 from among 8432 them: for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever: 5769

136:12 With a strong 2389 hand, 3027 and with a stretched out 5186-7 arm: 2220 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

136:13 To him which divided 1504-6 the Red 5488 sea 3220 into parts: 1506 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever: 5769

136:14 And made Israel 3478 to pass 5674-52 through the midst 8432 of it: for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever: 5769

136:15 But overthrew 5287-14 Pharaoh 6547 and his host 2428 in the Red 5488 sea: 3220 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

136:16 To him which led 3212-56 his people 5971 through the wilderness: 4057 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

136:17 To him which smote 5221-56 great 1419 kings: 4428 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever: 5769

136:18 And slew 2026-4 famous 117 kings: 4428 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever: 5769

136:19 Sihon 5511 king 4428 of the Amorites: 567 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever: 5769

136:20 And Og 5747 the king 4428 of Bashan: 1316 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever: 5769

136:21 And gave 5414-1 their land 776 for an heritage: 5159 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever: 5769

136:22 [Even] an heritage 5159 unto Israel 3478 his servant: 5650 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

136:23 Who remembered 2142-1 us in our low estate: 8216 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever: 5769

136:24 And hath redeemed 6561-4 us from our enemies: 6862 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

136:25 Who giveth 5414-6 food 3899 to all flesh: 1320 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

136:26 O give thanks 3034-54 unto the God 410 of heaven: 8064 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

137:1 By the rivers 5104 of Babylon, 894 there we sat down, 3427-1 yea, we wept, 1058-1 when we remembered 2142-2 Zion. 6726

137:2 We hanged 8518-1 our harps 3658 upon the willows 6155 in the midst 8432 thereof.

137:3 For there they that carried us away captive 7617-6 required 7592-1 of us a song; 1697 7892 and they that wasted 8437 us [required of us] mirth, 8057 [saying], Sing 7891-3 us [one] of the songs 7892 of Zion. 6726

137:4 How shall we sing 7891-4 the LORD'S 3068 song 7892 in a strange 5236 land? 127

137:5 If I forget 7911-4 thee, O Jerusalem, 3389 let my right hand 3225 forget 7911-4 [her cunning].

137:6 If I do not remember 2142-4 thee, let my tongue 3956 cleave 1692-4 to the roof of my mouth; 2441 if I prefer 5927-55 not Jerusalem 3389 above my chief 7218 joy. 8057

137:7 Remember, 2142-3 O LORD, 3068 the children 1121 of Edom 123 in the day 3117 of Jerusalem; 3389 who said, 559-6 Rase 6168-16 [it], rase 6168-16 [it, even] to the foundation 3247 thereof.

137:8 O daughter 1323 of Babylon, 894 who art to be destroyed; 7703-7 happy 835 [shall he be], that rewardeth 7999-17 thee as thou hast served 1580-1 1576 us.

137:9 Happy 835 [shall he be], that taketh 270-4 and dasheth 5310-14 thy little ones 5768 against the stones. 5553

138:1 <[A Psalm] of David.> 1732 I will praise 3034-55 thee with my whole heart: 3820 before the gods 430 will I sing praise 2167-17 unto thee.

138:2 I will worship 7812-101 toward thy holy 6944 temple, 1964 and praise 3034-55 thy name 8034 for thy lovingkindness 2617 and for thy truth: 571 for thou hast magnified 1431-52 thy word 565 above all thy name. 8034

138:3 In the day 3117 when I cried 7121-1 thou answeredst 6030-4 me, [and] strengthenedst 7292-55 me [with] strength 5797 in my soul. 5315

138:4 All the kings 4428 of the earth 776 shall praise 3034-55 thee, O LORD, 3068 when they hear 8085-1 the words 561 of thy mouth. 6310

138:5 Yea, they shall sing 7891-4 in the ways 1870 of the LORD: 3068 for great 1419 [is] the glory 3519 of the LORD. 3068

138:6 Though the LORD 3068 [be] high, 7311-6 yet hath he respect 7200-4 unto the lowly: 8217 but the proud 1364 he knoweth 3045-4 afar off. 4801

138:7 Though I walk 3212-4 in the midst 7130 of trouble, 6869 thou wilt revive 2421-17 me: thou shalt stretch forth 7971-4 thine hand 3027 against the wrath 639 of mine enemies, 341-6 and thy right hand 3225 shall save 3467-55 me.

138:8 The LORD 3068 will perfect 1584-4 [that which] concerneth me: thy mercy, 2617 O LORD, 3068 [endureth] for ever: 5769 forsake 7503-55 not the works 4639 of thine own hands. 3027

139:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 O LORD, 3068 thou hast searched 2713-1 me, and known 3045-4 [me].

139:2 Thou knowest 3045-1 my downsitting 3427-2 and mine uprising, 6965-2 thou understandest 995-1 my thought 7454 afar off. 7350

139:3 Thou compassest 2219-14 my path 734 and my lying down, 7252 and art acquainted 5532-52 [with] all my ways. 1870

139:4 For [there is] not a word 4405 in my tongue, 3956 [but], lo, O LORD, 3068 thou knowest 3045-1 it altogether.

139:5 Thou hast beset 6696-1 me behind 268 and before, 6924 and laid 7896-4 thine hand 3709 upon me.

139:6 [Such] knowledge 1847 [is] too wonderful 6383|6383-k for me; it is high, 7682-8 I cannot 3808 3201-4 [attain] unto it.

139:7 Whither shall I go 3212-4 from thy spirit? 7307 or whither shall I flee 1272-4 from thy presence? 6440

139:8 If I ascend up 5266-4 into heaven, 8064 thou [art] there: if I make my bed 3331-55 in hell, 7585 behold, thou [art there].

139:9 [If] I take 5375-4 the wings 3671 of the morning, 7837 [and] dwell 7931-4 in the uttermost parts 319 of the sea; 3220

139:10 Even there shall thy hand 3027 lead 5148-55 me, and thy right hand 3225 shall hold me. 270-4

139:11 If I say, 559-4 Surely the darkness 2822 shall cover 7779-4 me; even the night 3915 shall be light 216 about me. 1157

139:12 Yea, the darkness 2822 hideth 2821-55 not from thee; but the night 3915 shineth 215-55 as the day: 3117 the darkness 2825 and the light 219 [are] both alike [to thee].

139:13 For thou hast possessed 7069-1 my reins: 3629 thou hast covered 5526-4 me in my mother's 517 womb. 990

139:14 I will praise 3034-55 thee; for I am fearfully 3372-12 [and] wonderfully made: 6395-8 marvellous 6381-12 [are] thy works; 4639 and [that] my soul 5315 knoweth 3045-6 right well. 3966

139:15 My substance 6108 was not hid 3582-8 from thee, when I was made 6213-27 in secret, 5643 [and] curiously wrought 7551-27 in the lowest parts 8482 of the earth. 776

139:16 Thine eyes 5869 did see 7200-1 my substance, yet being unperfect; 1564 and in thy book 5612 all 3605 [my members] were written, 3789-11 [which] in continuance 3117 were fashioned, 3335-27 when [as yet there was] none 259 of them.

139:17 How precious 3365-1 also are thy thoughts 7454 unto me, O God! 410 how great 6105-1 is the sum 7218 of them!

139:18 [If] I should count 5608-4 them, they are more in number 7235-4 than the sand: 2344 when I awake, 6974-52 I am still 5750 with thee.

139:19 Surely thou wilt slay 6991-4 the wicked, 7563 O God: 433 depart 5493-3 from me therefore, ye bloody 1818 men. 582

139:20 For they speak 559-4 against thee wickedly, 4209 [and] thine enemies 6145 take 5375-1 [thy name] in vain. 7723

139:21 Do not I hate 8130-4 them, O LORD, 3068 that hate 8130-18 thee? and am not I grieved 6962-113 with those that rise up against 8618 thee?

139:22 I hate 8130-1 them with perfect 8503 hatred: 8135 I count them mine enemies. 341-6

139:23 Search 2713-3 me, O God, 410 and know 3045-3 my heart: 3824 try 974-3 me, and know 3045-3 my thoughts: 8312

139:24 And see 7200-3 if [there be any] wicked 6090 way 1870 in me, and lead 5148-3 me in the way 1870 everlasting. 5769

140:1 <To the chief Musician, 5329-18 A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 Deliver 2502-16 me, O LORD, 3068 from the evil 7451 man: 120 preserve 5341-4 me from the violent 2555 man; 376

140:2 Which imagine 2803-1 mischiefs 7451 in [their] heart; 3820 continually 3605 3117 are they gathered 1481-4 together [for] war. 4421

140:3 They have sharpened 8150-1 their tongues 3956 like a serpent; 5175 adders' 5919 poison 2534 [is] under their lips. 8193 Selah. 5542

140:4 Keep 8104-3 me, O LORD, 3068 from the hands 3027 of the wicked; 7563 preserve 5341-4 me from the violent 2555 man; 376 who have purposed 2803-1 to overthrow 1760-2 my goings. 6471

140:5 The proud 1343 have hid 2934-1 a snare 6341 for me, and cords; 2256 they have spread 6566-1 a net 7568 by the wayside; 3027 4570 they have set 7896-1 gins 4170 for me. Selah. 5542

140:6 I said 559-1 unto the LORD, 3068 Thou [art] my God: 410 hear 238-54 the voice 6963 of my supplications, 8469 O LORD. 3068

140:7 O GOD 3069 the Lord, 136 the strength 5797 of my salvation, 3444 thou hast covered 5526-1 my head 7218 in the day 3117 of battle. 5402

140:8 Grant 5414-4 not, O LORD, 3068 the desires 3970 of the wicked: 7563 further 6329-55 not his wicked device; 2162 [lest] they exalt 7311-4 themselves. Selah. 5542

140:9 [As for] the head 7218 of those that compass me about, 4524 let the mischief 5999 of their own lips 8193 cover 3680-17 them.

140:10 Let burning coals 1513 fall 4131-11|4131-55-k upon them: let them be cast 5307-55 into the fire; 784 into deep pits, 4113 that they rise not up 6965-4 again.

140:11 Let not an evil speaker 376 3956 be established 3559-11 in the earth: 776 evil 7451 shall hunt 6679-4 the violent 2555 man 376 to overthrow 4073 [him].

140:12 I know 3045-1 that the LORD 3068 will maintain 6213-4 the cause 1779 of the afflicted, 6041 [and] the right 4941 of the poor. 34

140:13 Surely the righteous 6662 shall give thanks 3034-55 unto thy name: 8034 the upright 3477 shall dwell 3427-4 in thy presence. 6440

141:1 <A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 LORD, 3068 I cry 7121-1 unto thee: make haste 2363-3 unto me; give ear 238-54 unto my voice, 6963 when I cry 7121-2 unto thee.

141:2 Let my prayer 8605 be set forth 3559-11 before 6440 thee [as] incense; 7004 [and] the lifting up 4864 of my hands 3709 [as] the evening 6153 sacrifice. 4503

141:3 Set 7896-3 a watch, 8108 O LORD, 3068 before my mouth; 6310 keep 5341-3 the door 1817 of my lips. 8193

141:4 Incline 5186-55 not my heart 3820 to [any] evil 7451 thing, 1697 to practise 5953-106 wicked 7562 works 5949 with men 376 that work 6466-6 iniquity: 205 and let me not eat 3898-4 of their dainties. 4516

141:5 Let the righteous 6662 smite 1986-4 me; [it shall be] a kindness: 2617 and let him reprove 3198-55 me; [it shall be] an excellent 7218 oil, 8081 [which] shall not break 5106-55 my head: 7218 for yet my prayer 8605 also [shall be] in their calamities. 7451

141:6 When their judges 8199-6 are overthrown 8058-8 in stony 5553 places, 3027 they shall hear 8085-1 my words; 561 for they are sweet. 5276-1

141:7 Our bones 6106 are scattered 6340-8 at the grave's 7585 mouth, 6310 as when one cutteth 6398-6 and cleaveth 1234-6 [wood] upon the earth. 776

141:8 But mine eyes 5869 [are] unto thee, O GOD 3069 the Lord: 136 in thee is my trust; 2620-1 leave not my soul 5315 destitute. 6168-17

141:9 Keep 8104-3 me from 3027 the snares 6341 [which] they have laid 3369-1 for me, and the gins 4170 of the workers 6466-6 of iniquity. 205

141:10 Let the wicked 7563 fall 5307-4 into their own nets, 4364 whilst that I withal 3162 escape. 5674-4

142:1 <Maschil 4905|7919-56 of David; 1732 A Prayer 8605 when he was in the cave.> 4631 I cried 2199-4 unto the LORD 3068 with my voice; 6963 with my voice 6963 unto the LORD 3068 did I make my supplication. 2603-101

142:2 I poured out 8210-4 my complaint 7879 before 6440 him; I shewed 5046-55 before 6440 him my trouble. 6869

142:3 When my spirit 7307 was overwhelmed 5848-99 within me, then thou knewest 3045-1 my path. 5410 In the way 734 wherein 2098 I walked 1980-17 have they privily laid 2934-1 a snare 6341 for me.

142:4 I looked 5027-54 on [my] right hand, 3225 and beheld, 7200-3 but [there was] no man that would know 5234-56 me: refuge 4498 failed 6-1 me; no man cared 1875-6 for my soul. 5315

142:5 I cried 2199-1 unto thee, O LORD: 3068 I said, 559-1 Thou [art] my refuge 4268 [and] my portion 2506 in the land 776 of the living. 2416

142:6 Attend 7181-54 unto my cry; 7440 for I am brought very 3966 low: 1809-1 deliver 5337-54 me from my persecutors; 7291-6 for they are stronger 553-1 than I.

142:7 Bring my soul 5315 out 3318-54 of prison, 4525 that I may praise 3034-53 thy name: 8034 the righteous 6662 shall compass me about; 3803-55 for thou shalt deal bountifully 1580-4 with me.

143:1 <A Psalm 4210 of David.> 1732 Hear 8085-3 my prayer, 8605 O LORD, 3068 give ear 238-54 to my supplications: 8469 in thy faithfulness 530 answer 6030-3 me, [and] in thy righteousness. 6666

143:2 And enter 935-4 not into judgment 4941 with thy servant: 5650 for in thy sight 6440 shall no man living 2416 be justified. 6663-4

143:3 For the enemy 341-6 hath persecuted 7291-1 my soul; 5315 he hath smitten 1792-14 my life 2416 down to the ground; 776 he hath made me to dwell 3427-52 in darkness, 4285 as those that have been long 5769 dead. 4191-5

143:4 Therefore is my spirit 7307 overwhelmed 5848-101 within me; my heart 3820 within 8432 me is desolate. 8074-113

143:5 I remember 2142-1 the days 3117 of old; 6924 I meditate 1897-1 on all thy works; 6467 I muse 7878-34 on the work 4639 of thy hands. 3027

143:6 I stretch forth 6566-14 my hands 3027 unto thee: my soul 5315 [thirsteth] after thee, as a thirsty 5889 land. 776 Selah. 5542

143:7 Hear 6030-3 me speedily, 4118 O LORD: 3068 my spirit 7307 faileth: 3615-1 hide 5641-55 not thy face 6440 from me, lest I be like 4911-8 unto them that go down 3381-6 into the pit. 953

143:8 Cause me to hear 8085-54 thy lovingkindness 2617 in the morning; 1242 for in thee do I trust: 982-1 cause me to know 3045-54 the way 1870 wherein 2098 I should walk; 3212-4 for I lift up 5375-1 my soul 5315 unto thee.

143:9 Deliver 5337-54 me, O LORD, 3068 from mine enemies: 341-6 I flee unto thee to hide 3680-14 me.

143:10 Teach 3925-16 me to do 6213-2 thy will; 7522 for thou [art] my God: 430 thy spirit 7307 [is] good; 2896 lead 5148-55 me into the land 776 of uprightness. 4334

143:11 Quicken 2421-17 me, O LORD, 3068 for thy name's 8034 sake: for thy righteousness' 6666 sake bring my soul 5315 out 3318-55 of trouble. 6869

143:12 And of thy mercy 2617 cut off 6789-55 mine enemies, 341-6 and destroy 6-52 all them that afflict 6887-6 my soul: 5315 for I [am] thy servant. 5650

144:1 <[A Psalm] of David.> 1732 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD 3068 my strength, 6697 which teacheth 3925-18 my hands 3027 to war, 7128 [and] my fingers 676 to fight: 4421

144:2 My goodness, 2617 and my fortress; 4686 my high tower, 4869 and my deliverer; 6403-18 my shield, 4043 and [he] in whom I trust; 2620-1 who subdueth 7286-6 my people 5971 under me.

144:3 LORD, 3068 what [is] man, 120 that thou takest knowledge 3045-4 of him! [or] the son 1121 of man, 582 that thou makest account 2803-17 of him!

144:4 Man 120 is like 1819-1 to vanity: 1892 his days 3117 [are] as a shadow 6738 that passeth away. 5674-6

144:5 Bow 5186-54 thy heavens, 8064 O LORD, 3068 and come down: 3381-4 touch 5060-3 the mountains, 2022 and they shall smoke. 6225-4

144:6 Cast forth 1299-3 lightning, 1300 and scatter 6327-55 them: shoot out 7971-3 thine arrows, 2671 and destroy 2000-4 them.

144:7 Send 7971-3 thine hand 3027 from above; 4791 rid 6475-3 me, and deliver 5337-54 me out of great 7227 waters, 4325 from the hand 3027 of strange 5236 children; 1121

144:8 Whose mouth 6310 speaketh 1696-14 vanity, 7723 and their right hand 3225 [is] a right hand 3225 of falsehood. 8267

144:9 I will sing 7891-4 a new 2319 song 7892 unto thee, O God: 430 upon a psaltery 5035 [and] an instrument of ten 6218 strings will I sing praises 2167-17 unto thee.

144:10 [It is he] that giveth 5414-6 salvation 8668 unto kings: 4428 who delivereth 6475-6 David 1732 his servant 5650 from the hurtful 7451 sword. 2719

144:11 Rid 6475-3 me, and deliver 5337-54 me from the hand 3027 of strange 5236 children, 1121 whose mouth 6310 speaketh 1696-14 vanity, 7723 and their right hand 3225 [is] a right hand 3225 of falsehood: 8267

144:12 That our sons 1121 [may be] as plants 5195 grown up 1431-30 in their youth; 5271 [that] our daughters 1323 [may be] as corner stones, 2106 polished 2404-30 [after] the similitude 8403 of a palace: 1964

144:13 [That] our garners 4200 [may be] full, 4392 affording 6329-56 all manner of store: 2177 2177 [that] our sheep 6629 may bring forth thousands 503-56 and ten thousands 7231-30 in our streets: 2351

144:14 [That] our oxen 441 [may be] strong to labour; 5445-30 [that there be] no breaking in, 6556 nor going out; 3318-6 that [there be] no complaining 6682 in our streets. 7339

144:15 Happy 835 [is that] people, 5971 that is in such a case: 3602 [yea], happy 835 [is that] people, 5971 whose God 430 [is] the LORD. 3068

145:1 <David's 1732 [Psalm] of praise.> 8416 I will extol 7311-34 thee, my God, 430 O king; 4428 and I will bless 1288-17 thy name 8034 for ever 5769 and ever. 5703

145:2 Every day 3117 will I bless 1288-17 thee; and I will praise 1984-17 thy name 8034 for ever 5769 and ever. 5703

145:3 Great 1419 [is] the LORD, 3068 and greatly 3966 to be praised; 1984-30 and his greatness 1420 [is] unsearchable. 369 2714

145:4 One generation 1755 shall praise 7623-17 thy works 4639 to another, 1755 and shall declare 5046-55 thy mighty acts. 1369

145:5 I will speak 7878-4 of the glorious 3519 honour 1926 of thy majesty, 1935 and of thy wondrous 6381-12 works. 1697

145:6 And [men] shall speak 559-4 of the might 5807 of thy terrible acts: 3372-12 and I will declare 5608-17 thy greatness. 1420

145:7 They shall abundantly utter 5042-55 the memory 2143 of thy great 7227 goodness, 2898 and shall sing 7442-17 of thy righteousness. 6666

145:8 The LORD 3068 [is] gracious, 2587 and full of compassion; 7349 slow 750 to anger, 639 and of great 1419 mercy. 2617

145:9 The LORD 3068 [is] good 2896 to all: and his tender mercies 7356 [are] over all his works. 4639

145:10 All thy works 4639 shall praise 3034-55 thee, O LORD; 3068 and thy saints 2623 shall bless 1288-17 thee.

145:11 They shall speak 559-4 of the glory 3519 of thy kingdom, 4438 and talk 1696-17 of thy power; 1369

145:12 To make known 3045-53 to the sons 1121 of men 120 his mighty acts, 1369 and the glorious 3519 majesty 1926 of his kingdom. 4438

145:13 Thy kingdom 4438 [is] an everlasting 5769 kingdom, 4438 and thy dominion 4475 [endureth] throughout all generations. 1755 1755

145:14 The LORD 3068 upholdeth 5564-6 all that fall, 5307-6 and raiseth up 2210-6 all [those that be] bowed down. 3721-7

145:15 The eyes 5869 of all wait 7663-17 upon thee; and thou givest 5414-6 them their meat 400 in due season. 6256

145:16 Thou openest 6605-6 thine hand, 3027 and satisfiest 7646-56 the desire 7522 of every living thing. 2416

145:17 The LORD 3068 [is] righteous 6662 in all his ways, 1870 and holy 2623 in all his works. 4639

145:18 The LORD 3068 [is] nigh 7138 unto all them that call 7121-6 upon him, to all that call 7121-4 upon him in truth. 571

145:19 He will fulfil 6213-4 the desire 7522 of them that fear 3373 him: he also will hear 8085-4 their cry, 7775 and will save 3467-55 them.

145:20 The LORD 3068 preserveth 8104-6 all them that love 157-6 him: but all the wicked 7563 will he destroy. 8045-55

145:21 My mouth 6310 shall speak 1696-17 the praise 8416 of the LORD: 3068 and let all flesh 1320 bless 1288-17 his holy 6944 name 8034 for ever 5769 and ever. 5703

146:1 Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD. 3050 Praise 1984-16 the LORD, 3068 O my soul. 5315

146:2 While I live 2416 will I praise 1984-17 the LORD: 3068 I will sing praises 2167-17 unto my God 430 while I have any being.

146:3 Put not your trust 982-4 in princes, 5081 [nor] in the son 1121 of man, 120 in whom [there is] no help. 8668

146:4 His breath 7307 goeth forth, 3318-4 he returneth 7725-4 to his earth; 127 in that very day 3117 his thoughts 6250 perish. 6-1

146:5 Happy 835 [is he] that [hath] the God 410 of Jacob 3290 for his help, 5828 whose hope 7664 [is] in the LORD 3068 his God: 430

146:6 Which made 6213-6 heaven, 8064 and earth, 776 the sea, 3220 and all that therein [is]: which keepeth 8104-6 truth 571 for ever: 5769

146:7 Which executeth 6213-6 judgment 4941 for the oppressed: 6231-7 which giveth 5414-6 food 3899 to the hungry. 7457 The LORD 3068 looseth 5425-56 the prisoners: 631-7

146:8 The LORD 3068 openeth 6491-6 [the eyes of] the blind: 5787 the LORD 3068 raiseth 2210-6 them that are bowed down: 3721-7 the LORD 3068 loveth 157-6 the righteous: 6662

146:9 The LORD 3068 preserveth 8104-6 the strangers; 1616 he relieveth 5749-41 the fatherless 3490 and widow: 490 but the way 1870 of the wicked 7563 he turneth upside down. 5791-17

146:10 The LORD 3068 shall reign 4427-4 for ever, 5769 [even] thy God, 430 O Zion, 6726 unto all 1755 generations. 1755 Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD. 3050

147:1 Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD: 3050 for [it is] good 2896 to sing praises 2167-15 unto our God; 430 for [it is] pleasant; 5273 [and] praise 8416 is comely. 5000

147:2 The LORD 3068 doth build up 1129-6 Jerusalem: 3389 he gathereth together 3664-17 the outcasts 1760-12 of Israel. 3478

147:3 He healeth 7495-6 the broken 7665-7 in heart, 3820 and bindeth up 2280-18 their wounds. 6094

147:4 He telleth 4487-6 the number 4557 of the stars; 3556 he calleth 7121-4 them all by [their] names. 8034

147:5 Great 1419 [is] our Lord, 113 and of great 7227 power: 3581 his understanding 8394 [is] infinite. 369 4557

147:6 The LORD 3068 lifteth up 5749-42 the meek: 6035 he casteth the wicked 7563 down 8213-56 to the ground. 776

147:7 Sing 6030-3 unto the LORD 3068 with thanksgiving; 8426 sing praise 2167-16 upon the harp 3658 unto our God: 430

147:8 Who covereth 3680-18 the heaven 8064 with clouds, 5645 who prepareth 3559-56 rain 4306 for the earth, 776 who maketh grass 2682 to grow 6779-56 upon the mountains. 2022

147:9 He giveth 5414-6 to the beast 929 his food, 3899 [and] to the young 1121 ravens 6158 which cry. 7121-4

147:10 He delighteth 2654-4 not in the strength 1369 of the horse: 5483 he taketh not pleasure 7521-4 in the legs 7785 of a man. 376

147:11 The LORD 3068 taketh pleasure 7521-6 in them that fear 3373 him, in those that hope 3176-18 in his mercy. 2617

147:12 Praise 7623-16 the LORD, 3068 O Jerusalem; 3389 praise 1984-16 thy God, 430 O Zion. 6726

147:13 For he hath strengthened 2388-14 the bars 1280 of thy gates; 8179 he hath blessed 1288-14 thy children 1121 within 7130 thee.

147:14 He maketh 7760-6 peace 7965 [in] thy borders, 1366 [and] filleth 7646-55 thee with the finest 2459 of the wheat. 2406

147:15 He sendeth forth 7971-6 his commandment 565 [upon] earth: 776 his word 1697 runneth 7323-4 very swiftly. 4120

147:16 He giveth 5414-6 snow 7950 like wool: 6785 he scattereth 6340-17 the hoarfrost 3713 like ashes. 665

147:17 He casteth forth 7993-56 his ice 7140 like morsels: 6595 who can stand 5975-4 before 6440 his cold? 7135

147:18 He sendeth out 7971-4 his word, 1697 and melteth 4529-55 them: he causeth his wind 7307 to blow, 5380-55 [and] the waters 4325 flow. 5140-4

147:19 He sheweth 5046-56 his word 1697|1697-k unto Jacob, 3290 his statutes 2706 and his judgments 4941 unto Israel. 3478

147:20 He hath not dealt 6213-1 so with any nation: 1471 and [as for his] judgments, 4941 they have not known 3045-1 them. Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD. 3050

148:1 Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD. 3050 Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD 3068 from the heavens: 8064 praise 1984-16 him in the heights. 4791

148:5 Let them praise 1984-17 the name 8034 of the LORD: 3068 for he commanded, 6680-14 and they were created. 1254-8

148:6 He hath also stablished 5975-55 them for ever 5703 and ever: 5769 he hath made 5414-1 a decree 2706 which shall not pass. 5674-4

148:7 Praise 1984-16 the LORD 3068 from the earth, 776 ye dragons, 8577 and all deeps: 8415

148:13 Let them praise 1984-17 the name 8034 of the LORD: 3068 for his name 8034 alone is excellent; 7682-12 his glory 1935 [is] above the earth 776 and heaven. 8064

148:14 He also exalteth 7311-55 the horn 7161 of his people, 5971 the praise 8416 of all his saints; 2623 [even] of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 a people 5971 near 7138 unto him. Praise 1984-16 ye the LORD. 3050
