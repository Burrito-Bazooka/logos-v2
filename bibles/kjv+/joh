1:1 In 1722 the beginning 746 was 2258 5713 the Word 3056, and 2532 the Word 3056 was 2258 5713 with 4314 God 2316, and 2532 the Word 3056 was 2258 5713 God 2316. 

1:2 The same 3778 was 2258 5713 in 1722 the beginning 746 with 4314 God 2316. 

1:3 All things 3956 were made 1096 5633 by 1223 him 846; and 2532 without 5565 him 846 was 1096 0 not 3761 any thing 1520 made 1096 5633 that was made 1096 5754. 

1:4 In 1722 him 846 was 2258 5713 life 2222; and 2532 the life 2222 was 2258 5713 the light 5457 of men 444. 

1:5 And 2532 the light 5457 shineth 5316 5719 in 1722 darkness 4653; and 2532 the darkness 4653 comprehended 2638 5627 it 846 not 3756. 

1:6 There was 1096 5633 a man 444 sent 649 5772 from 3844 God 2316, whose 846 name 3686 [was] John 2491. 

1:7 The same 3778 came 2064 5627 for 1519 a witness 3141, to 2443 bear witness 3140 5661 of 4012 the Light 5457, that 2443 all 3956 [men] through 1223 him 846 might believe 4100 5661. 

1:8 He was 2258 5713 not 3756 that 1565 Light 5457, but 235 [was sent] to 2443 bear witness 3140 5661 of 4012 that Light 5457. 

1:9 [That] was 2258 5713 the true 228 Light 5457, which 3739 lighteth 5461 5719 every man 3956 444 that cometh 2064 5740 into 1519 the world 2889. 

1:10 He was 2258 5713 in 1722 the world 2889, and 2532 the world 2889 was made 1096 5633 by 1223 him 846, and 2532 the world 2889 knew 1097 5627 him 846 not 3756. 

1:11 He came 2064 5627 unto 1519 his own 2398, and 2532 his own 2398 received 3880 5627 him 846 not 3756. 

1:12 But 1161 as many as 3745 received 2983 5627 him 846, to them 846 gave he 1325 5656 power 1849 to become 1096 5635 the sons 5043 of God 2316, [even] to them that believe 4100 5723 on 1519 his 846 name 3686: 

1:13 Which 3739 were born 1080 5681, not 3756 of 1537 blood 129, nor 3761 of 1537 the will 2307 of the flesh 4561, nor 3761 of 1537 the will 2307 of man 435, but 235 of 1537 God 2316. 

1:14 And 2532 the Word 3056 was made 1096 5633 flesh 4561, and 2532 dwelt 4637 5656 among 1722 us 2254, (and 2532 we beheld 2300 5662 his 846 glory 1391, the glory 1391 as 5613 of the only begotten 3439 of 3844 the Father 3962) full 4134 of grace 5485 and 2532 truth 225. 

1:15 John 2491 bare witness 3140 5719 of 4012 him 846, and 2532 cried 2896 5754, saying 3004 5723, This 3778 was he 2258 5713 of whom 3739 I spake 2036 5627, He that cometh 2064 5740 after 3694 me 3450 is preferred 1096 5754 before 1715 me 3450: for 3754 he was 2258 5713 before 4413 me 3450. 

1:16 And 2532 of 1537 his 846 fulness 4138 have 2983 0 all 3956 we 2249 received 2983 5627, and 2532 grace 5485 for 473 grace 5485. 

1:17 For 3754 the law 3551 was given 1325 5681 by 1223 Moses 3475, [but] grace 5485 and 2532 truth 225 came 1096 5633 by 1223 Jesus 2424 Christ 5547. 

1:18 No man 3762 hath seen 3708 5758 God 2316 at any time 4455; the only begotten 3439 Son 5207, which 3588 is 5607 5752 in 1519 the bosom 2859 of the Father 3962, he 1565 hath declared 1834 5662 [him]. 

1:19 And 2532 this 3778 is 2076 5748 the record 3141 of John 2491, when 3753 the Jews 2453 sent 649 5656 priests 2409 and 2532 Levites 3019 from 1537 Jerusalem 2414 to 2443 ask 2065 5661 him 846, Who 5101 art 1488 5748 thou 4771? 

1:20 And 2532 he confessed 3670 5656, and 2532 denied 720 5662 not 3756; but 2532 confessed 3670 5656, 3754 I 1473 am 1510 5748 not 3756 the Christ 5547. 

1:21 And 2532 they asked 2065 5656 him 846, What 5101 then 3767? Art 1488 5748 thou 4771 Elias 2243? And 2532 he saith 3004 5719, I am 1510 5748 not 3756. Art 1488 5748 thou 4771 that prophet 4396? And 2532 he answered 611 5662, No 3756. 

1:22 Then 3767 said they 2036 5627 unto him 846, Who 5101 art thou 1488 5748? that 2443 we may give 1325 5632 an answer 612 to them that sent 3992 5660 us 2248. What 5101 sayest thou 3004 5719 of 4012 thyself 4572? 

1:23 He said 5346 5713, I 1473 [am] the voice 5456 of one crying 994 5723 in 1722 the wilderness 2048, Make straight 2116 5657 the way 3598 of the Lord 2962, as 2531 said 2036 5627 the prophet 4396 Esaias 2268. 

1:24 And 2532 they which 3588 were sent 649 5772 were 2258 5713 of 1537 the Pharisees 5330. 

1:25 And 2532 they asked 2065 5656 him 846, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Why 5101 baptizest thou 907 5719 then 3767, if 1487 thou 4771 be 1488 5748 not 3756 that Christ 5547, nor 3777 Elias 2243, neither 3777 that prophet 4396? 

1:26 John 2491 answered 611 5662 them 846, saying 3004 5723, I 1473 baptize 907 5719 with 1722 water 5204: but 1161 there standeth one 2476 5758 among 3319 you 5216, whom 3739 ye 5210 know 1492 5758 not 3756; 

1:27 He 846 it is 2076 5748, who 3739 coming 2064 5740 after 3694 me 3450 is preferred 1096 5754 before 1715 me 3450, whose 3739 846 shoe's 5266 latchet 2438 I 1473 am 1510 5748 not 3756 worthy 514 to 2443 unloose 3089 5661. 

1:28 These things 5023 were done 1096 5633 in 1722 Bethabara 962 beyond 4008 Jordan 2446, where 3699 John 2491 was 2258 5713 baptizing 907 5723. 

1:29 The next day 1887 John 2491 seeth 991 5719 Jesus 2424 coming 2064 5740 unto 4314 him 846, and 2532 saith 3004 5719, Behold 2396 the Lamb 286 of God 2316, which 3588 taketh away 142 5723 the sin 266 of the world 2889. 

1:30 This 3778 is he 2076 5748 of 4012 whom 3739 I 1473 said 2036 5627, After 3694 me 3450 cometh 2064 5736 a man 435 which 3739 is preferred 1096 5754 before 1715 me 3450: for 3754 he was 2258 5713 before 4413 me 3450. 

1:31 And I 2504 knew 1492 5715 him 846 not 3756: but 235 that 2443 he should be made manifest 5319 5686 to Israel 2474, therefore 1223 5124 am 2064 0 I 1473 come 2064 5627 baptizing 907 5723 with 1722 water 5204. 

1:32 And 2532 John 2491 bare record 3140 5656, saying 3004 5723, 3754 I saw 2300 5766 the Spirit 4151 descending 2597 5723 from 1537 heaven 3772 like 5616 a dove 4058, and 2532 it abode 3306 5656 upon 1909 him 846. 

1:33 And I 2504 knew 1492 5715 him 846 not 3756: but 235 he that sent 3992 5660 me 3165 to baptize 907 5721 with 1722 water 5204, the same 1565 said 2036 5627 unto me 3427, Upon 1909 whom 3739 302 thou shalt see 1492 5632 the Spirit 4151 descending 2597 5723, and 2532 remaining 3306 5723 on 1909 him 846, the same 3778 is 2076 5748 he which baptizeth 907 5723 with 1722 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151. 

1:34 And I 2504 saw 3708 5758, and 2532 bare record 3140 5758 that 3754 this 3778 is 2076 5748 the Son 5207 of God 2316. 

1:35 Again 3825 the next day after 1887 John 2491 stood 2476 5715, and 2532 two 1417 of 1537 his 846 disciples 3101; 

1:36 And 2532 looking upon 1689 5660 Jesus 2424 as he walked 4043 5723, he saith 3004 5719, Behold 2396 the Lamb 286 of God 2316! 

1:37 And 2532 the two 1417 disciples 3101 heard 191 5656 him 846 speak 2980 5723, and 2532 they followed 190 5656 Jesus 2424. 

1:38 Then 1161 Jesus 2424 turned 4762 5651, and 2532 saw 2300 5666 them 846 following 190 5723, and saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, What 5101 seek ye 2212 5719? 1161 They said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Rabbi 4461, (which is to say 3004 5743, being interpreted 2059 5746, Master 1320) where 4226 dwellest thou 3306 5719? 

1:39 He saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Come 2064 5737 and 2532 see 1492 5628. They came 2064 5627 and 2532 saw 1492 5627 where 4226 he dwelt 3306 5719, and 2532 abode 3306 5656 with 3844 him 846 that 1565 day 2250: for 1161 it was 2258 5713 about 5613 the tenth 1182 hour 5610. 

1:40 One 1520 of 1537 the two 1417 which 3588 heard 191 5660 3844 John 2491 [speak], and 2532 followed 190 5660 him 846, was 2258 5713 Andrew 406, Simon 4613 Peter's 4074 brother 80. 

1:41 He 3778 first 4413 findeth 2147 5719 his own 2398 brother 80 Simon 4613, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, We have found 2147 5758 the Messias 3323, which 3739 is 2076 5748, being interpreted 3177 5746, the Christ 5547. 

1:42 And 2532 he brought 71 5627 him 846 to 4314 Jesus 2424. And 1161 when Jesus 2424 beheld 1689 5660 him 846, he said 2036 5627, Thou 4771 art 1488 5748 Simon 4613 the son 5207 of Jona 2495: thou 4771 shalt be called 2564 5701 Cephas 2786, which 3739 is by interpretation 2059 5743, A stone 4074. 

1:43 The day following 1887 Jesus 2424 would 2309 5656 go forth 1831 5629 into 1519 Galilee 1056, and 2532 findeth 2147 5719 Philip 5376, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Follow 190 5720 me 3427. 

1:44 Now 1161 Philip 5376 was 2258 5713 of 575 Bethsaida 966, the city 4172 of 1537 Andrew 406 and 2532 Peter 4074. 

1:45 Philip 5376 findeth 2147 5719 Nathanael 3482, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, We have found 2147 5758 him, of whom 3739 Moses 3475 in 1722 the law 3551, and 2532 the prophets 4396, did write 1125 5656, Jesus 2424 of 575 Nazareth 3478, the son 5207 of Joseph 2501. 

1:46 And 2532 Nathanael 3482 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Can 1410 5736 there any 5100 good thing 18 come 1511 5750 out of 1537 Nazareth 3478? Philip 5376 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Come 2064 5736 and 2532 see 1492 5657. 

1:47 Jesus 2424 saw 1492 5627 Nathanael 3482 coming 2064 5740 to 4314 him 848, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 of 4012 him 846, Behold 2396 an Israelite 2475 indeed 230, in 1722 whom 3739 is 2076 5748 no 3756 guile 1388! 

1:48 Nathanael 3482 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Whence 4159 knowest thou 1097 5719 me 3165? Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Before 4253 that Philip 5376 called 5455 5658 thee 4571, when thou wast 5607 5752 under 5259 the fig tree 4808, I saw 1492 5627 thee 4571. 

1:49 Nathanael 3482 answered 611 5662 and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Rabbi 4461, thou 4771 art 1488 5748 the Son 5207 of God 2316; thou 4771 art 1488 5748 the King 935 of Israel 2474. 

1:50 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Because 3754 I said 2036 5627 unto thee 4671, I saw 1492 5627 thee 4571 under 5270 the fig tree 4808, believest thou 4100 5719? thou shalt see 3700 5695 greater things 3187 than these 5130. 

1:51 And 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Hereafter 737 575 ye shall see 3700 5695 heaven 3772 open 455 5757, and 2532 the angels 32 of God 2316 ascending 305 5723 and 2532 descending 2597 5723 upon 1909 the Son 5207 of man 444. 

2:1 And 2532 the third 5154 day 2250 there was 1096 5633 a marriage 1062 in 1722 Cana 2580 of Galilee 1056; and 2532 the mother 3384 of Jesus 2424 was 2258 5713 there 1563: 

2:2 And 1161 both 2532 Jesus 2424 was called 2564 5681, and 2532 his 846 disciples 3101, to 1519 the marriage 1062. 

2:3 And 2532 when they wanted 5302 5660 wine 3631, the mother 3384 of Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto 4314 him 846, They have 2192 5719 no 3756 wine 3631. 

2:4 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto her 846, Woman 1135, what 5101 have I 1698 to do with 2532 thee 4671? mine 3450 hour 5610 is 2240 0 not yet 3768 come 2240 5719. 

2:5 His 846 mother 3384 saith 3004 5719 unto the servants 1249, Whatsoever 3748 302 he saith 3004 5725 unto you 5213, do 4160 5657 [it]. 

2:6 And 1161 there were 2258 5713 set 2749 5740 there 1563 six 1803 waterpots 5201 of stone 3035, after 2596 the manner of the purifying 2512 of the Jews 2453, containing 5562 5723 two 1417 or 2228 three 5140 firkins 3355 apiece 303. 

2:7 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Fill 1072 5657 the waterpots 5201 with water 5204. And 2532 they filled 1072 0 them 846 up 1072 5656 to 2193 the brim 507. 

2:8 And 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Draw out 501 5657 now 3568, and 2532 bear 5342 5720 unto the governor of the feast 755. And 2532 they bare 5342 5656 [it]. 

2:9 1161 When 5613 the ruler of the feast 755 had tasted 1089 5662 the water 5204 that was made 1096 5772 wine 3631, and 2532 knew 1492 5715 not 3756 whence 4159 it was 2076 5748: (but 1161 the servants 1249 which 3588 drew 501 5761 the water 5204 knew 1492 5715) the governor of the feast 755 called 5455 5719 the bridegroom 3566, 

2:10 And 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Every 3956 man 444 at the beginning 4412 doth set forth 5087 5719 good 2570 wine 3631; and 2532 when 3752 men have well drunk 3184 5686, then 5119 that which is worse 1640: [but] thou 4771 hast kept 5083 5758 the good 2570 wine 3631 until 2193 now 737. 

2:11 This 5026 beginning 746 of miracles 4592 did 4160 5656 Jesus 2424 in 1722 Cana 2580 of Galilee 1056, and 2532 manifested forth 5319 5656 his 848 glory 1391; and 2532 his disciples 3101 believed 4100 5656 on 1519 him 846. 

2:12 After 3326 this 5124 he went down 2597 5627 to 1519 Capernaum 2584, he 846, and 2532 his 846 mother 3384, and 2532 his 846 brethren 80, and 2532 his 846 disciples 3101: and 2532 they continued 3306 5656 there 1563 not 3756 many 4183 days 2250. 

2:13 And 2532 the Jews 2453' passover 3957 was 2258 5713 at hand 1451, and 2532 Jesus 2424 went up 305 5627 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414, 

2:14 And 2532 found 2147 5627 in 1722 the temple 2411 those that sold 4453 5723 oxen 1016 and 2532 sheep 4263 and 2532 doves 4058, and 2532 the changers of money 2773 sitting 2521 5740: 

2:15 And 2532 when he had made 4160 5660 a scourge 5416 of 1537 small cords 4979, he drove 1544 5627 them all 3956 out of 1537 the temple 2411, and 5037 the sheep 4263, and 2532 the oxen 1016; and 2532 poured out 1632 5656 the changers 2855' money 2772, and 2532 overthrew 390 5656 the tables 5132; 

2:16 And 2532 said 2036 5627 unto them that sold 4453 5723 doves 4058, Take 142 5657 these things 5023 hence 1782; make 4160 5720 not 3361 my 3450 Father's 3962 house 3624 an house 3624 of merchandise 1712. 

2:17 And 1161 his 846 disciples 3101 remembered 3415 5681 that 3754 it was 2076 5748 written 1125 5772, The zeal 2205 of thine 4675 house 3624 hath eaten 2719 0 me 3165 up 2719 5627. 

2:18 Then 3767 answered 611 5662 the Jews 2453 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, What 5101 sign 4592 shewest thou 1166 5719 unto us 2254, seeing that 3754 thou doest 4160 5719 these things 5023? 

2:19 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Destroy 3089 5657 this 5126 temple 3485, and 2532 in 1722 three 5140 days 2250 I will raise 1453 0 it 846 up 1453 5692. 

2:20 Then 3767 said 2036 5627 the Jews 2453, Forty 5062 and 2532 six 1803 years 2094 was 3618 0 this 3778 temple 3485 in building 3618 5681, and 2532 wilt 1453 0 thou 4771 rear 1453 0 it 846 up 1453 5692 in 1722 three 5140 days 2250? 

2:21 But 1161 he 1565 spake 3004 5707 of 4012 the temple 3485 of his 848 body 4983. 

2:22 When 3753 therefore 3767 he was risen 1453 5681 from 1537 the dead 3498, his 846 disciples 3101 remembered 3415 5681 that 3754 he had said 3004 5707 this 5124 unto them 846; and 2532 they believed 4100 5656 the scripture 1124, and 2532 the word 3056 which 3739 Jesus 2424 had said 2036 5627. 

2:23 Now 1161 when 5613 he was 2258 5713 in 1722 Jerusalem 2414 at 1722 the passover 3957, in 1722 the feast 1859 [day], many 4183 believed 4100 5656 in 1519 his 846 name 3686, when they saw 2334 5723 the miracles 846 4592 which 3739 he did 4160 5707. 

2:24 But 1161 Jesus 2424 did 4100 0 not 3756 commit 4100 5707 himself 1438 unto them 846, because 1223 he 846 knew 1097 5721 all 3956 [men], 

2:25 And 2532 3754 needed 5532 2192 5707 not 3756 that 2443 any 5100 should testify 3140 5661 of 4012 man 444: for 1063 he 846 knew 1097 5707 what 5101 was 2258 5713 in 1722 man 444. 

3:1 1161 There was 2258 5713 a man 444 of 1537 the Pharisees 5330, named 3686 Nicodemus 3530, a ruler 758 of the Jews 2453: 

3:2 The same 3778 came 2064 5627 to 4314 Jesus 2424 by night 3571, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Rabbi 4461, we know 1492 5758 that 3754 thou art 2064 0 a teacher 1320 come 2064 5754 from 575 God 2316: for 1063 no man 3762 can 1410 5736 do 4160 5721 these 5023 miracles 4592 that 3739 thou 4771 doest 4160 5719, except 3362 God 2316 be 5600 5753 with 3326 him 846. 

3:3 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto thee 4671, Except 3362 a man 5100 be born 1080 5686 again 509, he cannot 1410 5736 3756 see 1492 5629 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. 

3:4 Nicodemus 3530 saith 3004 5719 unto 4314 him 846, How 4459 can 1410 5736 a man 444 be born 1080 5683 when he is 5607 5752 old 1088? can 3361 1410 5736 he enter 1525 5629 the second time 1208 into 1519 his 848 mother's 3384 womb 2836, and 2532 be born 1080 5683? 

3:5 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662, Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto thee 4671, Except 3362 a man 5100 be born 1080 5686 of 1537 water 5204 and 2532 [of] the Spirit 4151, he cannot 3756 1410 5736 enter 1525 5629 into 1519 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. 

3:6 That which is born 1080 5772 of 1537 the flesh 4561 is 2076 5748 flesh 4561; and 2532 that which is born 1080 5772 of 1537 the Spirit 4151 is 2076 5748 spirit 4151. 

3:7 Marvel 2296 5661 not 3361 that 3754 I said 2036 5627 unto thee 4671, Ye 5209 must 1163 5748 be born 1080 5683 again 509. 

3:8 The wind 4151 bloweth 4154 5719 where 3699 it listeth 2309 5719, and 2532 thou hearest 191 5719 the sound 5456 thereof 846, but 235 canst 1492 0 not 3756 tell 1492 5758 whence 4159 it cometh 2064 5736, and 2532 whither 4226 it goeth 5217 5719: so 3779 is 2076 5748 every one 3956 that is born 1080 5772 of 1537 the Spirit 4151. 

3:9 Nicodemus 3530 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, How 4459 can 1410 5736 these things 5023 be 1096 5635? 

3:10 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Art 1488 5748 thou 4771 a master 1320 of Israel 2474, and 2532 knowest 1097 5719 not 3756 these things 5023? 

3:11 Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto thee 4671, We speak 2980 5719 that 3754 3739 we do know 1492 5758, and 2532 testify 3140 5719 that 3739 we have seen 3708 5758; and 2532 ye receive 2983 5719 not 3756 our 2257 witness 3141. 

3:12 If 1487 I have told 2036 5627 you 5213 earthly things 1919, and 2532 ye believe 4100 5719 not 3756, how 4459 shall ye believe 4100 5692, if 1437 I tell 2036 5632 you 5213 [of] heavenly things 2032? 

3:13 And 2532 no man 3762 hath ascended up 305 5758 to 1519 heaven 3772, but 1508 he that came down 2597 5631 from 1537 heaven 3772, [even] the Son 5207 of man 444 which 3588 is 5607 5752 in 1722 heaven 3772. 

3:14 And 2532 as 2531 Moses 3475 lifted up 5312 5656 the serpent 3789 in 1722 the wilderness 2048, even so 3779 must 1163 5748 the Son 5207 of man 444 be lifted up 5312 5683: 

3:15 That 3363 0 whosoever 3956 believeth 4100 5723 in 1519 him 846 should 622 0 not 3363 perish 622 5643, but 235 have 2192 5725 eternal 166 life 2222. 

3:16 For 1063 God 2316 so 3779 loved 25 5656 the world 2889, that 5620 he gave 1325 5656 his 848 only begotten 3439 Son 5207, that 2443 whosoever 3956 believeth 4100 5723 in 1519 him 846 should 622 0 not 3361 perish 622 5643, but 235 have 2192 5725 everlasting 166 life 2222. 

3:17 For 1063 God 2316 sent 649 5656 not 3756 his 848 Son 5207 into 1519 the world 2889 to 2443 condemn 2919 5725 the world 2889; but 235 that 2443 the world 2889 through 1223 him 846 might be saved 4982 5686. 

3:18 He that believeth 4100 5723 on 1519 him 846 is 2919 0 not 3756 condemned 2919 5743: but 1161 he that believeth 4100 5723 not 3361 is condemned 2919 5769 already 2235, because 3754 he hath 4100 0 not 3361 believed 4100 5758 in 1519 the name 3686 of the only begotten 3439 Son 5207 of God 2316. 

3:19 And 1161 this 3778 is 2076 5748 the condemnation 2920, that 3754 light 5457 is come 2064 5754 into 1519 the world 2889, and 2532 men 444 loved 25 5656 darkness 4655 rather 3123 than 2228 light 5457, because 1063 their 846 deeds 2041 were 2258 5713 evil 4190. 

3:20 For 1063 every one 3956 that doeth 4238 5723 evil 5337 hateth 3404 5719 the light 5457, neither 2532 3756 cometh 2064 5736 to 4314 the light 5457, lest 3363 his 846 deeds 2041 should be reproved 1651 5686. 

3:21 But 1161 he that doeth 4160 5723 truth 225 cometh 2064 5736 to 4314 the light 5457, that 2443 his 846 deeds 2041 may be made manifest 5319 5686, that 3754 they are 2076 5748 wrought 2038 5772 in 1722 God 2316. 

3:22 After 3326 these things 5023 came 2064 5627 Jesus 2424 and 2532 his 846 disciples 3101 into 1519 the land 1093 of Judaea 2449 2453; and 2532 there 1563 he tarried 1304 5707 with 3326 them 846, and 2532 baptized 907 5707. 

3:23 And 1161 John 2491 also 2532 was 2258 5713 baptizing 907 5723 in 1722 Aenon 137 near 1451 to Salim 4530, because 3754 there was 2258 5713 much 4183 water 5204 there 1563: and 2532 they came 3854 5708, and 2532 were baptized 907 5712. 

3:24 For 1063 John 2491 was 2258 5713 not yet 3768 cast 906 5772 into 1519 prison 5438. 

3:25 Then 3767 there arose 1096 5633 a question 2214 between 3326 [some] of 1537 John's 2491 disciples 3101 and the Jews 2453 about 4012 purifying 2512. 

3:26 And 2532 they came 2064 5627 unto 4314 John 2491, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Rabbi 4461, he 3739 that was 2258 5713 with 3326 thee 4675 beyond 4008 Jordan 2446, to whom 3739 thou 4771 barest witness 3140 5758, behold 2396, the same 3778 baptizeth 907 5719, and 2532 all 3956 [men] come 2064 5736 to 4314 him 846. 

3:27 John 2491 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627, A man 444 can 1410 5736 3756 receive 2983 5721 nothing 3762, except 3362 it be 5600 5753 given 1325 5772 him 846 from 1537 heaven 3772. 

3:28 Ye 5210 yourselves 846 bear 3140 0 me 3427 witness 3140 5719, that 3754 I said 2036 5627, I 1473 am 1510 5748 not 3756 the Christ 5547, but 235 that 3754 I am 1510 5748 sent 649 5772 before 1715 him 1565. 

3:29 He that hath 2192 5723 the bride 3565 is 2076 5748 the bridegroom 3566: but 1161 the friend 5384 of the bridegroom 3566, which 3588 standeth 2476 5761 and 2532 heareth 191 5723 him 846, rejoiceth 5463 5719 greatly 5479 because 1223 of the bridegroom's 3566 voice 5456: this 3778 my 1699 joy 5479 therefore 3767 is fulfilled 4137 5769. 

3:30 He 1565 must 1163 5748 increase 837 5721, but 1161 I 1691 [must] decrease 1642 5745. 

3:31 He that cometh 2064 5740 from above 509 is 2076 5748 above 1883 all 3956: he that is 5607 5752 of 1537 the earth 1093 is 2076 5748 earthly 1537 1093, and 2532 speaketh 2980 5719 of 1537 the earth 1093: he that cometh 2064 5740 from 1537 heaven 3772 is 2076 5748 above 1883 all 3956. 

3:32 And 2532 what 3739 he hath seen 3708 5758 and 2532 heard 191 5656, that 5124 he testifieth 3140 5719; and 2532 no man 3762 receiveth 2983 5719 his 846 testimony 3141. 

3:33 He that hath received 2983 5631 his 846 testimony 3141 hath set to his seal 4972 5656 that 3754 God 2316 is 2076 5748 true 227. 

3:34 For 1063 he whom 3739 God 2316 hath sent 649 5656 speaketh 2980 5719 the words 4487 of God 2316: for 1063 God 2316 giveth 1325 5719 not 3756 the Spirit 4151 by 1537 measure 3358 [unto him]. 

3:35 The Father 3962 loveth 25 5719 the Son 5207, and 2532 hath given 1325 5758 all things 3956 into 1722 his 846 hand 5495. 

3:36 He that believeth 4100 5723 on 1519 the Son 5207 hath 2192 5719 everlasting 166 life 2222: and 1161 he that believeth not 544 5723 the Son 5207 shall 3700 0 not 3756 see 3700 5695 life 2222; but 235 the wrath 3709 of God 2316 abideth 3306 5719 on 1909 him 846. 

4:1 When 5613 therefore 3767 the Lord 2962 knew 1097 5627 how 3754 the Pharisees 5330 had heard 191 5656 that 3754 Jesus 2424 made 4160 5719 and 2532 baptized 907 5719 more 4119 disciples 3101 than 2228 John 2491, 

4:2 (Though 2544 Jesus 2424 himself 846 baptized 907 5707 not 3756, but 235 his 846 disciples 3101) 

4:3 He left 863 5656 Judaea 2449, and 2532 departed 565 5627 again 3825 into 1519 Galilee 1056. 

4:4 And 1161 he must needs 1163 5713 go 1330 5738 through 1223 Samaria 4540. 

4:5 Then 3767 cometh he 2064 5736 to 1519 a city 4172 of Samaria 4540, which is called 3004 5746 Sychar 4965, near 4139 to the parcel of ground 5564 that Jacob 2384 gave 1325 5656 to his 848 son 5207 Joseph 2501. 

4:6 Now 1161 Jacob's 2384 well 4077 was 2258 5713 there 1563. Jesus 2424 therefore 3767, being wearied 2872 5761 with 1537 [his] journey 3597, sat 2516 5711 thus 3779 on 1909 the well 4077: [and] it was 2258 5713 about 5616 the sixth 1623 hour 5610. 

4:7 There cometh 2064 5736 a woman 1135 of 1537 Samaria 4540 to draw 501 5658 water 5204: Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto her 846, Give 1325 5628 me 3427 to drink 4095 5629. 

4:8 (For 1063 his 846 disciples 3101 were gone away 565 5715 unto 1519 the city 4172 to 2443 buy 59 5661 meat 5160) 

4:9 Then 3767 saith 3004 5719 the woman 1135 of Samaria 4542 unto him 846, How is it that 4459 thou 4771, being 5607 5752 a Jew 2453, askest 154 5719 drink 4095 5629 of 3844 me 1700, which am 5607 5752 a woman 1135 of Samaria 4542? for 1063 the Jews 2453 have 4798 0 no 3756 dealings 4798 5736 with the Samaritans 4541. 

4:10 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto her 846, If 1487 thou knewest 1492 5715 the gift 1431 of God 2316, and 2532 who 5101 it is 2076 5748 that saith 3004 5723 to thee 4671, Give 1325 5628 me 3427 to drink 4095 5629; thou 4771 wouldest 302 have asked 154 5656 of him 846, and 2532 he would 302 have given 1325 5656 thee 4671 living 2198 5723 water 5204. 

4:11 The woman 1135 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Sir 2962, thou hast 2192 5719 nothing 3777 to draw with 502, and 2532 the well 5421 is 2076 5748 deep 901: from whence 4159 then 3767 hast thou 2192 5719 that living 2198 5723 water 5204? 

4:12 3361 Art 1488 5748 thou 4771 greater 3187 than our 2257 father 3962 Jacob 2384, which 3739 gave 1325 5656 us 2254 the well 5421, and 2532 drank 4095 5627 thereof 1537 846 himself 846, and 2532 his 846 children 5207, and 2532 his 846 cattle 2353? 

4:13 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto her 846, Whosoever 3956 drinketh 4095 5723 of 1537 this 5127 water 5204 shall thirst 1372 5692 again 3825: 

4:14 But 1161 whosoever 3739 302 drinketh 4095 5632 of 1537 the water 5204 that 3739 I 1473 shall give 1325 5692 him 846 shall 1372 0 never 1519 165 3364 thirst 1372 5661; but 235 the water 5204 that 3739 I shall give 1325 5692 him 846 shall be 1096 5695 in 1722 him 846 a well 4077 of water 5204 springing up 242 5740 into 1519 everlasting 166 life 2222. 

4:15 The woman 1135 saith 3004 5719 unto 4314 him 846, Sir 2962, give 1325 5628 me 3427 this 5124 water 5204, that 3363 0 I thirst 1372 5725 not 3363, neither 3366 come 2064 5741 hither 1759 to draw 501 5721. 

4:16 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto her 846, Go 5217 5720, call 5455 5657 thy 4675 husband 435, and 2532 come 2064 5628 hither 1759. 

4:17 The woman 1135 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627, I have 2192 5719 no 3756 husband 435. Jesus 2424 said 3004 5719 unto her 846, Thou hast 2036 0 well 2573 said 2036 5627, 3754 I have 2192 5719 no 3756 husband 435: 

4:18 For 1063 thou hast had 2192 5627 five 4002 husbands 435; and 2532 he whom 3739 thou 2192 0 now 3568 hast 2192 5719 is 2076 5748 not 3756 thy 4675 husband 435: in that 5124 saidst thou 2046 5758 truly 227. 

4:19 The woman 1135 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Sir 2962, I perceive 2334 5719 that 3754 thou 4771 art 1488 5748 a prophet 4396. 

4:20 Our 2257 fathers 3962 worshipped 4352 5656 in 1722 this 5129 mountain 3735; and 2532 ye 5210 say 3004 5719, that 3754 in 1722 Jerusalem 2414 is 2076 5748 the place 5117 where 3699 men ought 1163 5748 to worship 4352 5721. 

4:21 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto her 846, Woman 1135, believe 4100 5657 me 3427, the hour 5610 cometh 3754 2064 5736, when 3753 ye shall 4352 0 neither 3777 in 1722 this 5129 mountain 3735, nor yet 3777 at 1722 Jerusalem 2414, worship 4352 5692 the Father 3962. 

4:22 Ye 5210 worship 4352 5719 ye know 1492 5758 not 3756 what 3739: we know 1492 5758 what 3739 we 2249 worship 4352 5719: for 3754 salvation 4991 is 2076 5748 of 1537 the Jews 2453. 

4:23 But 235 the hour 5610 cometh 2064 5736, and 2532 now 3568 is 2076 5748, when 3753 the true 228 worshippers 4353 shall worship 4352 5692 the Father 3962 in 1722 spirit 4151 and 2532 in truth 225: for 2532 1063 the Father 3962 seeketh 2212 5719 such 5108 to worship 4352 5723 him 846. 

4:24 God 2316 [is] a Spirit 4151: and 2532 they that worship 4352 5723 him 846 must 1163 5748 worship 4352 5721 [him] in 1722 spirit 4151 and 2532 in truth 225. 

4:25 The woman 1135 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, I know 1492 5758 that 3754 Messias 3323 cometh 2064 5736, which 3588 is called 3004 5746 Christ 5547: when 3752 he 1565 is come 2064 5632, he will tell 312 5692 us 2254 all things 3956. 

4:26 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto her 846, I 1473 that speak 2980 5723 unto thee 4671 am 1510 5748 [he]. 

4:27 And 2532 upon 1909 this 5129 came 2064 5627 his 846 disciples 3101, and 2532 marvelled 2296 5656 that 3754 he talked 2980 5707 with 3326 the woman 1135: yet 3305 no man 3762 said 2036 5627, What 5101 seekest thou 2212 5719? or 2228, Why 5101 talkest thou 2980 5719 with 3326 her 846? 

4:28 The woman 1135 then 3767 left 863 5656 her 848 waterpot 5201, and 2532 went her way 565 5627 into 1519 the city 4172, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 to the men 444, 

4:29 Come 1205 5773, see 1492 5628 a man 444, which 3739 told 2036 5627 me 3427 all things 3956 that ever 3745 I did 4160 5656: is 2076 5748 not 3385 this 3778 the Christ 5547? 

4:30 Then 3767 they went 1831 5627 out of 1537 the city 4172, and 2532 came 2064 5711 unto 4314 him 846. 

4:31 1161 In 1722 the mean 3342 while his 846 disciples 3101 prayed 2065 5707 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Master 4461, eat 5315 5628. 

4:32 But 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, I 1473 have 2192 5719 meat 1035 to eat 5315 5629 that 3739 ye 5210 know 1492 0 not 3756 of 1492 5758. 

4:33 Therefore 3767 said 3004 5707 the disciples 3101 one to another 4314 240, Hath 5342 0 any man 5100 3387 brought 5342 5656 him 846 [ought] to eat 5315 5629? 

4:34 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, My 1699 meat 1033 is 2076 5748 to 2443 do 4160 5725 the will 2307 of him that sent 3992 5660 me 3165, and 2532 to finish 5048 5661 his 846 work 2041. 

4:35 Say 3004 5719 not 3756 ye 5210, There 3754 are 2076 5748 yet 2089 four months 5072, and 2532 [then] cometh 2064 5736 harvest 2326? behold 2400 5628, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Lift up 1869 5657 your 5216 eyes 3788, and 2532 look on 2300 5663 the fields 5561; for 3754 they are 1526 5748 white 3022 already 2235 to 4314 harvest 2326. 

4:36 And 2532 he that reapeth 2325 5723 receiveth 2983 5719 wages 3408, and 2532 gathereth 4863 5719 fruit 2590 unto 1519 life 2222 eternal 166: that 2443 both 2532 he that soweth 4687 5723 and 2532 he that reapeth 2325 5723 may rejoice 5463 5725 together 3674. 

4:37 And 1063 herein 1722 5129 is 2076 5748 that saying 3056 true 228, 3754 One 243 soweth 2076 5748 4687 5723, and 2532 another 243 reapeth 2325 5723. 

4:38 I 1473 sent 649 5656 you 5209 to reap 2325 5721 that whereon 3739 ye 5210 bestowed 2872 0 no 3756 labour 2872 5758: other men 243 laboured 2872 5758, and 2532 ye 5210 are entered 1525 5754 into 1519 their 846 labours 2873. 

4:39 And 1161 many 4183 of the Samaritans 4541 of 1537 that 1565 city 4172 believed 4100 5656 on 1519 him 846 for 1223 the saying 3056 of the woman 1135, which testified 3140 5723, 3754 He told 2036 5627 me 3427 all 3956 that ever 3745 I did 4160 5656. 

4:40 So 3767 when 5613 the Samaritans 4541 were come 2064 5627 unto 4314 him 846, they besought 2065 5707 him 846 that he would tarry 3306 5658 with 3844 them 846: and 2532 he abode 3306 5656 there 1563 two 1417 days 2250. 

4:41 And 2532 many 4183 more 4119 believed 4100 5656 because 1223 of his own 846 word 3056; 

4:42 And 5037 said 3004 5707 unto the woman 1135, 3754 Now 3765 we believe 4100 5719, not 3754 because 1223 of thy 4674 saying 2981: for 1063 we have heard 191 5754 [him] ourselves 846, and 2532 know 1492 5758 that 3754 this 3778 is 2076 5748 indeed 230 the Christ 5547, the Saviour 4990 of the world 2889. 

4:43 Now 1161 after 3326 two 1417 days 2250 he departed 565 5627 1831 5627 thence 1564, and 2532 went into 1519 Galilee 1056. 

4:44 For 1063 Jesus 2424 himself 846 testified 3140 5656, that 3754 a prophet 4396 hath 2192 5719 no 3756 honour 5092 in 1722 his own 2398 country 3968. 

4:45 Then 3767 when 3753 he was come 2064 5627 into 1519 Galilee 1056, the Galilaeans 1057 received 1209 5662 him 846, having seen 3708 5761 all the things 3956 that 3739 he did 4160 5656 at 1722 Jerusalem 2414 at 1722 the feast 1859: for 1063 they 846 also 2532 went 2064 5627 unto 1519 the feast 1859. 

4:46 So 3767 Jesus 2424 came 2064 5627 again 3825 into 1519 Cana 2580 of Galilee 1056, where 3699 he made 4160 5656 the water 5204 wine 3631. And 2532 there was 2258 5713 a certain 5100 nobleman 937, whose 3739 son 5207 was sick 770 5707 at 1722 Capernaum 2584. 

4:47 When he 3778 heard 191 5660 that 3754 Jesus 2424 was come 2240 5719 out of 1537 Judaea 2449 into 1519 Galilee 1056, he went 565 5627 unto 4314 him 846, and 2532 besought 2065 5707 him 846 that 2443 he would come down 2597 5632, and 2532 heal 2390 5667 his 846 son 5207: for 1063 he was at the point 3195 5707 of death 599 5721. 

4:48 Then 3767 said 2036 5627 Jesus 2424 unto 4314 him 846, Except 3362 ye see 1492 5632 signs 4592 and 2532 wonders 5059, ye will 4100 0 not 3364 believe 4100 5661. 

4:49 The nobleman 937 saith 3004 5719 unto 4314 him 846, Sir 2962, come down 2597 5628 ere 4250 my 3450 child 3813 die 599 5629. 

4:50 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Go thy way 4198 5737; thy 4675 son 5207 liveth 2198 5719. And 2532 the man 444 believed 4100 5656 the word 3056 that 3739 Jesus 2424 had spoken 2036 5627 unto him 846, and 2532 he went his way 4198 5711. 

4:51 And 1161 as he was now 2235 going down 2597 5723, his 846 servants 1401 met 528 5656 him 846, and 2532 told 518 5656 [him], saying 3004 5723, 3754 Thy 4675 son 3816 liveth 2198 5719. 

4:52 Then 3767 enquired he 4441 5633 of 3844 them 846 the hour 5610 when 1722 3739 he began 2192 5627 to amend 2866. And 2532 they said 2036 5627 unto him 846, 3754 Yesterday 5504 at the seventh 1442 hour 5610 the fever 4446 left 863 5656 him 846. 

4:53 So 3767 the father 3962 knew 1097 5627 that 3754 [it was] at 1722 the same 1565 hour 5610, in 1722 the which 3739 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, 3754 Thy 4675 son 5207 liveth 2198 5719: and 2532 himself 846 believed 4100 5656, and 2532 his 846 whole 3650 house 3614. 

4:54 This 5124 [is] again 3825 the second 1208 miracle 4592 [that] Jesus 2424 did 4160 5656, when he was come out 2064 5631 of 1537 Judaea 2449 into 1519 Galilee 1056. 

5:1 After 3326 this 5023 there was 2258 5713 a feast 1859 of the Jews 2453; and 2532 Jesus 2424 went up 305 5627 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414. 

5:2 Now 1161 there is 2076 5748 at 1722 Jerusalem 2414 by 1909 the sheep 4262 [market] a pool 2861, which 3588 is called 1951 5746 in the Hebrew tongue 1447 Bethesda 964, having 2192 5723 five 4002 porches 4745. 

5:3 In 1722 these 5025 lay 2621 5711 a great 4183 multitude 4128 of impotent folk 770 5723, of blind 5185, halt 5560, withered 3584, waiting for 1551 5740 the moving 2796 of the water 5204. 

5:4 For 1063 an angel 32 went down 2597 5707 at 2596 a certain season 2540 into 1722 the pool 2861, and 2532 troubled 5015 5707 the water 5204: whosoever then 3767 first 4413 after 3326 the troubling 5016 of the water 5204 stepped in 1684 5631 was made 1096 5711 whole 5199 of 3739 whatsoever 1221 disease 3553 he had 2722 5712. 

5:5 And 1161 a certain 5100 man 444 was 2258 5713 there 1563, which had 2192 5723 an infirmity 1722 769 thirty 5144 and eight 3638 years 2094. 

5:6 When Jesus 2424 saw 1492 5631 him 5126 lie 2621 5740, and 2532 knew 1097 5631 that 3754 he had been 2192 5719 now 2235 a long 4183 time 5550 [in that case], he saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Wilt thou 2309 5719 be made 1096 5635 whole 5199? 

5:7 The impotent man 770 5723 answered 611 5662 him 846, Sir 2962, I have 2192 5719 no 3756 man 444, when 3752 the water 5204 is troubled 5015 5686, to 2443 put 906 5725 me 3165 into 1519 the pool 2861: but 1161 while 1722 3739 I 1473 am coming 2064 5736, another 243 steppeth down 2597 5719 before 4253 me 1700. 

5:8 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Rise 1453 5669, take up 142 5657 thy 4675 bed 2895, and 2532 walk 4043 5720. 

5:9 And 2532 immediately 2112 the man 444 was made 1096 5633 whole 5199, and 2532 took up 142 5656 his 848 bed 2895, and 2532 walked 4043 5707: and 1161 on 1722 the same 1565 day 2250 was 2258 5713 the sabbath 4521. 

5:10 The Jews 2453 therefore 3767 said 3004 5707 unto him that was cured 2323 5772, It is 2076 5748 the sabbath day 4521: it is 1832 0 not 3756 lawful 1832 5748 for thee 4671 to carry 142 5658 [thy] bed 2895. 

5:11 He answered 611 5662 them 846, He that made 4160 5660 me 3165 whole 5199, the same 1565 said 2036 5627 unto me 3427, Take up 142 5657 thy 4675 bed 2895, and 2532 walk 4043 5720. 

5:12 Then 3767 asked they 2065 5656 him 846, What 3739 5101 man 444 is 2076 5748 that which 3588 said 2036 5631 unto thee 4671, Take up 142 5657 thy 4675 bed 2895, and 2532 walk 4043 5720? 

5:13 And 1161 he that was healed 2390 5685 wist 1492 5715 not 3756 who 5101 it was 2076 5748: for 1063 Jesus 2424 had conveyed himself away 1593 5656, a multitude 3793 being 5607 5752 in 1722 [that] place 5117. 

5:14 Afterward 3326 5023 Jesus 2424 findeth 2147 5719 him 846 in 1722 the temple 2411, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Behold 2396, thou art made 1096 5754 whole 5199: sin 264 5720 no more 3371, lest 3363 a worse thing 5501 5100 come 1096 5638 unto thee 4671. 

5:15 The man 444 departed 565 5627, and 2532 told 312 5656 the Jews 2453 that 3754 it was 2076 5748 Jesus 2424, which 3588 had made 4160 5660 him 846 whole 5199. 

5:16 And 2532 therefore 1223 5124 did 1377 0 the Jews 2453 persecute 1377 5707 Jesus 2424, and 2532 sought 2212 5707 to slay 615 5658 him 846, because 3754 he had done 4160 5707 these things 5023 on 1722 the sabbath day 4521. 

5:17 But 1161 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 them 846, My 3450 Father 3962 worketh 2038 5736 hitherto 2193 737, and I 2504 work 2038 5736. 

5:18 Therefore 1223 5124 3767 the Jews 2453 sought 2212 5707 the more 3123 to kill 615 5658 him 846, because 3754 he 3089 0 not 3756 only 3440 had broken 3089 5707 the sabbath 4521, but 235 said 3004 5707 also 2532 that God 2316 was his 2398 Father 3962, making 4160 5723 himself 1438 equal 2470 with God 2316. 

5:19 Then 3767 answered 611 5662 Jesus 2424 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, The Son 5207 can 1410 5736 3756 do 4160 5721 nothing 3762 of 575 himself 1438, but 3362 what 5100 he seeth 991 5725 the Father 3962 do 4160 5723: for 1063 what things soever 302 he 1565 doeth 4160 5725, these 5023 also 2532 doeth 4160 5719 the Son 5207 likewise 3668. 

5:20 For 1063 the Father 3962 loveth 5368 5719 the Son 5207, and 2532 sheweth 1166 5719 him 846 all things 3956 that 3739 himself 846 doeth 4160 5719: and 2532 he will shew 1166 5692 him 846 greater 3187 0 works 2041 than 3187 these 5130, that 2443 ye 5210 may marvel 2296 5725. 

5:21 For 1063 as 5618 the Father 3962 raiseth up 1453 5719 the dead 3498, and 2532 quickeneth 2227 5719 [them]; even 2532 so 3779 the Son 5207 quickeneth 2227 5719 whom 3739 he will 2309 5719. 

5:22 For 1063 3761 the Father 3962 judgeth 2919 5719 no man 3762, but 235 hath committed 1325 5758 all 3956 judgment 2920 unto the Son 5207: 

5:23 That 2443 all 3956 [men] should honour 5091 5725 the Son 5207, even as 2531 they honour 5091 5719 the Father 3962. He that honoureth 5091 5723 not 3361 the Son 5207 honoureth 5091 5719 not 3756 the Father 3962 which 3588 hath sent 3992 5660 him 846. 

5:24 Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, 3754 He that heareth 191 5723 my 3450 word 3056, and 2532 believeth 4100 5723 on him that sent 3992 5660 me 3165, hath 2192 5719 everlasting 166 life 2222, and 2532 shall 2064 0 not 3756 come 2064 5736 into 1519 condemnation 2920; but 235 is passed 3327 5758 from 1537 death 2288 unto 1519 life 2222. 

5:25 Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, 3754 The hour 5610 is coming 2064 5736, and 2532 now 3568 is 2076 5748, when 3753 the dead 3498 shall hear 191 5695 the voice 5456 of the Son 5207 of God 2316: and 2532 they that hear 191 5660 shall live 2198 5695. 

5:26 For 1063 as 5618 the Father 3962 hath 2192 5719 life 2222 in 1722 himself 1438; so 2532 3779 hath he given 1325 5656 to the Son 5207 to have 2192 5721 life 2222 in 1722 himself 1438; 

5:27 And 2532 hath given 1325 5656 him 846 authority 1849 to execute 4160 5721 judgment 2920 also 2532, because 3754 he is 2076 5748 the Son 5207 of man 444. 

5:28 Marvel 2296 5720 not 3361 at this 5124: for 3754 the hour 5610 is coming 2064 5736, in 1722 the which 3739 all 3956 that are in 1722 the graves 3419 shall hear 191 5695 his 846 voice 5456, 

5:29 And 2532 shall come forth 1607 5695; they that have done 4160 5660 good 18, unto 1519 the resurrection 386 of life 2222; and 1161 they that have done 4238 5660 evil 5337, unto 1519 the resurrection 386 of damnation 2920. 

5:30 I 1473 can 1410 5736 of 575 mine own self 1683 do 4160 5721 nothing 3756 3762: as 2531 I hear 191 5719, I judge 2919 5719: and 2532 my 1699 judgment 2920 is 2076 5748 just 1342; because 3754 I seek 2212 5719 not 3756 mine own 1699 will 2307, but 235 the will 2307 of the Father 3962 which 3739 hath sent 3992 5660 me 3165. 

5:31 If 1437 I 1473 bear witness 3140 5725 of 4012 myself 1683, my 3450 witness 3141 is 2076 5748 not 3756 true 227. 

5:32 There is 2076 5748 another 243 that beareth witness 3140 5723 of 4012 me 1700; and 2532 I know 1492 5758 that 3754 the witness 3141 which 3739 he witnesseth 3140 5719 of 4012 me 1700 is 2076 5748 true 227. 

5:33 Ye 5210 sent 649 5758 unto 4314 John 2491, and 2532 he bare witness 3140 5758 unto the truth 225. 

5:34 But 1161 I 1473 receive 2983 5719 not 3756 testimony 3141 from 3844 man 444: but 235 these things 5023 I say 3004 5719, that 2443 ye 5210 might be saved 4982 5686. 

5:35 He 1565 was 2258 5713 a burning 2545 5746 and 2532 a shining 5316 5723 light 3088: and 1161 ye 5210 were willing 2309 5656 for 4314 a season 5610 to rejoice 21 5677 in 1722 his 846 light 5457. 

5:36 But 1161 I 1473 have 2192 5719 greater 3187 witness 3141 than [that] of John 2491: for 1063 the works 2041 which 3739 the Father 3962 hath given 1325 5656 me 3427 to 2443 finish 5048 5661 846, the same 846 works 2041 that 3739 I 1473 do 4160 5719, bear witness 3140 5719 of 4012 me 1700, that 3754 the Father 3962 hath sent 649 5758 me 3165. 

5:37 And 2532 the Father 3962 himself 846, which hath sent 3992 5660 me 3165, hath borne witness 3140 5758 of 4012 me 1700. Ye have 191 0 neither 3777 heard 191 5754 his 846 voice 5456 at any time 4455, nor 3777 seen 3708 5758 his 846 shape 1491. 

5:38 And 2532 ye have 2192 5719 not 3756 his 846 word 3056 abiding 3306 5723 in 1722 you 5213: for 3754 whom 3739 1565 he hath sent 649 5656, him 5129 ye 5210 believe 4100 5719 not 3756. 

5:39 Search 2045 5719 5720 the scriptures 1124; for 3754 in 1722 them 846 ye 5210 think 1380 5719 ye have 2192 5721 eternal 166 life 2222: and 2532 they 1565 are they 1526 5748 which testify 3140 5723 of 4012 me 1700. 

5:40 And 2532 ye will 2309 5719 not 3756 come 2064 5629 to 4314 me 3165, that 2443 ye might have 2192 5725 life 2222. 

5:41 I receive 2983 5719 not 3756 honour 1391 from 3844 men 444. 

5:42 But 235 I know 1097 5758 you 5209, that 3754 ye have 2192 5719 not 3756 the love 26 of God 2316 in 1722 you 1438. 

5:43 I am 1473 come 2064 5754 in 1722 my 3450 Father's 3962 name 3686, and 2532 ye receive 2983 5719 me 3165 not 3756: if 1437 another 243 shall come 2064 5632 in 1722 his own 2398 name 3686, him 1565 ye will receive 2983 5695. 

5:44 How 4459 can 1410 5736 ye 5210 believe 4100 5658, which receive 2983 5723 honour 1391 one of another 3844 240, and 2532 seek 2212 5719 not 3756 the honour 1391 that [cometh] from 3844 God 2316 only 3441? 

5:45 Do 1380 0 not 3361 think 1380 5720 that 3754 I 1473 will accuse 2723 5692 you 5216 to 4314 the Father 3962: there is 2076 5748 [one] that accuseth 2723 5723 you 5216, [even] Moses 3475, in 1519 whom 3739 ye 5210 trust 1679 5758. 

5:46 For 1063 1487 had ye believed 4100 5707 Moses 3475, ye would have believed 4100 5707 302 me 1698: for 1063 he 1565 wrote 1125 5656 of 4012 me 1700. 

5:47 But 1161 if 1487 ye believe 4100 5719 not 3756 his 1565 writings 1121, how 4459 shall ye believe 4100 5692 my 1699 words 4487? 

6:1 After 3326 these things 5023 Jesus 2424 went 565 5627 over 4008 the sea 2281 of Galilee 1056, which is [the sea] of Tiberias 5085. 

6:2 And 2532 a great 4183 multitude 3793 followed 190 5707 him 846, because 3754 they saw 3708 5707 his 846 miracles 4592 which 3739 he did 4160 5707 on 1909 them that were diseased 770 5723. 

6:3 And 1161 Jesus 2424 went up 424 5627 into 1519 a mountain 3735, and 2532 there 1563 he sat 2521 5711 with 3326 his 848 disciples 3101. 

6:4 And 1161 the passover 3957, a feast 1859 of the Jews 2453, was 2258 5713 nigh 1451. 

6:5 When Jesus 2424 then 3767 lifted up 1869 5660 [his] eyes 3788, and 2532 saw 2300 5666 3754 a great 4183 company 3793 come 2064 5736 unto 4314 him 848, he saith 3004 5719 unto 4314 Philip 5376, Whence 4159 shall we buy 59 5692 bread 740, that 2443 these 3778 may eat 5315 5632? 

6:6 And 1161 this 5124 he said 3004 5707 to prove 3985 5723 him 846: for 1063 he himself 846 knew 1492 5715 what 5101 he would 3195 5707 do 4160 5721. 

6:7 Philip 5376 answered 611 5662 him 846, Two hundred 1250 pennyworth 1220 of bread 740 is 714 0 not 3756 sufficient 714 5719 for them 846, that 2443 every one 1538 of them 846 may take 2983 5632 a 5100 little 1024. 

6:8 One 1520 of 1537 his 846 disciples 3101, Andrew 406, Simon 4613 Peter's 4074 brother 80, saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, 

6:9 There is 2076 5748 a 1520 lad 3808 here 5602, which 3739 hath 2192 5719 five 4002 barley 2916 loaves 740, and 2532 two 1417 small fishes 3795: but 235 what 5101 are 2076 5748 they 5023 among 1519 so many 5118? 

6:10 And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627, Make 4160 5657 the men 444 sit down 377 5629. Now 1161 there was 2258 5713 much 4183 grass 5528 in 1722 the place 5117. So 3767 the men 435 sat down 377 5627, in number 706 about 5616 five thousand 4000. 

6:11 And 1161 Jesus 2424 took 2983 5627 the loaves 740; and 2532 when he had given thanks 2168 5660, he distributed 1239 5656 to the disciples 3101, and 1161 the disciples 3101 to them that were set down 345 5740; and 2532 likewise 3668 of 1537 the fishes 3795 as much as 3745 they would 2309 5707. 

6:12 When 1161 5613 they were filled 1705 5681, he said 3004 5719 unto his 848 disciples 3101, Gather up 4863 5628 the fragments 2801 that remain 4052 5660, that nothing 3363 5100 be lost 622 5643. 

6:13 Therefore 3767 they gathered [them] together 4863 5627, and 2532 filled 1072 5656 twelve 1427 baskets 2894 with the fragments 2801 of 1537 the five 4002 barley 2916 loaves 740, which 3739 remained over and above 4052 5656 unto them that had eaten 977 5761. 

6:14 Then 3767 those men 444, when they had seen 1492 5631 the miracle 4592 that 3739 Jesus 2424 did 4160 5656, said 3004 5707, This 3754 3778 is 2076 5748 of a truth 230 that prophet 4396 that should come 2064 5740 into 1519 the world 2889. 

6:15 When Jesus 2424 therefore 3767 perceived 1097 5631 that 3754 they would 3195 5719 come 2064 5738 and 2532 take 726 0 him 846 by force 726 5721, to 2443 make 4160 5661 him 846 a king 935, he departed 402 5656 again 3825 into 1519 a mountain 3735 himself 846 alone 3441. 

6:16 And 1161 when 5613 even 3798 was [now] come 1096 5633, his 846 disciples 3101 went down 2597 5627 unto 1909 the sea 2281, 

6:17 And 2532 entered 1684 5631 into 1519 a ship 4143, and went 2064 5711 over 4008 the sea 2281 toward 1519 Capernaum 2584. And 2532 it was 1096 5715 now 2235 dark 4653, and 2532 Jesus 2424 was 2064 0 not 3756 come 2064 5715 to 4314 them 846. 

6:18 And 5037 the sea 2281 arose 1326 5712 by reason of a great 3173 wind 417 that blew 4154 5723. 

6:19 So 3767 when they had rowed 1643 5761 about 5613 five 4002 and twenty 1501 or 2228 thirty 5144 furlongs 4712, they see 2334 5719 Jesus 2424 walking 4043 5723 on 1909 the sea 2281, and 2532 drawing 1096 5740 nigh 1451 unto the ship 4143: and 2532 they were afraid 5399 5675. 

6:20 But 1161 he saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, It is 1510 5748 I 1473; be 5399 0 not 3361 afraid 5399 5737. 

6:21 Then 3767 they willingly 2309 5707 received 2983 5629 him 846 into 1519 the ship 4143: and 2532 immediately 2112 the ship 4143 was 1096 5633 at 1909 the land 1093 whither 1519 3739 they went 5217 5707. 

6:22 The day following 1887, when the people 3793 which 3588 stood 2476 5761 on the other side 4008 of the sea 2281 saw 1492 5631 that 3754 there was 2258 5713 none 3756 other 243 boat 4142 there 1563, save 1508 that 1565 one 1520 whereinto 1519 3739 his 848 disciples 3101 were entered 1684 5627, and 2532 that 3754 Jesus 2424 went 4897 0 not 3756 with 4897 5627 his 846 disciples 3101 into 1519 the boat 4142, but 235 [that] his 846 disciples 3101 were gone away 565 5627 alone 3441; 

6:23 (Howbeit 235 1161 there came 2064 5627 other 243 boats 4142 from 1537 Tiberias 5085 nigh 1451 unto the place 5117 where 3699 they did eat 5315 5627 bread 740, after that the Lord 2962 had given thanks 2168 5660) 

6:24 When 3753 the people 3793 therefore 3767 saw 1492 5627 that 3754 Jesus 2424 was 2076 5748 not 3756 there 1563, neither 3761 his 846 disciples 3101, they 846 also 2532 took 1684 5627 1519 shipping 4143, and 2532 came 2064 5627 to 1519 Capernaum 2584, seeking for 2212 5723 Jesus 2424. 

6:25 And 2532 when they had found 2147 5631 him 846 on the other side 4008 of the sea 2281, they said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Rabbi 4461, when 4219 camest thou 1096 5754 hither 5602? 

6:26 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 them 846 and 2532 said 2036 5627, Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Ye seek 2212 5719 me 3165, not 3756 because 3754 ye saw 1492 5627 the miracles 4592, but 235 because 3754 ye did eat 5315 5627 of 1537 the loaves 740, and 2532 were filled 5526 5681. 

6:27 Labour 2038 5737 not 3361 for the meat 1035 which 3588 perisheth 622 5734, but 235 for that meat 1035 which 3588 endureth 3306 5723 unto 1519 everlasting 166 life 2222, which 3739 the Son 5207 of man 444 shall give 1325 5692 unto you 5213: for 1063 him 5126 hath 4972 0 God 2316 the Father 3962 sealed 4972 5656. 

6:28 Then 3767 said they 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, What 5101 shall we do 4160 5719 5625 4160 5725, that 2443 we might work 2038 5741 the works 2041 of God 2316? 

6:29 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, This 5124 is 2076 5748 the work 2041 of God 2316, that 2443 ye believe 4100 5661 on 1519 him 3739 whom 1565 he hath sent 649 5656. 

6:30 They said 2036 5627 therefore 3767 unto him 846, What 5101 sign 4592 shewest 4160 5719 thou 4771 then 3767, that 2443 we may see 1492 5632, and 2532 believe 4100 5661 thee 4671? what 5101 dost thou work 2038 5736? 

6:31 Our 2257 fathers 3962 did eat 5315 5627 manna 3131 in 1722 the desert 2048; as 2531 it is 2076 5748 written 1125 5772, He gave 1325 5656 them 846 bread 740 from 1537 heaven 3772 to eat 5315 5629. 

6:32 Then 3767 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Moses 3475 gave 1325 5758 you 5213 not 3756 that bread 740 from 1537 heaven 3772; but 235 my 3450 Father 3962 giveth 1325 5719 you 5213 the true 228 bread 740 from 1537 heaven 3772. 

6:33 For 1063 the bread 740 of God 2316 is he 2076 5748 which 3588 cometh down 2597 5723 from 1537 heaven 3772, and 2532 giveth 1325 5723 life 2222 unto the world 2889. 

6:34 Then 3767 said they 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Lord 2962, evermore 3842 give 1325 5628 us 2254 this 5126 bread 740. 

6:35 And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, I 1473 am 1510 5748 the bread 740 of life 2222: he that cometh 2064 5740 to 4314 me 3165 shall never 3364 hunger 3983 5661; and 2532 he that believeth 4100 5723 on 1519 me 1691 shall 1372 0 never 3364 4455 thirst 1372 5661. 

6:36 But 235 I said 2036 5627 unto you 5213, That 3754 ye 3708 0 also 2532 have seen 3708 5758 me 3165, and 2532 believe 4100 5719 not 3756. 

6:37 All 3956 that 3739 the Father 3962 giveth 1325 5719 me 3427 shall come 2240 5692 to 4314 me 1691; and 2532 him that cometh 2064 5740 to 4314 me 3165 I will 1544 0 in no wise 3364 cast 1544 5632 out 1854. 

6:38 For 3754 I came down 2597 5758 from 1537 heaven 3772, not 3756 to 2443 do 4160 5725 mine own 1699 will 2307, but 235 the will 2307 of him that sent 3992 5660 me 3165. 

6:39 And 1161 this 5124 is 2076 5748 the Father's 3962 will 2307 which 3588 hath sent 3992 5660 me 3165, that 2443 of all 3956 which 3739 he hath given 1325 5758 me 3427 I should lose 622 5661 nothing 3361 1537 846, but 235 should raise 450 0 it 846 up again 450 5692 at 1722 the last 2078 day 2250. 

6:40 And 1161 this 5124 is 2076 5748 the will 2307 of him that sent 3992 5660 me 3165, that 2443 every one 3956 which 3588 seeth 2334 5723 the Son 5207, and 2532 believeth 4100 5723 on 1519 him 846, may have 2192 5725 everlasting 166 life 2222: and 2532 I 1473 will raise 450 0 him 846 up 450 5692 at the last 2078 day 2250. 

6:41 The Jews 2453 then 3767 murmured 1111 5707 at 4012 him 846, because 3754 he said 2036 5627, I 1473 am 1510 5748 the bread 740 which 3588 came down 2597 5631 from 1537 heaven 3772. 

6:42 And 2532 they said 3004 5707, Is 2076 5748 not 3756 this 3778 Jesus 2424, the son 5207 of Joseph 2501, whose 3739 father 3962 and 2532 mother 3384 we 2249 know 1492 5758? how is it 4459 then 3767 that he 3778 saith 3004 5719, 3754 I came down 2597 5758 from 1537 heaven 3772? 

6:43 Jesus 2424 therefore 3767 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Murmur 1111 5720 not 3361 among 3326 yourselves 240. 

6:44 No man 3762 can 1410 5736 come 2064 5629 to 4314 me 3165, except 3362 the Father 3962 which 3588 hath sent 3992 5660 me 3165 draw 1670 5661 him 846: and 2532 I 1473 will raise 450 0 him 846 up 450 5692 at the last 2078 day 2250. 

6:45 It is 2076 5748 written 1125 5772 in 1722 the prophets 4396, And 2532 they shall be 2071 5704 all 3956 taught 1318 of God 2316. Every man 3956 therefore 3767 that hath heard 191 5660, and 2532 hath learned 3129 5631 of 3844 the Father 3962, cometh 2064 5736 unto 4314 me 3165. 

6:46 Not 3756 that 3754 any man 5100 hath seen 3708 5758 the Father 3962, save 1508 he which 3588 is 3844 5607 5752 of God 2316, he 3778 hath seen 3708 5758 the Father 3962. 

6:47 Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, He that believeth 4100 5723 on 1519 me 1691 hath 2192 5719 everlasting 166 life 2222. 

6:48 I 1473 am 1510 5748 that bread 740 of life 2222. 

6:49 Your 5216 fathers 3962 did eat 5315 5627 manna 3131 in 1722 the wilderness 2048, and 2532 are dead 599 5627. 

6:50 This 3778 is 2076 5748 the bread 740 which 3588 cometh down 2597 5723 from 1537 heaven 3772, that 3363 0 a man 5100 may eat 5315 5632 thereof 1537 846, and 2532 not 3363 die 599 5632. 

6:51 I 1473 am 1510 5748 the living 2198 5723 bread 740 which 3588 came down 2597 5631 from 1537 heaven 3772: if 1437 any man 5100 eat 5315 5632 of 1537 this 5127 bread 740, he shall live 2198 5695 for 1519 ever 165: and 1161 2532 the bread 740 that 3739 I 1473 will give 1325 5692 is 2076 5748 my 3450 flesh 4561, which 3739 I 1473 will give 1325 5692 for 5228 the life 2222 of the world 2889. 

6:52 The Jews 2453 therefore 3767 strove 3164 5711 among 4314 themselves 240, saying 3004 5723, How 4459 can 1410 5736 this man 3778 give 1325 5629 us 2254 [his] flesh 4561 to eat 5315 5629? 

6:53 Then 3767 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Except 3362 ye eat 5315 5632 the flesh 4561 of the Son 5207 of man 444, and 2532 drink 4095 5632 his 846 blood 129, ye have 2192 5719 no 3756 life 2222 in 1722 you 1438. 

6:54 Whoso eateth 5176 5723 my 3450 flesh 4561, and 2532 drinketh 4095 5723 my 3450 blood 129, hath 2192 5719 eternal 166 life 2222; and 2532 I 1473 will raise 450 0 him 846 up 450 5692 at the last 2078 day 2250. 

6:55 For 1063 my 3450 flesh 4561 is 2076 5748 meat 1035 indeed 230, and 2532 my 3450 blood 129 is 2076 5748 drink 4213 indeed 230. 

6:56 He that eateth 5176 5723 my 3450 flesh 4561, and 2532 drinketh 4095 5723 my 3450 blood 129, dwelleth 3306 5719 in 1722 me 1698, and I 2504 in 1722 him 846. 

6:57 As 2531 the living 2198 5723 Father 3962 hath sent 649 5656 me 3165, and I 2504 live 2198 5719 by 1223 the Father 3962: so 2532 he that eateth 5176 5723 me 3165, even he 2548 shall live 2198 5695 by 1223 me 1691. 

6:58 This 3778 is 2076 5748 that bread 740 which 3588 came down 2597 5631 from 1537 heaven 3772: not 3756 as 2531 your 5216 fathers 3962 did eat 5315 5627 manna 3131, and 2532 are dead 599 5627: he that eateth 5176 5723 of this 5126 bread 740 shall live 2198 5695 for 1519 ever 165. 

6:59 These things 5023 said he 2036 5627 in 1722 the synagogue 4864, as he taught 1321 5723 in 1722 Capernaum 2584. 

6:60 Many 4183 therefore 3767 of 1537 his 846 disciples 3101, when they had heard 191 5660 [this], said 2036 5627, This 3778 is 2076 5748 an hard 4642 saying 3056; who 5101 can 1410 5736 hear 191 5721 it 846? 

6:61 When 1161 Jesus 2424 knew 1492 5761 in 1722 himself 1438 that 3754 his 846 disciples 3101 murmured 1111 5719 at 4012 it 5127, he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Doth this 5124 offend 4624 5719 you 5209? 

6:62 [What] and 3767 if 1437 ye shall see 2334 5725 the Son 5207 of man 444 ascend up 305 5723 where 3699 he was 2258 5713 before 4386? 

6:63 It is 2076 5748 the spirit 4151 that quickeneth 2227 5723; the flesh 4561 3756 profiteth 5623 5719 nothing 3762: the words 4487 that 3739 I 1473 speak 2980 5719 unto you 5213, [they] are 2076 5748 spirit 4151, and 2532 [they] are 2076 5748 life 2222. 

6:64 But 235 there are 1526 5748 some 5100 of 1537 you 5216 that believe 4100 5719 not 3756. For 1063 Jesus 2424 knew 1492 5715 from 1537 the beginning 746 who 5101 they were 1526 5748 that believed 4100 5723 not 3361, and 2532 who 5101 should 2076 5748 betray 3860 5694 him 846. 

6:65 And 2532 he said 3004 5707, Therefore 1223 5124 said I 2046 5758 unto you 5213, that 3754 no man 3762 can 1410 5736 come 2064 5629 unto 4314 me 3165, except 3362 it were 5600 5753 given 1325 5772 unto him 846 of 1537 my 3450 Father 3962. 

6:66 From 1537 that 5127 [time] many 4183 of his 846 disciples 3101 went 565 5627 back 1519 3694, and 2532 walked 4043 5707 no more 3765 with 3326 him 846. 

6:67 Then 3767 said 2036 5627 Jesus 2424 unto the twelve 1427, 3361 Will 2309 5719 ye 5210 also 2532 go away 5217 5721? 

6:68 Then 3767 Simon 4613 Peter 4074 answered 611 5662 him 846, Lord 2962, to 4314 whom 5101 shall we go 565 5695? thou hast 2192 5719 the words 4487 of eternal 166 life 2222. 

6:69 And 2532 we 2249 believe 4100 5758 and 2532 are sure 1097 5758 that 3754 thou 4771 art 1488 5748 that Christ 5547, the Son 5207 of the living 2198 5723 God 2316. 

6:70 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 them 846, Have 1586 0 not 3756 I 1473 chosen 1586 5668 you 5209 twelve 1427, and 2532 one 1520 of 1537 you 5216 is 2076 5748 a devil 1228? 

6:71 1161 He spake 3004 5707 of Judas 2455 Iscariot 2469 [the son] of Simon 4613: for 1063 he 3778 it was that should 3195 5707 betray 3860 5722 him 846, being 5607 5752 one 1520 of 1537 the twelve 1427. 

7:1 2532 After 3326 these things 5023 Jesus 2424 walked 4043 5707 in 1722 Galilee 1056: for 1063 he would 2309 5707 not 3756 walk 4043 5721 in 1722 Jewry 2449, because 3754 the Jews 2453 sought 2212 5707 to kill 615 5658 him 846. 

7:2 Now 1161 the Jews 2453' feast 1859 of tabernacles 4634 was 2258 5713 at hand 1451. 

7:3 His 846 brethren 80 therefore 3767 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Depart 3327 5628 hence 1782, and 2532 go 5217 5720 into 1519 Judaea 2449, that 2443 thy 4675 disciples 3101 also 2532 may see 2334 5661 the works 2041 that 3739 thou 4675 doest 4160 5719. 

7:4 For 1063 [there is] no man 3762 [that] doeth 4160 5719 any thing 5100 in 1722 secret 2927, and 2532 he himself 846 seeketh 2212 5719 to be 1511 5750 known openly 1722 3954. If 1487 thou do 4160 5719 these things 5023, shew 5319 5657 thyself 4572 to the world 2889. 

7:5 For 1063 neither 3761 did 4100 0 his 846 brethren 80 believe 4100 5707 in 1519 him 846. 

7:6 Then 3767 Jesus 2424 said 3004 5719 unto them 846, My 1699 time 2540 is 3918 0 not yet 3768 come 3918 5748: but 1161 your 5212 time 2540 is 2076 5748 alway 3842 ready 2092. 

7:7 The world 2889 cannot 3756 1410 5736 hate 3404 5721 you 5209; but 1161 me 1691 it hateth 3404 5719, because 3754 I 1473 testify 3140 5719 of 4012 it 846, that 3754 the works 2041 thereof 846 are 2076 5748 evil 4190. 

7:8 Go 305 0 ye 5210 up 305 5628 unto 1519 this 5026 feast 1859: I 1473 go 305 0 not 3768 0 up 305 5719 yet 3768 unto 1519 this 5026 feast 1859; for 3754 my 1699 time 2540 is 4137 0 not yet 3768 full come 4137 5769. 

7:9 When 1161 he had said 2036 5631 these words 5023 unto them 846, he abode 3306 5656 [still] in 1722 Galilee 1056. 

7:10 But 1161 when 5613 his 846 brethren 80 were gone up 305 5627, then 5119 went he 305 0 also 2532 up 305 5627 unto 1519 the feast 1859, not 3756 openly 5320, but 235 as it were 5613 in 1722 secret 2927. 

7:11 Then 3767 the Jews 2453 sought 2212 5707 him 846 at 1722 the feast 1859, and 2532 said 3004 5707, Where 4226 is 2076 5748 he 1565? 

7:12 And 2532 there was 2258 5713 much 4183 murmuring 1112 among 1722 the people 3793 concerning 4012 him 846: for some 3303 said 3004 5707, 3754 He is 2076 5748 a good man 18: others 1161 243 said 3004 5707, Nay 3756; but 235 he deceiveth 4105 5719 the people 3793. 

7:13 Howbeit 3305 no man 3762 spake 2980 5707 openly 3954 of 4012 him 846 for 1223 fear 5401 of the Jews 2453. 

7:14 Now 2235 about 1161 the midst of 3322 5723 the feast 1859 Jesus 2424 went up 305 5627 into 1519 the temple 2411, and 2532 taught 1321 5707. 

7:15 And 2532 the Jews 2453 marvelled 2296 5707, saying 3004 5723, How 4459 knoweth 1492 5758 this man 3778 letters 1121, having 3129 0 never 3361 learned 3129 5761? 

7:16 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 them 846, and 2532 said 2036 5627, My 1699 doctrine 1322 is 2076 5748 not 3756 mine 1699, but 235 his that sent 3992 5660 me 3165. 

7:17 If 1437 any man 5100 will 2309 5725 do 4160 5721 his 846 will 2307, he shall know 1097 5695 of 4012 the doctrine 1322, whether 4220 it be 2076 5748 of 1537 God 2316, or 2228 [whether] I 1473 speak 2980 5719 of 575 myself 1683. 

7:18 He that speaketh 2980 5723 of 575 himself 1438 seeketh 2212 5719 his own 2398 glory 1391: but 1161 he that seeketh 2212 5723 his glory 1391 that sent 3992 5660 him 846, the same 3778 is 2076 5748 true 227, and 2532 no 3756 unrighteousness 93 is 2076 5748 in 1722 him 846. 

7:19 Did 1325 0 not 3756 Moses 3475 give 1325 5758 you 5213 the law 3551, and 2532 [yet] none 3762 of 1537 you 5216 keepeth 4160 5719 the law 3551? Why 5101 go ye about 2212 5719 to kill 615 5658 me 3165? 

7:20 The people 3793 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627, Thou hast 2192 5719 a devil 1140: who 5101 goeth about 2212 5719 to kill 615 5658 thee 4571? 

7:21 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, I have done 4160 5656 one 1520 work 2041, and 2532 ye 2296 0 all 3956 marvel 2296 5719. 

7:22 Moses 3475 therefore 1223 5124 gave 1325 5758 unto you 5213 circumcision 4061; (not 3756 because 3754 it is 2076 5748 of 1537 Moses 3475, but 235 of 1537 the fathers 3962) and 2532 ye 4059 0 on 1722 the sabbath day 4521 circumcise 4059 5719 a man 444. 

7:23 If 1487 a man 444 on 1722 the sabbath day 4521 receive 2983 5719 circumcision 4061, that 3363 0 the law 3551 of Moses 3475 should 3089 0 not 3363 be broken 3089 5686; are ye angry 5520 5719 at me 1698, because 3754 I have made 4160 5656 a man 444 every whit 3650 whole 5199 on 1722 the sabbath day 4521? 

7:24 Judge 2919 5720 not 3361 according to 2596 the appearance 3799, but 235 judge 2919 5657 righteous 1342 judgment 2920. 

7:25 Then 3767 said 3004 5707 some 5100 of 1537 them of Jerusalem 2415, Is 2076 5748 not 3756 this 3778 he, whom 3739 they seek 2212 5719 to kill 615 5658? 

7:26 But 2532, lo 2396, he speaketh 2980 5719 boldly 3954, and 2532 they say 3004 5719 nothing 3762 unto him 846. Do 1097 0 the rulers 758 know 1097 5627 indeed 3379 230 that 3754 this 3778 is 2076 5748 the very 230 Christ 5547? 

7:27 Howbeit 235 we know 1492 5758 this man 5126 whence 4159 he is 2076 5748: but 1161 when 3752 Christ 5547 cometh 2064 5741, no man 3762 knoweth 1097 5719 whence 4159 he is 2076 5748. 

7:28 Then 3767 cried 2896 5656 Jesus 2424 in 1722 the temple 2411 as he taught 1321 5723, 2532 saying 3004 5723, Ye both 2504 know me 1492 5758, and 2532 ye know 1492 5758 whence 4159 I am 1510 5748: and 2532 I am 2064 0 not 3756 come 2064 5754 of 575 myself 1683, but 235 he that sent 3992 5660 me 3165 is 2076 5748 true 228, whom 3739 ye 5210 know 1492 5758 not 3756. 

7:29 But 1161 I 1473 know 1492 5758 him 846: for 3754 I am 1510 5748 from 3844 him 846, and he 2548 hath sent 649 5656 me 3165. 

7:30 Then 3767 they sought 2212 5707 to take 4084 5658 him 846: but 2532 no man 3762 laid 1911 5627 hands 5495 on 1909 him 846, because 3754 his 846 hour 5610 was 2064 0 not yet 3768 come 2064 5715. 

7:31 And 1161 many 4183 of 1537 the people 3793 believed 4100 5656 on 1519 him 846, and 2532 said 3004 5707, 3754 When 3752 Christ 5547 cometh 2064 5632, will he do 3385 4160 5692 more 4119 miracles 4592 than these 5130 which 3739 this 3778 [man] hath done 4160 5656? 

7:32 The Pharisees 5330 heard 191 5656 that the people 3793 murmured 1111 5723 such things 5023 concerning 4012 him 846; and 2532 the Pharisees 5330 and 2532 the chief priests 749 sent 649 5656 officers 5257 to 2443 take 4084 5661 him 846. 

7:33 Then 3767 said 2036 5627 Jesus 2424 unto them 846, Yet 2089 a little 3398 while 5550 am I 1510 5748 with 3326 you 5216, and 2532 [then] I go 5217 5719 unto 4314 him that sent 3992 5660 me 3165. 

7:34 Ye shall seek 2212 5692 me 3165, and 2532 shall 2147 0 not 3756 find 2147 5692 [me]: and 2532 where 3699 I 1473 am 1510 5748, [thither] ye 5210 cannot 3756 1410 5736 come 2064 5629. 

7:35 Then 3767 said 2036 5627 the Jews 2453 among 4314 themselves 1438, Whither 4226 will 3195 5719 he 3778 go 4198 5738, that 3754 we 2249 shall 2147 0 not 3756 find 2147 5692 him 846? will 3361 3195 5719 he go 4198 5738 unto 1519 the dispersed 1290 among the Gentiles 1672, and 2532 teach 1321 5721 the Gentiles 1672? 

7:36 What 5101 [manner of] saying 3056 is 2076 5748 this 3778 that 3739 he said 2036 5627, Ye shall seek 2212 5692 me 3165, and 2532 shall 2147 0 not 3756 find 2147 5692 [me]: and 2532 where 3699 I 1473 am 1510 5748, [thither] ye 5210 cannot 3756 1410 5736 come 2064 5629? 

7:37 1161 In 1722 the last 2078 day 2250, that great 3173 [day] of the feast 1859, Jesus 2424 stood 2476 5715 and 2532 cried 2896 5656, saying 3004 5723, If 1437 any man 5100 thirst 1372 5725, let him come 2064 5737 unto 4314 me 3165, and 2532 drink 4095 5720. 

7:38 He that believeth 4100 5723 on 1519 me 1691, as 2531 the scripture 1124 hath said 2036 5627, out of 1537 his 846 belly 2836 shall flow 4482 5692 rivers 4215 of living 2198 5723 water 5204. 

7:39 (But 1161 this 5124 spake he 2036 5627 of 4012 the Spirit 4151, which 3739 they that believe 4100 5723 on 1519 him 846 should 3195 5707 receive 2983 5721: for 1063 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 was 2258 5713 not yet 3768 [given]; because 3754 that Jesus 2424 was 1392 0 not yet 3764 glorified 1392 5681) 

7:40 Many 4183 of 1537 the people 3793 therefore 3767, when they heard 191 5660 this saying 3056, said 3004 5707, Of a truth 230 this 3778 is 2076 5748 the Prophet 4396. 

7:41 Others 243 said 3004 5707, This 3778 is 2076 5748 the Christ 5547. But 1161 some 243 said 3004 5707, 1063 Shall 3361 Christ 5547 come 2064 5736 out of 1537 Galilee 1056? 

7:42 Hath not 3780 the scripture 1124 said 2036 5627, That 3754 Christ 5547 cometh 2064 5736 of 1537 the seed 4690 of David 1138, and 2532 out of 575 the town 2968 of Bethlehem 965, where 3699 David 1138 was 2258 5713? 

7:43 So 3767 there was 1096 5633 a division 4978 among 1722 the people 3793 because 1223 of him 846. 

7:44 And 1161 some 5100 of 1537 them 846 would 2309 5707 have taken 4084 5658 him 846; but 235 no man 3762 laid 1911 5627 hands 5495 on 1909 him 846. 

7:45 Then 3767 came 2064 5627 the officers 5257 to 4314 the chief priests 749 and 2532 Pharisees 5330; and 2532 they 1565 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Why 1302 have ye 71 0 not 3756 brought 71 5627 him 846? 

7:46 The officers 5257 answered 611 5662, Never 3763 man 444 spake 3779 2980 5656 like 5613 this 3778 man 444. 

7:47 Then 3767 answered 611 5662 them 846 the Pharisees 5330, Are 4105 0 ye 5210 also 2532 deceived 4105 5769 3361? 

7:48 Have any 3387 5100 of 1537 the rulers 758 or 2228 of 1537 the Pharisees 5330 believed 4100 5656 on 1519 him 846? 

7:49 But 235 this 3778 people 3793 who 3588 knoweth 1097 5723 not 3361 the law 3551 are 1526 5748 cursed 1944. 

7:50 Nicodemus 3530 saith 3004 5719 unto 4314 them 846, (he that came 2064 5631 to Jesus 846 by 4314 night 3571, being 5607 5752 one 1520 of 1537 them 846) 

7:51 Doth 2919 0 our 2257 law 3551 judge 2919 5719 3361 [any] man 444, before 4386 3362 it hear 191 5661 3844 him 846, and 2532 know 1097 5632 what 5101 he doeth 4160 5719? 

7:52 They answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Art 3361 1488 5748 thou 4771 also 2532 of 1537 Galilee 1056? Search 2045 5657, and 2532 look 2396: for 3754 out of 1537 Galilee 1056 ariseth 1453 5769 no 3756 prophet 4396. 

7:53 And 2532 every man 1538 went 4198 5675 unto 1519 his own 848 house 3624. 

8:1 1161 Jesus 2424 went 4198 5675 unto 1519 the mount 3735 of Olives 1636. 

8:2 And 1161 early in the morning 3722 he came 3854 5633 again 3825 into 1519 the temple 2411, and 2532 all 3956 the people 2992 came 2064 5711 unto 4314 him 846; and 2532 he sat down 2523 5660, and taught 1321 5707 them 846. 

8:3 And 1161 the scribes 1122 and 2532 Pharisees 5330 brought 71 5719 unto 4314 him 846 a woman 1135 taken 2638 5772 in 1722 adultery 3430; and 2532 when they had set 2476 5660 her 846 in 1722 the midst 3319, 

8:4 They say 3004 5719 unto him 846, Master 1320, this 3778 woman 1135 was taken 2638 5681 in adultery 3431 5746, in the very act 1888. 

8:5 Now 1161 Moses 3475 in 1722 the law 3551 commanded 1781 5662 us 2254, that such 5108 should be stoned 3036 5745: but 3767 what 5101 sayest 3004 5719 thou 4771? 

8:6 1161 This 5124 they said 3004 5707, tempting 3985 5723 him 846, that 2443 they might have 2192 5725 to accuse 2723 5721 him 846. But 1161 Jesus 2424 stooped 2955 5660 down 2736, and with [his] finger 1147 wrote 1125 5707 on 1519 the ground 1093, [as though he heard 4364 5740 them not 3361. 

8:7 So 1161 when 5613 they continued 1961 5707 asking 2065 5723 him 846, he lifted up himself 352 5660, and said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, He that is without sin 361 among you 5216, let him 906 0 first 4413 cast 906 5628 a stone 3037 at 1909 her 846. 

8:8 And 2532 again 3825 he stooped 2955 5660 down 2736, and wrote 1125 5707 on 1519 the ground 1093. 

8:9 And 1161 they which heard 191 5660 [it], 2532 being convicted 1651 5746 by 5259 [their own] conscience 4893, went out 1831 5711 one by one 1527, beginning 756 5671 at 575 the eldest 4245, [even] unto 2193 the last 2078: and 2532 Jesus 2424 was left 2641 5681 alone 3441, and 2532 the woman 1135 standing 2476 5761 in 1722 the midst 3319. 

8:10 When 1161 Jesus 2424 had lifted up himself 352 5660, and 2532 saw 2300 5666 none 3367 but 4133 the woman 1135, he said 2036 5627 unto her 846, Woman 1135, where 4226 are 1526 5748 those 1565 thine 4675 accusers 2725? hath 2632 0 no man 3762 condemned 2632 5656 thee 4571? 

8:11 1161 She said 2036 5627, No man 3762, Lord 2962. And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto her 846, Neither 3761 do 2632 0 I 1473 condemn 2632 5719 thee 4571: go 4198 5737, and 2532 sin 264 5720 no more 3371. 

8:12 Then 3767 spake 2980 5656 Jesus 2424 again 3825 unto them 846, saying 3004 5723, I 1473 am 1510 5748 the light 5457 of the world 2889: he that followeth 190 5723 me 1698 shall 4043 0 not 3364 walk 4043 5692 in 1722 darkness 4653, but 235 shall have 2192 5692 the light 5457 of life 2222. 

8:13 The Pharisees 5330 therefore 3767 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Thou 4771 bearest record 3140 5719 of 4012 thyself 4572; thy 4675 record 3141 is 2076 5748 not 3756 true 227. 

8:14 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Though 2579 I 1473 bear record 3140 5725 of 4012 myself 1683, [yet] my 3450 record 3141 is 2076 5748 true 227: for 3754 I know 1492 5758 whence 4159 I came 2064 5627, and 2532 whither 4226 I go 5217 5719; but 1161 ye 5210 cannot 3756 tell 1492 5758 whence 4159 I come 2064 5736, and 2532 whither 4226 I go 5217 5719. 

8:15 Ye 5210 judge 2919 5719 after 2596 the flesh 4561; I 1473 judge 2919 5719 no 3756 man 3762. 

8:16 And 1161 yet 2532 if 1437 I 1473 judge 2919 5725, my 1699 judgment 2920 is 2076 5748 true 227: for 3754 I am 1510 5748 not 3756 alone 3441, but 235 I 1473 and 2532 the Father 3962 that sent 3992 5660 me 3165. 

8:17 2532 It is 1125 0 also 1161 written 1125 5769 in 1722 your 5212 law 3551, that 3754 the testimony 3141 of two 1417 men 444 is 2076 5748 true 227. 

8:18 I 1473 am 1510 5748 one that bear witness 3140 5723 of 4012 myself 1683, and 2532 the Father 3962 that sent 3992 5660 me 3165 beareth witness 3140 5719 of 4012 me 1700. 

8:19 Then 3767 said they 3004 5707 unto him 846, Where 4226 is 2076 5748 thy 4675 Father 3962? Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662, Ye 1492 0 neither 3777 know 1492 5758 me 1691, nor 3777 my 3450 Father 3962: if 1487 ye had known 1492 5715 me 1691, 2532 ye should have known 1492 5715 my 3450 Father 3962 also 30 . 

8:20 These 5023 words 4487 spake 2980 5656 Jesus 2424 in 1722 the treasury 1049, as he taught 1321 5723 in 1722 the temple 2411: and 2532 no man 3762 laid hands 4084 5656 on him 846; for 3754 his 846 hour 5610 was 2064 0 not yet 3768 come 2064 5715. 

8:21 Then 3767 said 2036 5627 Jesus 2424 again 3825 unto them 846, I 1473 go my way 5217 5719, and 2532 ye shall seek 2212 5692 me 3165, and 2532 shall die 599 5695 in 1722 your 5216 sins 266: whither 3699 I 1473 go 5217 5719, ye 5210 cannot 3756 1410 5736 come 2064 5629. 

8:22 Then 3767 said 3004 5707 the Jews 2453, Will he kill 3385 615 5692 himself 1438? because 3754 he saith 3004 5719, Whither 3699 I 1473 go 5217 5719, ye 5210 cannot 3756 1410 5736 come 2064 5629. 

8:23 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Ye 5210 are 2075 5748 from 1537 beneath 2736; I 1473 am 1510 5748 from 1537 above 507: ye 5210 are 2075 5748 of 1537 this 5127 world 2889; I 1473 am 1510 5748 not 3756 of 1537 this 5127 world 2889. 

8:24 I said 2036 5627 therefore 3767 unto you 5213, that 3754 ye shall die 599 5695 in 1722 your 5216 sins 266: for 1063 if 3362 0 ye believe 4100 5661 not 3362 that 3754 I 1473 am 1510 5748 [he], ye shall die 599 5695 in 1722 your 5216 sins 266. 

8:25 Then 3767 said they 3004 5707 unto him 846, Who 5101 art 1488 5748 thou 4771? And 2532 Jesus 2424 saith 2036 5627 unto them 846, Even 3748 2532 [the same] that I said 2980 5719 unto you 5213 from the beginning 746. 

8:26 I have 2192 5719 many things 4183 to say 2980 5721 and 2532 to judge 2919 5721 of 4012 you 5216: but 235 he that sent 3992 5660 me 3165 is 2076 5748 true 227; and I 2504 speak 3004 5719 to 1519 the world 2889 those things 5023 which 3739 I have heard 191 5656 of 3844 him 846. 

8:27 They understood 1097 5627 not 3756 that 3754 he spake 3004 5707 to them 846 of the Father 3962. 

8:28 Then 5119 said 2036 5627 Jesus 2424 unto them 846, When 3752 ye have lifted up 5312 5661 the Son 5207 of man 444, then 3767 shall ye know 1097 5695 that 3754 I 1473 am 1510 5748 [he], and 2532 [that] I do 4160 5719 nothing 3762 of 575 myself 1683; but 235 as 2531 my 3450 Father 3962 hath taught 1321 5656 me 3165, I speak 2980 5719 these things 5023. 

8:29 And 2532 he that sent 3992 5660 me 3165 is 2076 5748 with 3326 me 1700: the Father 3962 hath 863 0 not 3756 left 863 5656 me 3165 alone 3441; for 3754 I 1473 do 4160 5719 always 3842 those things that please 701 him 846. 

8:30 As he spake 2980 5723 these words 5023, many 4183 believed 4100 5656 on 1519 him 846. 

8:31 Then 3767 said 3004 5707 Jesus 2424 to 4314 those Jews 2453 which 3588 believed 4100 5761 on him 846, If 1437 ye 5210 continue 3306 5661 in 1722 my 1699 word 3056, [then] are ye 2075 5748 my 3450 disciples 3101 indeed 230; 

8:32 And 2532 ye shall know 1097 5695 the truth 225, and 2532 the truth 225 shall make 1659 0 you 5209 free 1659 5692. 

8:33 They answered 611 5662 him 846, We be 2070 5748 Abraham's 11 seed 4690, and 2532 were 1398 0 never 4455 in bondage 1398 5758 to any man 3762: how 4459 sayest 3004 5719 thou 4771, 3754 Ye shall be made 1096 5695 free 1658? 

8:34 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 them 846, Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, 3754 Whosoever 3956 committeth 4160 5723 sin 266 is 2076 5748 the servant 1401 of sin 266. 

8:35 And 1161 the servant 1401 abideth 3306 5719 not 3756 in 1722 the house 3614 for 1519 ever 165: [but] the Son 5207 abideth 3306 5719 1519 ever 165. 

8:36 If 1437 the Son 5207 therefore 3767 shall make 1659 0 you 5209 free 1659 5661, ye shall be 2071 5704 free 1658 indeed 3689. 

8:37 I know 1492 5758 that 3754 ye are 2075 5748 Abraham's 11 seed 4690; but 235 ye seek 2212 5719 to kill 615 5658 me 3165, because 3754 my 1699 word 3056 hath 5562 0 no 3756 place 5562 5719 in 1722 you 5213. 

8:38 I 1473 speak 2980 5719 that which 3739 I have seen 3708 5758 with 3844 my 3450 Father 3962: and 2532 ye 5210 do 4160 5719 that 3767 which 3739 ye have seen 3708 5758 with 3844 your 5216 father 3962. 

8:39 They answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Abraham 11 is 2076 5748 our 2257 father 3962. Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, If 1487 ye were 2258 5713 Abraham's 11 children 5043, ye would do 4160 5707 302 the works 2041 of Abraham 11. 

8:40 But 1161 now 3568 ye seek 2212 5719 to kill 615 5658 me 3165, a man 444 that 3739 hath told 2980 5758 you 5213 the truth 225, which 3739 I have heard 191 5656 of 3844 God 2316: this 5124 did 4160 5656 not 3756 Abraham 11. 

8:41 Ye 5210 do 4160 5719 the deeds 2041 of your 5216 father 3962. Then 3767 said they 2036 5627 to him 846, We 2249 be 1080 0 not 3756 born 1080 5769 of 1537 fornication 4202; we have 2192 5719 one 1520 Father 3962, [even] God 2316. 

8:42 Jesus 2424 3767 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, If 1487 God 2316 were 2258 5713 your 5216 Father 3962, ye would 302 love 25 5707 me 1691: for 1063 I 1473 proceeded forth 1831 5627 and 2532 came 2240 5719 from 1537 God 2316; neither 3761 1063 came I 2064 5754 of 575 myself 1683, but 235 he 1565 sent 649 5656 me 3165. 

8:43 Why 1302 do ye 1097 0 not 3756 understand 1097 5719 my 1699 speech 2981? [even] because 3754 ye cannot 3756 1410 5736 hear 191 5721 my 1699 word 3056. 

8:44 Ye 5210 are 2075 5748 of 1537 [your] father 3962 the devil 1228, and 2532 the lusts 1939 of your 5216 father 3962 ye will 2309 5719 do 4160 5721. He 1565 was 2258 5713 a murderer 443 from 575 the beginning 746, and 2532 abode 2476 5707 5758 not 3756 in 1722 the truth 225, because 3754 there is 2076 5748 no 3756 truth 225 in 1722 him 846. When 3752 he speaketh 2980 5725 a lie 5579, he speaketh 2980 5719 of 1537 his own 2398: for 3754 he is 2076 5748 a liar 5583, and 2532 the father 3962 of it 846. 

8:45 And 1161 because 3754 I 1473 tell 3004 5719 [you] the truth 225, ye believe 4100 5719 me 3427 not 3756. 

8:46 Which 5101 of 1537 you 5216 convinceth 1651 5719 me 3165 of 4012 sin 266? And 1161 if 1487 I say 3004 5719 the truth 225, why 1302 do 4100 0 ye 5210 not 3756 believe 4100 5719 me 3427? 

8:47 He that is 5607 5752 of 1537 God 2316 heareth 191 5719 God's 2316 words 4487: ye 5210 therefore 5124 1223 hear 191 5719 [them] not 3756, because 3754 ye are 2075 5748 not 3756 of 1537 God 2316. 

8:48 Then 3767 answered 611 5662 the Jews 2453, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Say 3004 5719 we 2249 not 3756 well 2573 that 3754 thou 4771 art 1488 5748 a Samaritan 4541, and 2532 hast 2192 5719 a devil 1140? 

8:49 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662, I 1473 have 2192 5719 not 3756 a devil 1140; but 235 I honour 5091 5719 my 3450 Father 3962, and 2532 ye 5210 do dishonour 818 5719 me 3165. 

8:50 And 1161 I 1473 seek 2212 5719 not 3756 mine own 3450 glory 1391: there is 2076 5748 one that seeketh 2212 5723 and 2532 judgeth 2919 5723. 

8:51 Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, If 1437 a man 5100 keep 5083 5661 my 1699 saying 3056, he shall 2334 0 never 3364 1519 165 see 2334 5661 death 2288. 

8:52 Then 3767 said 2036 5627 the Jews 2453 unto him 846, Now 3568 we know 1097 5758 that 3754 thou hast 2192 5719 a devil 1140. Abraham 11 is dead 599 5627, and 2532 the prophets 4396; and 2532 thou 4771 sayest 3004 5719, If 1437 a man 5100 keep 5083 5661 my 3450 saying 3056, he shall 1089 0 never 3364 1519 165 taste 1089 5695 of death 2288. 

8:53 Art 3361 1488 5748 thou 4771 greater than 3187 our 2257 father 3962 Abraham 11, which 3748 is dead 599 5627? and 2532 the prophets 4396 are dead 599 5627: whom 5101 makest 4160 5719 thou 4771 thyself 4572? 

8:54 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662, If 1437 I 1473 honour 1392 5719 myself 1683, my 3450 honour 1391 is 2076 5748 nothing 3762: it is 2076 5748 my 3450 Father 3962 that 3739 honoureth 1392 5723 me 3165; of whom 3739 ye 5210 say 3004 5719, that 3754 he is 2076 5748 your 5216 God 2316: 

8:55 Yet 2532 ye have 1097 0 not 3756 known 1097 5758 him 846; but 1161 I 1473 know 1492 5758 him 846: and 2532 if 1437 I should say 2036 5632, 3754 I know 1492 5758 him 846 not 3756, I shall be 2071 5704 a liar 5583 like 3664 unto you 5216: but 235 I know 1492 5758 him 846, and 2532 keep 5083 5719 his 846 saying 3056. 

8:56 Your 5216 father 3962 Abraham 11 rejoiced 21 5662 to 2443 see 1492 5632 my 1699 day 2250: and 2532 he saw 1492 5627 [it], and 2532 was glad 5463 5644. 

8:57 Then 3767 said 2036 5627 the Jews 2453 unto 4314 him 846, Thou art 2192 5719 not yet 3768 fifty 4004 years old 2094, and 2532 hast thou seen 3708 5758 Abraham 11? 

8:58 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Before 4250 Abraham 11 was 1096 5635, I 1473 am 1510 5748. 

8:59 Then 3767 took they up 142 5656 stones 3037 to 2443 cast 906 5632 at 1909 him 846: but 1161 Jesus 2424 hid himself 2928 5648, and 2532 went 1831 5627 out of 1537 the temple 2411, going 1330 5631 through 1223 the midst 3319 of them 846, and 2532 so 3779 passed by 3855 5707. 

9:1 And 2532 as [Jesus] passed by 3855 5723, he saw 1492 5627 a man 444 which was blind 5185 from 1537 [his] birth 1079. 

9:2 And 2532 his 846 disciples 3101 asked 2065 5656 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Master 4461, who 5101 did sin 264 5627, this man 3778, or 2228 his 846 parents 1118, that 2443 he was born 1080 5686 blind 5185? 

9:3 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662, Neither 3777 hath 264 0 this man 3778 sinned 264 5627, nor 3777 his 846 parents 1118: but 235 that 2443 the works 2041 of God 2316 should be made manifest 5319 5686 in 1722 him 846. 

9:4 I 1691 must 1163 5748 work 2038 5738 the works 2041 of him that sent 3992 5660 me 3165, while 2193 it is 2076 5748 day 2250: the night 3571 cometh 2064 5736, when 3753 no man 3762 can 1410 5736 work 2038 5738. 

9:5 As long as 3752 I am 5600 5753 in 1722 the world 2889, I am 1510 5748 the light 5457 of the world 2889. 

9:6 When he had thus 5023 spoken 2036 5631, he spat 4429 5656 on the ground 5476, and 2532 made 4160 5656 clay 4081 of 1537 the spittle 4427, and 2532 he anointed 2025 5656 1909 the eyes 3788 of the blind man 5185 with the clay 4081, 

9:7 And 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Go 5217 5720, wash 3538 5669 in 1519 the pool 2861 of Siloam 4611, (which 3739 is by interpretation 2059 5743, Sent 649 5772) He went his way 565 5627 therefore 3767, and 2532 washed 3538 5668, and 2532 came 2064 5627 seeing 991 5723. 

9:8 The neighbours 1069 therefore 3767, and 2532 they which before 4386 had seen 2334 5723 him 846 that 3754 he was 2258 5713 blind 5185, said 3004 5707, Is 2076 5748 not 3756 this 3778 he that sat 2521 5740 and 2532 begged 4319 5723? 

9:9 Some 243 said 3004 5707, 3754 This 3778 is he 2076 5748: 1161 others 243 [said], 3754 He is 2076 5748 like 3664 him 846: [but] he 1565 said 3004 5707, 3754 I 1473 am 1510 5748 [he]. 

9:10 Therefore 3767 said they 3004 5707 unto him 846, How 4459 were 455 0 thine 4675 eyes 3788 opened 455 5681? 

9:11 He 1565 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627, A man 444 that is called 3004 5746 Jesus 2424 made 4160 5656 clay 4081, and 2532 anointed 2025 5656 mine 3450 eyes 3788, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto me 3427, Go 5217 5720 to 1519 the pool 2861 of Siloam 4611, and 2532 wash 3538 5669: and 1161 I went 565 5631 and 2532 washed 3538 5671, and I received sight 308 5656. 

9:12 Then 3767 said they 2036 5627 unto him 846, Where 4226 is 2076 5748 he 1565? He said 3004 5719, I know 1492 5758 not 3756. 

9:13 They brought 71 5719 to 4314 the Pharisees 5330 him 846 that aforetime 4218 was blind 5185. 

9:14 And 1161 it was 2258 5713 the sabbath day 4521 when 3753 Jesus 2424 made 4160 5656 the clay 4081, and 2532 opened 455 5656 his 846 eyes 3788. 

9:15 Then 3767 again 3825 the Pharisees 5330 also 2532 asked 2065 5707 him 846 how 4459 he had received his sight 308 5656. 1161 He said 2036 5627 unto them 846, He put 2007 5656 clay 4081 upon 1909 mine 3450 eyes 3788, and 2532 I washed 3538 5668, and 2532 do see 991 5719. 

9:16 Therefore 3767 said 3004 5707 some 5100 of 1537 the Pharisees 5330, This 3778 man 444 is 2076 5748 not 3756 of 3844 God 2316, because 3754 he keepeth 5083 5719 not 3756 the sabbath day 4521. Others 243 said 3004 5707, How 4459 can 1410 5736 a man 444 that is a sinner 268 do 4160 5721 such 5108 miracles 4592? And 2532 there was 2258 5713 a division 4978 among 1722 them 846. 

9:17 They say 3004 5719 unto the blind man 5185 again 3825, What 5101 sayest 3004 5719 thou 4771 of 4012 him 846, that 3754 he hath opened 455 5656 thine 4675 eyes 3788? He said 2036 5627, 3754 1161 He is 2076 5748 a prophet 4396. 

9:18 But 3767 the Jews 2453 did 4100 0 not 3756 believe 4100 5656 concerning 4012 him 846, that 3754 he had been 2258 5713 blind 5185, and 2532 received his sight 308 5656, until 2193 3755 they called 5455 5656 the parents 1118 of him 846 that had received his sight 308 5660. 

9:19 And 2532 they asked 2065 5656 them 846, saying 3004 5723, Is 2076 5748 this 3778 your 5216 son 5207, who 3739 ye 5210 say 3004 5719 3754 was born 1080 5681 blind 5185? how 4459 then 3767 doth he 991 0 now 737 see 991 5719? 

9:20 His 846 parents 1118 answered 611 5662 them 846 and 2532 said 2036 5627, We know 1492 5758 that 3754 this 3778 is 2076 5748 our 2257 son 5207, and 2532 that 3754 he was born 1080 5681 blind 5185: 

9:21 But 1161 by what means 4459 he 991 0 now 3568 seeth 991 5719, we know 1492 5758 not 3756; or 2228 who 5101 hath opened 455 5656 his 846 eyes 3788, we 2249 know 1492 5758 not 3756: he 846 is 2192 5719 of age 2244; ask him 2065 5657: he 846 shall speak 2980 5692 for 4012 himself 848. 

9:22 These 5023 [words] spake 2036 5627 his 846 parents 1118, because 3754 they feared 5399 5711 the Jews 2453: for 1063 the Jews 2453 had agreed 4934 5717 already 2235, that 2443 if 1437 any man 5100 did confess 3670 5661 that he 846 was Christ 5547, he should be 1096 5638 put out of the synagogue 656. 

9:23 Therefore 1223 5124 said 2036 5627 his 846 parents 1118, 3754 He is 2192 5719 of age 2244; ask 2065 5657 him 846. 

9:24 Then 3767 again 1208 1537 called they 5455 5656 the man 444 that 3739 was 2258 5713 blind 5185, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Give 1325 5628 God 2316 the praise 1391: we 2249 know 1492 5758 that 3754 this 3778 man 444 is 2076 5748 a sinner 268. 

9:25 3767 He 1565 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627, Whether 1487 he be 2076 5748 a sinner 268 [or no], I know 1492 5758 not 3756: one thing 1520 I know 1492 5758, that 3754, whereas I was 5607 5752 blind 5185, now 737 I see 991 5719. 

9:26 Then 1161 said they 2036 5627 to him 846 again 3825, What 5101 did he 4160 5656 to thee 4671? how 4459 opened he 455 5656 thine 4675 eyes 3788? 

9:27 He answered 611 5662 them 846, I have told 2036 5627 you 5213 already 2235, and 2532 ye did 191 0 not 3756 hear 191 5656: wherefore 5101 would 2309 5719 ye hear 191 5721 [it] again 3825? will 3361 2309 5719 ye 5210 also 2532 be 1096 5635 his 846 disciples 3101? 

9:28 Then 3767 they reviled 3058 5656 him 846, and 2532 said 2036 5627, Thou 4771 art 1488 5748 his 1565 disciple 3101; but 1161 we 2249 are 2070 5748 Moses 3475' disciples 3101. 

9:29 We 2249 know 1492 5758 that 3754 God 2316 spake 2980 5758 unto Moses 3475: [as for] this 1161 5126 [fellow], we know 1492 5758 not 3756 from whence 4159 he is 2076 5748. 

9:30 The man 444 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Why 1063 herein 1722 5129 is 2076 5748 a marvellous thing 2298, that 3754 ye 5210 know 1492 5758 not 3756 from whence 4159 he is 2076 5748, and 2532 [yet] he hath opened 455 5656 mine 3450 eyes 3788. 

9:31 Now 1161 we know 1492 5758 that 3754 God 2316 heareth 191 5719 not 3756 sinners 268: but 235 if 1437 any man 5100 be 5600 5753 a worshipper of God 2318, and 2532 doeth 4160 5725 his 846 will 2307, him 5127 he heareth 191 5719. 

9:32 Since 1537 the world began 165 was it 191 0 not 3756 heard 191 5681 that 3754 any man 5100 opened 455 5656 the eyes 3788 of one that was born 1080 5772 blind 5185. 

9:33 If 1508 0 this man 3778 were 2258 5713 not 1508 of 3844 God 2316, he could 1410 5711 3756 do 4160 5721 nothing 3762. 

9:34 They answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Thou 4771 wast 1080 0 altogether 3650 born 1080 5681 in 1722 sins 266, and 2532 dost thou 4771 teach 1321 5719 us 2248? And 2532 they cast 1544 5627 him 846 out 1854. 

9:35 Jesus 2424 heard 191 5656 that 3754 they had cast 1544 5627 him 846 out 1854; and 2532 when he had found 2147 5631 him 846, he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Dost 4100 0 thou 4771 believe 4100 5719 on 1519 the Son 5207 of God 2316? 

9:36 He 1565 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627, Who 5101 is he 2076 5748, Lord 2962, that 2443 I might believe 4100 5661 on 1519 him 846? 

9:37 And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Thou hast 3708 0 both 2532 seen 3708 5758 him 846, and 2532 it is 2076 5748 he 1565 that talketh 2980 5723 with 3326 thee 4675. 

9:38 And 1161 he said 5346 5713, Lord 2962, I believe 4100 5719. And 2532 he worshipped 4352 5656 him 846. 

9:39 And 2532 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627, For 1519 judgment 2917 I 1473 am come 2064 5627 into 1519 this 5126 world 2889, that 2443 they which see 991 5723 not 3361 might see 991 5725; and 2532 that they which see 991 5723 might be made 1096 5638 blind 5185. 

9:40 And 2532 [some] of 1537 the Pharisees 5330 which 3588 were 5607 5752 with 3326 him 846 heard 191 5656 these words 5023, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Are 3361 2070 5748 we 2249 blind 5185 also 2532? 

9:41 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, If 1487 ye were 2258 5713 blind 5185, ye should 302 have 2192 5707 no 3756 sin 266: but 1161 now 3568 ye say 3004 5719, 3754 We see 991 5719; therefore 3767 your 5216 sin 266 remaineth 3306 5719. 

10:1 Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, He that entereth 1525 5740 not 3361 by 1223 the door 2374 into 1519 the sheepfold 4263 833, but 235 climbeth up 305 5723 some other way 237, the same 1565 is 2076 5748 a thief 2812 and 2532 a robber 3027. 

10:2 But 1161 he that entereth in 1525 5740 by 1223 the door 2374 is 2076 5748 the shepherd 4166 of the sheep 4263. 

10:3 To him 5129 the porter 2377 openeth 455 5719; and 2532 the sheep 4263 hear 191 5719 his 846 voice 5456: and 2532 he calleth 2564 5719 his own 2398 sheep 4263 by 2596 name 3686, and 2532 leadeth 1806 0 them 846 out 1806 5719. 

10:4 And 2532 when 3752 he putteth forth 1544 5632 his own 2398 sheep 4263, he goeth 4198 5736 before 1715 them 846, and 2532 the sheep 4263 follow 190 5719 him 846: for 3754 they know 1492 5758 his 846 voice 5456. 

10:5 And 1161 a stranger 245 will they 190 0 not 3364 follow 190 5661, but 235 will flee 5343 5695 from 575 him 846: for 3754 they know 1492 5758 not 3756 the voice 5456 of strangers 245. 

10:6 This 5026 parable 3942 spake 2036 5627 Jesus 2424 unto them 846: but 1161 they 1565 understood 1097 5627 not 3756 what things 5101 they were 2258 5713 which 3739 he spake 2980 5707 unto them 846. 

10:7 Then 3767 said 2036 5627 Jesus 2424 unto them 846 again 3825, Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, 3754 I 1473 am 1510 5748 the door 2374 of the sheep 4263. 

10:8 All 3956 that ever 3745 came 2064 5627 before 4253 me 1700 are 1526 5748 thieves 2812 and 2532 robbers 3027: but 235 the sheep 4263 did 191 0 not 3756 hear 191 5656 them 846. 

10:9 I 1473 am 1510 5748 the door 2374: by 1223 me 1700 if 1437 any man 5100 enter in 1525 5632, he shall be saved 4982 5701, and 2532 shall go in 1525 5695 and 2532 out 1831 5695, and 2532 find 2147 5692 pasture 3542. 

10:10 The thief 2812 cometh 2064 5736 not 3756, but 1508 for to 2443 steal 2813 5661, and 2532 to kill 2380 5661, and 2532 to destroy 622 5661: I 1473 am come 2064 5627 that 2443 they might have 2192 5725 life 2222, and 2532 that they might have 2192 5725 [it] more abundantly 4053. 

10:11 I 1473 am 1510 5748 the good 2570 shepherd 4166: the good 2570 shepherd 4166 giveth 5087 5719 his 848 life 5590 for 5228 the sheep 4263. 

10:12 But 1161 he that is 5607 5752 an hireling 3411, and 2532 not 3756 the shepherd 4166, whose 3739 own 2398 the sheep 4263 are 1526 5748 not 3756, seeth 2334 5719 the wolf 3074 coming 2064 5740, and 2532 leaveth 863 5719 the sheep 4263, and 2532 fleeth 5343 5719: and 2532 the wolf 3074 catcheth 726 5719 them 846, and 2532 scattereth 4650 5719 the sheep 4263. 

10:13 1161 The hireling 3411 fleeth 5343 5719, because 3754 he is 2076 5748 an hireling 3411, and 2532 careth 3199 5719 not 3756 for 4012 the sheep 4263. 

10:14 I 1473 am 1510 5748 the good 2570 shepherd 4166, and 2532 know 1097 5719 my 1699 [sheep], and 2532 am known 1097 5743 of 5259 mine 1699. 

10:15 As 2531 the Father 3962 knoweth 1097 5719 me 3165, even so 2504 0 know 1097 5719 I 2504 the Father 3962: and 2532 I lay down 5087 5719 my 3450 life 5590 for 5228 the sheep 4263. 

10:16 And 2532 other 243 sheep 4263 I have 2192 5719, which 3739 are 2076 5748 not 3756 of 1537 this 5026 fold 833: them also 2548 I 3165 must 1163 5748 bring 71 5629, and 2532 they shall hear 191 5692 my 3450 voice 5456; and 2532 there shall be 1096 5695 one 3391 fold 4167, [and] one 1520 shepherd 4166. 

10:17 Therefore 5124 1223 doth 25 0 my Father 3962 love 25 5719 me 3165, because 3754 I 1473 lay down 5087 5719 my 3450 life 5590, that 2443 I might take 2983 5632 it 846 again 3825. 

10:18 No man 3762 taketh 142 5719 it 846 from 575 me 1700, but 235 I 1473 lay 5087 0 it 846 down 5087 5719 of 575 myself 1683. I have 2192 5719 power 1849 to lay 5087 0 it 846 down 5087 5629, and 2532 I have 2192 5719 power 1849 to take 2983 5629 it 846 again 3825. This 5026 commandment 1785 have I received 2983 5627 of 3844 my 3450 Father 3962. 

10:19 There was 1096 5633 a division 4978 therefore 3767 again 3825 among 1722 the Jews 2453 for 1223 these 5128 sayings 3056. 

10:20 And 1161 many 4183 of 1537 them 846 said 3004 5707, He hath 2192 5719 a devil 1140, and 2532 is mad 3105 5736; why 5101 hear ye 191 5719 him 846? 

10:21 Others 243 said 3004 5707, These 5023 are 2076 5748 not 3756 the words 4487 of him that hath a devil 1139 5740. Can 3361 1410 5736 a devil 1140 open 455 5721 the eyes 3788 of the blind 5185? 

10:22 And 1161 it was 1096 5633 at 1722 Jerusalem 2414 the feast of the dedication 1456, and 2532 it was 2258 5713 winter 5494. 

10:23 And 2532 Jesus 2424 walked 4043 5707 in 1722 the temple 2411 in 1722 Solomon's 4672 porch 4745. 

10:24 Then 3767 came 2944 0 the Jews 2453 round about 2944 5656 him 846, and 2532 said 3004 5707 unto him 846, How long 2193 4219 dost thou make 142 5719 us 2257 to doubt 5590? If 1487 thou 4771 be 1488 5748 the Christ 5547, tell 2036 5628 us 2254 plainly 3954. 

10:25 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 them 846, I told 2036 5627 you 5213, and 2532 ye believed 4100 5719 not 3756: the works 2041 that 3739 I 1473 do 4160 5719 in 1722 my 3450 Father's 3962 name 3686, they 5023 bear witness 3140 5719 of 4012 me 1700. 

10:26 But 235 ye 5210 believe 4100 5719 not 3756, because 1063 ye are 2075 5748 not 3756 of 1537 my 1699 sheep 4263, as 2531 I said 2036 5627 unto you 5213. 

10:27 My 1699 sheep 4263 hear 191 5719 my 3450 voice 5456, and I 2504 know 1097 5719 them 846, and 2532 they follow 190 5719 me 3427: 

10:28 And I 2504 give 1325 5719 unto them 846 eternal 166 life 2222; and 2532 they shall 622 0 never 3364 1519 165 perish 622 5643, neither 2532 3756 shall 726 0 any 5100 [man] pluck 726 5692 them 846 out of 1537 my 3450 hand 5495. 

10:29 My 3450 Father 3962, which 3739 gave 1325 5758 [them] me 3427, is 2076 5748 greater than 3187 all 3956; and 2532 no 3762 [man] is able 1410 5736 to pluck 726 5721 [them] out of 1537 my 3450 Father's 3962 hand 5495. 

10:30 I 1473 and 2532 [my] Father 3962 are 2070 5748 one 1520. 

10:31 Then 3767 the Jews 2453 took up 941 5656 stones 3037 again 3825 to 2443 stone 3034 5661 him 846. 

10:32 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 them 846, Many 4183 good 2570 works 2041 have I shewed 1166 5656 you 5213 from 1537 my 3450 Father 3962; for 1223 which 4169 of those 846 works 2041 do ye stone 3034 5719 me 3165? 

10:33 The Jews 2453 answered 611 5662 him 846, saying 3004 5723, For 4012 a good 2570 work 2041 we stone 3034 5719 thee 4571 not 3756; but 235 for 4012 blasphemy 988; and 2532 because 3754 that thou 4771, being 5607 5752 a man 444, makest 4160 5719 thyself 4572 God 2316. 

10:34 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 them 846, Is it 2076 5748 not 3756 written 1125 5772 in 1722 your 5216 law 3551, I 1473 said 2036 5656, Ye are 2075 5748 gods 2316? 

10:35 If 1487 he called 2036 5627 them 1565 gods 2316, unto 4314 whom 3739 the word 3056 of God 2316 came 1096 5633, and 2532 the scripture 1124 cannot 3756 1410 5736 be broken 3089 5683; 

10:36 Say 3004 5719 ye 5210 of him, whom 3739 the Father 3962 hath sanctified 37 5656, and 2532 sent 649 5656 into 1519 the world 2889, 3754 Thou blasphemest 987 5719; because 3754 I said 2036 5627, I am 1510 5748 the Son 5207 of God 2316? 

10:37 If 1487 I do 4160 5719 not 3756 the works 2041 of my 3450 Father 3962, believe 4100 5720 me 3427 not 3361. 

10:38 But 1161 if 1487 I do 4160 5719, though 2579 ye believe 4100 5725 not 3361 me 1698, believe 4100 5657 the works 2041: that 2443 ye may know 1097 5632, and 2532 believe 4100 5661, that 3754 the Father 3962 [is] in 1722 me 1698, and I 2504 in 1722 him 846. 

10:39 Therefore 3767 they sought 2212 5707 again 3825 to take 4084 5658 him 846: but 2532 he escaped 1831 5627 out of 1537 their 846 hand 5495, 

10:40 And 2532 went away 565 5627 again 3825 beyond 4008 Jordan 2446 into 1519 the place 5117 where 3699 John 2491 at first 4412 baptized 907 5723 2258 5713; and 2532 there 1563 he abode 3306 5656. 

10:41 And 2532 many 4183 resorted 2064 5627 unto 4314 him 846, and 2532 said 3004 5707, 3754 John 2491 did 4160 5656 no 3303 3762 miracle 4592: but 1161 all things 3956 that 3745 John 2491 spake 2036 5627 of 4012 this man 5127 were 2258 5713 true 227. 

10:42 And 2532 many 4183 believed 4100 5656 on 1519 him 846 there 1563. 

11:1 Now 1161 a certain 5100 [man] was 2258 5713 sick 770 5723, [named] Lazarus 2976, of 575 Bethany 963, 1537 the town 2968 of Mary 3137 and 2532 her 846 sister 79 Martha 3136. 

11:2 1161 (It was 2258 5713 [that] Mary 3137 which 3588 anointed 218 5660 the Lord 2962 with ointment 3464, and 2532 wiped 1591 5660 his 846 feet 4228 with her 848 hair 2359, whose 3739 brother 80 Lazarus 2976 was sick 770 5707) 

11:3 Therefore 3767 his sisters 79 sent 649 5656 unto 4314 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962, behold 2396, he whom 3739 thou lovest 5368 5719 is sick 770 5719. 

11:4 When 1161 Jesus 2424 heard 191 5660 [that], he said 2036 5627, This 3778 sickness 769 is 2076 5748 not 3756 unto 4314 death 2288, but 235 for 5228 the glory 1391 of God 2316, that 2443 the Son 5207 of God 2316 might be glorified 1392 5686 thereby 1223 846. 

11:5 Now 1161 Jesus 2424 loved 25 5707 Martha 3136, and 2532 her 846 sister 79, and 2532 Lazarus 2976. 

11:6 When 5613 he had heard 191 5656 therefore 3767 that 3754 he was sick 770 5719, he abode 3306 5656 two 1417 days 2250 still 5119 3303 in 1722 the same place 5117 where 3739 he was 2258 5713. 

11:7 Then 1899 after 3326 that 5124 saith he 3004 5719 to [his] disciples 3101, Let us go 71 5725 into 1519 Judaea 2449 again 3825. 

11:8 [His] disciples 3101 say 3004 5719 unto him 846, Master 4461, the Jews 2453 of late 3568 sought 2212 5707 to stone 3034 5658 thee 4571; and 2532 goest thou 5217 5719 thither 1563 again 3825? 

11:9 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662, Are there 1526 5748 not 3780 twelve 1427 hours 5610 in the day 2250? If 1437 any man 5100 walk 4043 5725 in 1722 the day 2250, he stumbleth 4350 5719 not 3756, because 3754 he seeth 991 5719 the light 5457 of this 5127 world 2889. 

11:10 But 1161 if 1437 a man 5100 walk 4043 5725 in 1722 the night 3571, he stumbleth 4350 5719, because 3754 there is 2076 5748 no 3756 light 5457 in 1722 him 846. 

11:11 These things 5023 said 2036 5627 he 846: and 2532 after 3326 that 5124 he saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Our 2257 friend 5384 Lazarus 2976 sleepeth 2837 5769; but 235 I go 4198 5736, that 2443 I may awake 1852 0 him 846 out of sleep 1852 5661. 

11:12 Then 3767 said 2036 5627 his 846 disciples 3101, Lord 2962, if 1487 he sleep 2837 5769, he shall do well 4982 5701. 

11:13 Howbeit 1161 Jesus 2424 spake 2046 5715 of 4012 his 846 death 2288: but 1161 they 1565 thought 1380 5656 that 3754 he had spoken 3004 5719 of 4012 taking of rest 2838 in sleep 5258. 

11:14 Then 5119 3767 said 2036 5627 Jesus 2424 unto them 846 plainly 3954, Lazarus 2976 is dead 599 5627. 

11:15 And 2532 I am glad 5463 5719 for 1223 your sakes 5209 that 3754 I was 2252 5713 5625 2258 5713 not 3756 there 1563, to the intent 2443 ye may believe 4100 5661; nevertheless 235 let us go 71 5725 unto 4314 him 846. 

11:16 Then 3767 said 2036 5627 Thomas 2381, which 3588 is called 3004 5746 Didymus 1324, unto his fellowdisciples 4827, Let us 71 0 also 2532 go 71 5725, that 2443 we 2249 may die 599 5632 with 3326 him 846. 

11:17 Then 3767 when Jesus 2424 came 2064 5631, he found 2147 5627 that he 846 had 2192 5723 [lain] in 1722 the grave 3419 four 5064 days 2250 already 2235. 

11:18 Now 1161 Bethany 963 was 2258 5713 nigh 1451 unto Jerusalem 2414, about 5613 fifteen 1178 furlongs 4712 off 575: 

11:19 And 2532 many 4183 of 1537 the Jews 2453 came 2064 5715 to 4314 Martha 3136 and 2532 Mary 3137 4012, to 2443 comfort 3888 5667 them 846 concerning 4012 their 846 brother 80. 

11:20 Then 3767 Martha 3136, as soon as 5613 she heard 191 5656 that 3754 Jesus 2424 was coming 2064 5736, went and met 5221 5656 him 846: but 1161 Mary 3137 sat 2516 5711 [still] in 1722 the house 3624. 

11:21 Then 3767 said 2036 5627 Martha 3136 unto 4314 Jesus 2424, Lord 2962, if 1487 thou hadst been 2258 5713 here 5602, my 3450 brother 80 302 had 2348 0 not 3756 died 2348 5715. 

11:22 But 235 I know 1492 5758, that even 2532 now 3568, whatsoever 3754 3745 302 thou wilt ask 154 5672 of God 2316, God 2316 will give 1325 5692 [it] thee 4671. 

11:23 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto her 846, Thy 4675 brother 80 shall rise again 450 5698. 

11:24 Martha 3136 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, I know 1492 5758 that 3754 he shall rise again 450 5698 in 1722 the resurrection 386 at 1722 the last 2078 day 2250. 

11:25 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto her 846, I 1473 am 1510 5748 the resurrection 386, and 2532 the life 2222: he that believeth 4100 5723 in 1519 me 1691, though 2579 he were dead 599 5632, yet shall he live 2198 5695: 

11:26 And 2532 whosoever 3956 liveth 2198 5723 and 2532 believeth 4100 5723 in 1519 me 1691 shall 599 0 never 3364 165 die 599 5632. Believest thou 4100 5719 this 5124? 

11:27 She saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Yea 3483, Lord 2962: I 1473 believe 4100 5758 that 3754 thou 4771 art 1488 5748 the Christ 5547, the Son 5207 of God 2316, which 3588 should come 2064 5740 into 1519 the world 2889. 

11:28 And 2532 when she had 2036 0 so 5023 said 2036 5631, she went her way 565 5627, and 2532 called 5455 5656 Mary 3137 her 848 sister 79 secretly 2977, saying 2036 5631, The Master 1320 is come 3918 5748, and 2532 calleth for 5455 5719 thee 4571. 

11:29 As soon as 5613 she 1565 heard 191 5656 [that], she arose 1453 5743 quickly 5035, and 2532 came 2064 5736 unto 4314 him 846. 

11:30 Now 1161 Jesus 2424 was 2064 0 not yet 3768 come 2064 5715 into 1519 the town 2968, but 235 was 2258 5713 in 1722 that place 5117 where 3699 Martha 3136 met 5221 5656 him 846. 

11:31 The Jews 2453 then 3767 which 3588 were 5607 5752 with 3326 her 846 in 1722 the house 3614, and 2532 comforted 3888 5740 her 846, when they saw 1492 5631 Mary 3137, that 3754 she rose up 450 5627 hastily 5030 and 2532 went out 1831 5627, followed 190 5656 her 846, saying 3004 5723, 3754 She goeth 5217 5719 unto 1519 the grave 3419 to 2443 weep 2799 5661 there 1563. 

11:32 Then 3767 when 5613 Mary 3137 was come 2064 5627 where 3699 Jesus 2424 was 2258 5713, and saw 1492 5631 him 846, she fell down 4098 5627 at 1519 his 846 feet 4228, saying 3004 5723 unto him 846, Lord 2962, if 1487 thou hadst been 2258 5713 here 5602, my 3450 brother 80 had 302 not 3756 died 599 5627. 

11:33 When 5613 Jesus 2424 therefore 3767 saw 1492 5627 her 846 weeping 2799 5723, and 2532 the Jews 2453 also weeping 2799 5723 which came 4905 5631 with her 846, he groaned 1690 5662 in the spirit 4151, and 2532 was troubled 5015 5656 1438, 

11:34 And 2532 said 2036 5627, Where 4226 have ye laid 5087 5758 him 846? They said 3004 5719 unto him 846, Lord 2962, come 2064 5736 and 2532 see 1492 5657. 

11:35 Jesus 2424 wept 1145 5656. 

11:36 Then 3767 said 3004 5707 the Jews 2453, Behold 2396 how 4459 he loved 5368 5707 him 846! 

11:37 And 1161 some 5100 of 1537 them 846 said 2036 5627, Could 1410 5711 not 3756 this man 3778, which 3588 opened 455 5660 the eyes 3788 of the blind 5185, have caused 4160 5658 that 2443 even 2532 this man 3778 should 599 0 not 3361 have died 599 5632? 

11:38 Jesus 2424 therefore 3767 again 3825 groaning 1690 5740 in 1722 himself 1438 cometh 2064 5736 to 1519 the grave 3419. 1161 It was 2258 5713 a cave 4693, and 2532 a stone 3037 lay 1945 5711 upon 1909 it 846. 

11:39 Jesus 2424 said 3004 5719, Take ye away 142 5657 the stone 3037. Martha 3136, the sister 79 of him that was dead 2348 5761, saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Lord 2962, by this time 2235 he stinketh 3605 5719: for 1063 he hath been 2076 5748 [dead] four days 5066. 

11:40 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto her 846, Said I 2036 5627 not 3756 unto thee 4671, that 3754, if 1437 thou wouldest believe 4100 5661, thou shouldest see 3700 5695 the glory 1391 of God 2316? 

11:41 Then 3767 they took away 142 5656 the stone 3037 [from the place] where 3757 the dead 2348 5761 was 2258 5713 laid 2749 5740. And 1161 Jesus 2424 lifted 142 5656 up 507 [his] eyes 3788, and 2532 said 2036 5627, Father 3962, I thank 2168 5719 thee 4671 that 3754 thou hast heard 191 5656 me 3450. 

11:42 And 1161 I 1473 knew 1492 5715 that 3754 thou hearest 191 5719 me 3450 always 3842: but 235 because 1223 of the people 3793 which 3588 stand by 4026 5761 I said 2036 5627 [it], that 2443 they may believe 4100 5661 that 3754 thou 4771 hast sent 649 5656 me 3165. 

11:43 And 2532 when he thus 5023 had spoken 2036 5631, he cried 2905 5656 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, Lazarus 2976, come 1204 5773 forth 1854. 

11:44 And 2532 he that was dead 2348 5761 came forth 1831 5627, bound 1210 5772 hand 5495 and 2532 foot 4228 with graveclothes 2750: and 2532 his 846 face 3799 was bound about 4019 5718 with a napkin 4676. Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Loose 3089 5657 him 846, and 2532 let him 863 5628 go 5217 5721. 

11:45 Then 3767 many 4183 of 1537 the Jews 2453 which 3588 came 2064 5631 to 4314 Mary 3137, and 2532 had seen 2300 5666 the things which 3739 Jesus 2424 did 4160 5656, believed 4100 5656 on 1519 him 846. 

11:46 But 1161 some 5100 of 1537 them 846 went their ways 565 5627 to 4314 the Pharisees 5330, and 2532 told 2036 5627 them 846 what things 3739 Jesus 2424 had done 4160 5656. 

11:47 Then 3767 gathered 4863 5627 the chief priests 749 and 2532 the Pharisees 5330 a council 4892, and 2532 said 3004 5707, What 5101 do we 4160 5719? for 3754 this 3778 man 444 doeth 4160 5719 many 4183 miracles 4592. 

11:48 If 1437 we let 863 0 him 846 thus 3779 alone 863 5632, all 3956 [men] will believe 4100 5692 on 1519 him 846: and 2532 the Romans 4514 shall come 2064 5695 and 2532 take away 142 5692 both 2532 our 2257 place 5117 and 2532 nation 1484. 

11:49 And 1161 one 1520 5100 of 1537 them 846, [named] Caiaphas 2533, being 5607 5752 the high priest 749 that same 1565 year 1763, said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Ye 5210 know 1492 5758 nothing at all 3756 3762, 

11:50 Nor 3761 consider 1260 5736 that 3754 it is expedient 4851 5719 for us 2254, that 2443 one 1520 man 444 should die 599 5632 for 5228 the people 2992, and 2532 that the whole 3650 nation 1484 perish 622 5643 not 3361. 

11:51 And 1161 this 5124 spake he 2036 5627 not 3756 of 575 himself 1438: but 235 being 5607 5752 high priest 749 that 1565 year 1763, he prophesied 4395 5656 that 3754 Jesus 2424 should 3195 5707 die 599 5721 for that 5228 nation 1484; 

11:52 And 2532 not 3756 for that 5228 nation 1484 only 3440, but 235 that 2443 also 2532 he should gather together 4863 5632 in 1519 one 1520 the children 5043 of God 2316 that were scattered abroad 1287 5772. 

11:53 Then 3767 from 575 that 1565 day 2250 forth they took counsel together 4823 5668 for to 2443 put 615 0 him 846 to death 615 5725. 

11:54 Jesus 2424 therefore 3767 walked 4043 5707 no more 2089 3765 openly 3954 among 1722 the Jews 2453; but 235 went 565 5627 thence 1564 unto 1519 a country 5561 near 1451 to the wilderness 2048, into 1519 a city 4172 called 3004 5746 Ephraim 2187, and there 2546 continued 1304 5707 with 3326 his 848 disciples 3101. 

11:55 And 1161 the Jews 2453' passover 3957 was 2258 5713 nigh at hand 1451: and 2532 many 4183 went 305 5627 out of 1537 the country 5561 up 1519 to Jerusalem 2414 before 4253 the passover 3957, to 2443 purify 48 5661 themselves 1438. 

11:56 Then 3767 sought they for 2212 5707 Jesus 2424, and 2532 spake 3004 5707 among 3326 themselves 240, as they stood 2476 5761 in 1722 the temple 2411, What 5101 think 1380 5719 ye 5213, that 3754 he will 2064 0 not 3364 come 2064 5632 to 1519 the feast 1859? 

11:57 Now 1161 both 2532 the chief priests 749 and 2532 the Pharisees 5330 had given 1325 5715 a commandment 1785, that 2443, if 1437 any man 5100 knew 1097 5632 where 4226 he were 2076 5748, he should shew 3377 5661 [it], that 3704 they might take 4084 5661 him 846. 

12:1 Then 3767 Jesus 2424 six 1803 days 2250 before 4253 the passover 3957 came 2064 5627 to 1519 Bethany 963, where 3699 Lazarus 2976 was 2258 5713 which 3588 had been dead 2348 5761, whom 3739 he raised 1453 5656 from 1537 the dead 3498. 

12:2 There 1563 3767 they made 4160 5656 him 846 a supper 1173; and 2532 Martha 3136 served 1247 5707: but 1161 Lazarus 2976 was 2258 5713 one 1520 of them that sat at the table 4873 5740 with him 846. 

12:3 Then 3767 took 2983 5631 Mary 3137 a pound 3046 of ointment 3464 of spikenard 3487 4101, very costly 4186, and anointed 218 5656 the feet 4228 of Jesus 2424, and 2532 wiped 1591 5656 his 846 feet 4228 with her 848 hair 2359: and 1161 the house 3614 was filled 4137 5681 with 1537 the odour 3744 of the ointment 3464. 

12:4 Then 3767 saith 3004 5719 one 1520 of 1537 his 846 disciples 3101, Judas 2455 Iscariot 2469, Simon's 4613 [son], which 3588 should 3195 5723 betray 3860 5721 him 846, 

12:5 Why 1302 was 4097 0 not 3756 this 5124 ointment 3464 sold 4097 5681 for three hundred 5145 pence 1220, and 2532 given 1325 5681 to the poor 4434? 

12:6 1161 This 5124 he said 2036 5627, not 3756 that 3754 he cared 3199 5707 for 4012 the poor 4434; but 235 because 3754 he was 2258 5713 a thief 2812, and 2532 had 2192 5707 the bag 1101, and 2532 bare 941 5707 what was put therein 906 5746. 

12:7 Then 3767 said 2036 5627 Jesus 2424, Let 863 0 her 846 alone 863 5628: against 1519 the day 2250 of my 3450 burying 1780 hath she kept 5083 5758 this 846. 

12:8 For 1063 the poor 4434 always 3842 ye have 2192 5719 with 3326 you 1438; but 1161 me 1691 ye have 2192 5719 not 3756 always 3842. 

12:9 Much 4183 people 3793 of 1537 the Jews 2453 therefore 3767 knew 1097 5627 that 3754 he was 2076 5748 there 1563: and 2532 they came 2064 5627 not 3756 for 1223 Jesus 2424' sake only 3440, but 235 that 2443 they might see 1492 5632 Lazarus 2976 also 2532, whom 3739 he had raised 1453 5656 from 1537 the dead 3498. 

12:10 But 1161 the chief priests 749 consulted 1011 5662 that 2443 they might put 615 0 Lazarus 2976 also 2532 to death 615 5725; 

12:11 Because 3754 that by reason 1223 of him 846 many 4183 of the Jews 2453 went away 5217 5707, and 2532 believed 4100 5707 on 1519 Jesus 2424. 

12:12 On the next day 1887 much 4183 people 3793 that were come 2064 5631 to 1519 the feast 1859, when they heard 191 5660 that 3754 Jesus 2424 was coming 2064 5736 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414, 

12:13 Took 2983 5627 branches 902 of palm trees 5404, and 2532 went forth 1831 5627 to 1519 meet 5222 him 846, and 2532 cried 2896 5707, Hosanna 5614: Blessed 2127 5772 [is] the King 935 of Israel 2474 that cometh 2064 5740 in 1722 the name 3686 of the Lord 2962. 

12:14 And 1161 Jesus 2424, when he had found 2147 5631 a young ass 3678, sat 2523 5656 thereon 1909 846; as 2531 it is 2076 5748 written 1125 5772, 

12:15 Fear 5399 5732 5737 not 3361, daughter 2364 of Sion 4622: behold 2400 5628, thy 4675 King 935 cometh 2064 5736, sitting 2521 5740 on 1909 an ass's 3688 colt 4454. 

12:16 1161 These things 5023 understood 1097 5627 not 3756 his 846 disciples 3101 at the first 4412: but 235 when 3753 Jesus 2424 was glorified 1392 5681, then 5119 remembered they 3415 5681 that 3754 these things 5023 were 2258 5713 written 1125 5772 of 1909 him 846, and 2532 [that] they had done 4160 5656 these things 5023 unto him 846. 

12:17 The people 3793 therefore 3767 that was 5607 5752 with 3326 him 846 when 3753 he called 5455 5656 Lazarus 2976 out of 1537 his grave 3419, and 2532 raised 1453 5656 him 846 from 1537 the dead 3498, bare record 3140 5707. 

12:18 For this 5124 cause 1223 the people 3793 also 2532 met 5221 5656 him 846, for that 3754 they heard 191 5656 that 846 he had done 4160 5760 this 5124 miracle 4592. 

12:19 The Pharisees 5330 therefore 3767 said 2036 5627 among 4314 themselves 1438, Perceive ye 2334 5719 5720 how 3754 ye prevail 5623 5719 nothing 3756 3762? behold 2396, the world 2889 is gone 565 5627 after 3694 him 846. 

12:20 And 1161 there were 2258 5713 certain 5100 Greeks 1672 among 1537 them that came up 305 5723 to 2443 worship 4352 5661 at 1722 the feast 1859: 

12:21 The same 3778 came 4334 5656 therefore 3767 to Philip 5376, which was of 575 Bethsaida 966 of Galilee 1056, and 2532 desired 2065 5707 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Sir 2962, we would 2309 5719 see 1492 5629 Jesus 2424. 

12:22 Philip 5376 cometh 2064 5736 and 2532 telleth 3004 5719 Andrew 406: and 2532 again 3825 Andrew 406 and 2532 Philip 5376 tell 3004 5719 Jesus 2424. 

12:23 And 1161 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 them 846, saying 3004 5723, The hour 5610 is come 2064 5754, that 2443 the Son 5207 of man 444 should be glorified 1392 5686. 

12:24 Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Except 3362 a corn 2848 of wheat 4621 fall 4098 5631 into 1519 the ground 1093 and die 599 5632, it 846 abideth 3306 5719 alone 3441: but 1161 if 1437 it die 599 5632, it bringeth forth 5342 5719 much 4183 fruit 2590. 

12:25 He that loveth 5368 5723 his 848 life 5590 shall lose 622 5692 it 846; and 2532 he that hateth 3404 5723 his 848 life 5590 in 1722 this 5129 world 2889 shall keep 5442 5692 it 846 unto 1519 life 2222 eternal 166. 

12:26 If 1437 any man 5100 serve 1247 5725 me 1698, let him follow 190 5720 me 1698; and 2532 where 3699 I 1473 am 1510 5748, there 1563 shall 2071 0 also 2532 my 1699 servant 1249 be 2071 5704: 2532 if 1437 any man 5100 serve 1247 5725 me 1698, him 846 will 5091 0 [my] Father 3962 honour 5091 5692. 

12:27 Now 3568 is 5015 0 my 3450 soul 5590 troubled 5015 5769; and 2532 what 5101 shall I say 2036 5632? Father 3962, save 4982 5657 me 3165 from 1537 this 5026 hour 5610: but 235 for this 5124 cause 1223 came I 2064 5627 unto 1519 this 5026 hour 5610. 

12:28 Father 3962, glorify 1392 5657 thy 4675 name 3686. Then 3767 came there 2064 5627 a voice 5456 from 1537 heaven 3772, [saying], I have 1392 0 both 2532 glorified 1392 5656 [it], and 2532 will glorify 1392 5692 [it] again 3825. 

12:29 The people 3793 therefore 3767, that stood by 2476 5761, and 2532 heard 191 5660 [it], said 3004 5707 that it thundered 1096 5755 1027: others 243 said 3004 5707, An angel 32 spake 2980 5758 to him 846. 

12:30 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627, This 3778 voice 5456 came 1096 5754 not 3756 because of 1223 me 1691, but 235 for 1223 0 your sakes 5209 1223. 

12:31 Now 3568 is 2076 5748 the judgment 2920 of this 5127 world 2889: now 3568 shall 1544 0 the prince 758 of this 5127 world 2889 be cast 1544 5701 out 1854. 

12:32 And I 2504, if 1437 I be lifted up 5312 5686 from 1537 the earth 1093, will draw 1670 5692 all 3956 [men] unto 4314 me 1683. 

12:33 1161 This 5124 he said 3004 5707, signifying 4591 5723 what 4169 death 2288 he should 3195 5707 die 599 5721. 

12:34 The people 3793 answered 611 5662 him 846, We 2249 have heard 191 5656 out of 1537 the law 3551 that 3754 Christ 5547 abideth 3306 5719 for 1519 ever 165: and 2532 how 4459 sayest 3004 5719 thou 4771, 3754 The Son 5207 of man 444 must 1163 5748 be lifted up 5312 5683? who 5101 is 2076 5748 this 3778 Son 5207 of man 444? 

12:35 Then 3767 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Yet 2089 a little 3398 while 5550 is 2076 5748 the light 5457 with 3326 you 5216. Walk 4043 5720 while 2193 ye have 2192 5719 the light 5457, lest 3363 darkness 4653 come upon 2638 5632 you 5209: for 2532 he that walketh 4043 5723 in 1722 darkness 4653 knoweth 1492 5758 not 3756 whither 4226 he goeth 5217 5719. 

12:36 While 2193 ye have 2192 5719 light 5457, believe 4100 5720 in 1519 the light 5457, that 2443 ye may be 1096 5638 the children 5207 of light 5457. These things 5023 spake 2980 5656 Jesus 2424, and departed 565 5631, and 2532 did hide himself 2928 5648 from 575 them 846. 

12:37 But 1161 though he 846 had done 4160 5761 so many 5118 miracles 4592 before 1715 them 846, yet they believed 4100 5707 not 3756 on 1519 him 846: 

12:38 That 2443 the saying 3056 of Esaias 2268 the prophet 4396 might be fulfilled 4137 5686, which 3739 he spake 2036 5627, Lord 2962, who 5101 hath believed 4100 5656 our 2257 report 189? and 2532 to whom 5101 hath the arm 1023 of the Lord 2962 been revealed 601 5681? 

12:39 Therefore 5124 1223 they could 1410 5711 not 3756 believe 4100 5721, because 3754 that Esaias 2268 said 2036 5627 again 3825, 

12:40 He hath blinded 5186 5758 their 846 eyes 3788, and 2532 hardened 4456 5758 their 846 heart 2588; that 3363 0 they should 1492 0 not 3363 see 1492 5632 with [their] eyes 3788, nor 2532 understand 3539 5661 with [their] heart 2588, and 2532 be converted 1994 5652, and 2532 I should heal 2390 5667 them 846. 

12:41 These things 5023 said 2036 5627 Esaias 2268, when 3753 he saw 1492 5627 his 846 glory 1391, and 2532 spake 2980 5656 of 4012 him 846. 

12:42 Nevertheless 3676 3305 among 1537 the chief rulers 758 also 2532 many 4183 believed 4100 5656 on 1519 him 846; but 235 because 1223 of the Pharisees 5330 they did 3670 0 not 3756 confess 3670 5707 [him], lest 3363 they should be 1096 5638 put out of the synagogue 656: 

12:43 For 1063 they loved 25 5656 the praise 1391 of men 444 more 3123 than 2260 the praise 1391 of God 2316. 

12:44 1161 Jesus 2424 cried 2896 5656 and 2532 said 2036 5627, He that believeth 4100 5723 on 1519 me 1691, believeth 4100 5719 not 3756 on 1519 me 1691, but 235 on 1519 him that sent 3992 5660 me 3165. 

12:45 And 2532 he that seeth 2334 5723 me 1691 seeth 2334 5719 him that sent 3992 5660 me 3165. 

12:46 I 1473 am come 2064 5754 a light 5457 into 1519 the world 2889, that 3363 0 whosoever 3956 believeth 4100 5723 on 1519 me 1691 should 3306 0 not 3363 abide 3306 5661 in 1722 darkness 4653. 

12:47 And 2532 if 3362 any man 5100 hear 191 5661 my 3450 words 4487, and 2532 believe 4100 5661 not 3361, I 1473 judge 2919 5692 5719 him 846 not 3756: for 1063 I came 2064 5627 not 3756 to 2443 judge 2919 5725 the world 2889, but 235 to 2443 save 4982 5661 the world 2889. 

12:48 He that rejecteth 114 5723 me 1691, and 2532 receiveth 2983 5723 not 3361 my 3450 words 4487, hath 2192 5719 one that judgeth 2919 5723 him 846: the word 3056 that 3739 I have spoken 2980 5656, the same 1565 shall judge 2919 5692 him 846 in 1722 the last 2078 day 2250. 

12:49 For 3754 I 1473 have 2980 0 not 3756 spoken 2980 5656 of 1537 myself 1683; but 235 the Father 3962 which sent 3992 5660 me 3165, he gave 1325 5656 me 3427 a commandment 1785, what 5101 I should say 2036 5632, and 2532 what 5101 I should speak 2980 5661. 

12:50 And 2532 I know 1492 5758 that 3754 his 846 commandment 1785 is 2076 5748 life 2222 everlasting 166: whatsoever 3739 I 1473 speak 2980 5719 therefore 3767, even as 2531 the Father 3962 said 2046 5758 unto me 3427, so 3779 I speak 2980 5719. 

13:1 Now 1161 before 4253 the feast 1859 of the passover 3957, when Jesus 2424 knew 1492 5761 that 3754 his 846 hour 5610 was come 2064 5754 that 2443 he should depart 3327 5632 out of 1537 this 5127 world 2889 unto 4314 the Father 3962, having loved 25 5660 his own 2398 which 3588 were in 1722 the world 2889, he loved 25 5656 them 846 unto 1519 the end 5056. 

13:2 And 2532 supper 1173 being ended 1096 5637, the devil 1228 having now 2235 put 906 5761 into 1519 the heart 2588 of Judas 2455 Iscariot 2469, Simon's 4613 [son], to 2443 betray 3860 5632 him 846; 

13:3 Jesus 2424 knowing 1492 5761 that 3754 the Father 3962 had given 1325 5758 all things 3956 into 1519 his 846 hands 5495, and 2532 that 3754 he was come 1831 5627 from 575 God 2316, and 2532 went 5217 5719 to 4314 God 2316; 

13:4 He riseth 1453 5743 from 1537 supper 1173, and 2532 laid aside 5087 5719 his 846 garments 2440; and 2532 took 2983 5631 a towel 3012, and girded 1241 5656 himself 1438. 

13:5 After that 1534 he poureth 906 5719 water 5204 into 1519 a bason 3537, and 2532 began 756 5662 to wash 3538 5721 the disciples 3101' feet 4228, and 2532 to wipe 1591 5721 [them] with the towel 3012 wherewith 3739 he was 2258 5713 girded 1241 5772. 

13:6 Then 3767 cometh he 2064 5736 to 4314 Simon 4613 Peter 4074: and 2532 Peter 1565 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Lord 2962, dost 3538 0 thou 4771 wash 3538 5719 my 3450 feet 4228? 

13:7 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, What 3739 I 1473 do 4160 5719 thou 4771 knowest 1492 5758 not 3756 now 737; but 1161 thou shalt know 1097 5695 hereafter 3326 5023. 

13:8 Peter 4074 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Thou shalt 3538 0 never 1519 165 3364 wash 3538 5661 my 3450 feet 4228. Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 him 846, If 3362 0 I wash 3538 5661 thee 4571 not 3362, thou hast 2192 5719 no 3756 part 3313 with 3326 me 1700. 

13:9 Simon 4613 Peter 4074 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Lord 2962, not 3361 my 3450 feet 4228 only 3440, but 235 also 2532 [my] hands 5495 and 2532 [my] head 2776. 

13:10 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 to him 846, He that is washed 3068 5772 needeth 5532 not 3756 2192 5719 save 2228 to wash 3538 5670 [his] feet 4228, but 235 is 2076 5748 clean 2513 every whit 3650: and 2532 ye 5210 are 2075 5748 clean 2513, but 235 not 3780 all 3956. 

13:11 For 1063 he knew 1492 5715 who 3588 should betray 3860 5723 him 846; therefore 5124 1223 said he 2036 5627, Ye are 2075 5748 not 3780 all 3956 clean 2513. 

13:12 So 3767 after 3753 he had washed 3538 5656 their 846 feet 4228, and 2532 had taken 2983 5627 his 848 garments 2440, and was set down 377 5631 again 3825, he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Know ye 1097 5719 what 5101 I have done 4160 5758 to you 5213? 

13:13 Ye 5210 call 5455 5719 me 3165 Master 1320 and 2532 Lord 2962: and 2532 ye say 3004 5719 well 2573; for 1063 [so] I am 1510 5748. 

13:14 If 1487 I 1473 then 3767, [your] Lord 2962 and 2532 Master 1320, have washed 3538 5656 your 5216 feet 4228; ye 5210 also 2532 ought 3784 5719 to wash 3538 5721 one another's 240 feet 4228. 

13:15 For 1063 I have given 1325 5656 you 5213 an example 5262, that 2443 ye 5210 should do 4160 5725 as 2531 2532 I 1473 have done 4160 5656 to you 5213. 

13:16 Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, The servant 1401 is 2076 5748 not 3756 greater than 3187 his 848 lord 2962; neither 3761 he that is sent 652 greater than 3187 he that sent 3992 5660 him 846. 

13:17 If 1487 ye know 1492 5758 these things 5023, happy 3107 are ye 2075 5748 if 1437 ye do 4160 5725 them 846. 

13:18 I speak 3004 5719 not 3756 of 4012 you 5216 all 3956: I 1473 know 1492 5758 whom 3739 I have chosen 1586 5668: but 235 that 2443 the scripture 1124 may be fulfilled 4137 5686, He that eateth 5176 5723 bread 740 with 3326 me 1700 hath lifted up 1869 5656 his 848 heel 4418 against 1909 me 1691. 

13:19 Now 575 737 I tell 3004 5719 you 5213 before 4253 it come 1096 5635, that 2443, when 3752 it is come to pass 1096 5638, ye may believe 4100 5661 that 3754 I 1473 am 1510 5748 [he]. 

13:20 Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, He that receiveth 2983 5723 whomsoever 1437 5100 I send 3992 5661 receiveth 2983 5719 me 1691; and 1161 he that receiveth 2983 5723 me 1691 receiveth 2983 5719 him that sent 3992 5660 me 3165. 

13:21 When Jesus 2424 had 2036 0 thus 5023 said 2036 5631, he was troubled 5015 5681 in spirit 4151, and 2532 testified 3140 5656, and 2532 said 2036 5627, Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, that 3754 one 1520 of 1537 you 5216 shall betray 3860 5692 me 3165. 

13:22 Then 3767 the disciples 3101 looked 991 5707 one on another 1519 240, doubting 639 5734 of 4012 whom 5101 he spake 3004 5719. 

13:23 Now 1161 there was 2258 5713 leaning 345 5740 on 1722 Jesus 2424' bosom 2859 one 1520 of his 846 disciples 3101, whom 3739 Jesus 2424 loved 25 5707. 

13:24 Simon 4613 Peter 4074 therefore 3767 beckoned 3506 5719 to him 5129, that he should ask 4441 5635 who 5101 it should 302 be 1498 5751 of 4012 whom 3739 he spake 3004 5719. 

13:25 He 1565 then 1161 lying on 1968 5631 1909 Jesus 2424' breast 4738 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Lord 2962, who 5101 is it 2076 5748? 

13:26 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5736, He 1565 it is 2076 5748, to whom 3739 I shall give 1929 5692 a sop 5596, when I 1473 have dipped 911 5660 [it]. And 2532 when he had dipped 1686 5660 the sop 5596, he gave 1325 5719 [it] to Judas 2455 Iscariot 2469, [the son] of Simon 4613. 

13:27 And 2532 after 3326 the sop 5596 5119 Satan 4567 entered 1525 5627 into 1519 him 1565. Then 3767 said 3004 5719 Jesus 2424 unto him 846, That thou doest 4160 5719, do 4160 5657 quickly 5032. 

13:28 Now 1161 no man 3762 at the table 345 5740 knew 1097 5627 for what 4314 intent 5101 he spake 2036 5627 this 5124 unto him 846. 

13:29 For 1063 some 5100 [of them] thought 1380 5707, because 1893 Judas 2455 had 2192 5707 the bag 1101, that 3754 Jesus 2424 had said 3004 5719 unto him 846, Buy 59 5657 [those things] that 3739 we have 2192 5719 need of 5532 against 1519 the feast 1859; or 2228, that 2443 he should give 1325 5632 something 5100 to the poor 4434. 

13:30 He 1565 then 3767 having received 2983 5631 the sop 5596 went 1831 0 immediately 2112 out 1831 5627: and 1161 it was 2258 5713 night 3571. 

13:31 Therefore 3767, when 3753 he was gone out 1831 5627, Jesus 2424 said 3004 5719, Now 3568 is 1392 0 the Son 5207 of man 444 glorified 1392 5681, and 2532 God 2316 is glorified 1392 5681 in 1722 him 846. 

13:32 If 1487 God 2316 be glorified 1392 5681 in 1722 him 846, God 2316 shall 1392 0 also 2532 glorify 1392 5692 him 846 in 1722 himself 1438, and 2532 shall 1392 0 straightway 2117 glorify 1392 5692 him 846. 

13:33 Little children 5040, yet 2089 a little while 3397 I am 1510 5748 with 3326 you 5216. Ye shall seek 2212 5692 me 3165: and 2532 as 2531 I said 2036 5627 unto the Jews 2453, 3754 Whither 3699 I 1473 go 5217 5719, ye 5210 cannot 3756 1410 5736 come 2064 5629; so 2532 now 737 I say 3004 5719 to you 5213. 

13:34 A new 2537 commandment 1785 I give 1325 5719 unto you 5213, That 2443 ye love 25 5725 one another 240; as 2531 I have loved 25 5656 you 5209, that 2443 ye 5210 also 2532 love 25 5725 one another 240. 

13:35 By 1722 this 5129 shall 1097 0 all 3956 [men] know 1097 5695 that 3754 ye are 2075 5748 my 1699 disciples 3101, if 1437 ye have 2192 5725 love 26 one to another 1722 240. 

13:36 Simon 4613 Peter 4074 said 3004 5719 unto him 846, Lord 2962, whither 4226 goest 5217 5719 thou? Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 him 846, Whither 3699 I go 5217 5719, thou canst 1410 5736 not 3756 follow 190 5658 me 3427 now 3568; but 1161 thou shalt follow 190 5692 me 3427 afterwards 5305. 

13:37 Peter 4074 said 3004 5719 unto him 846, Lord 2962, why 1302 cannot 3756 1410 5736 I follow 190 5658 thee 4671 now 737? I will lay down 5087 5692 my 3450 life 5590 for 5228 thy sake 4675. 

13:38 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 him 846, Wilt thou lay down 5087 5692 thy 4675 life 5590 for 5228 my sake 1700? Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto thee 4671, The cock 220 shall 5455 0 not 3364 crow 5455 5692, till 2193 3739 thou hast denied 533 5695 me 3165 thrice 5151. 

14:1 Let 5015 0 not 3361 your 5216 heart 2588 be troubled 5015 5744: ye believe 4100 5720 in 1519 God 2316, believe 4100 5719 5720 also 2532 in 1519 me 1691. 

14:2 In 1722 my 3450 Father's 3962 house 3614 are 1526 5748 many 4183 mansions 3438: if [it were] not 1490 [so], I would have told 302 2036 5627 you 5213. I go 4198 5736 to prepare 2090 5658 a place 5117 for you 5213. 

14:3 And 2532 if 1437 I go 4198 5680 and 2532 prepare 2090 5661 a place 5117 for you 5213, I will come 2064 5736 again 3825, and 2532 receive 3880 5695 you 5209 unto 4314 myself 1683; that 2443 where 3699 I 1473 am 1510 5748, [there] ye 5210 may be 5600 5753 also 2532. 

14:4 And 2532 whither 3699 I 1473 go 5217 5719 ye know 1492 5758, and 2532 the way 3598 ye know 1492 5758. 

14:5 Thomas 2381 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Lord 2962, we know 1492 5758 not 3756 whither 4226 thou goest 5217 5719; and 2532 how 4459 can we 1410 5736 know 1492 5760 the way 3598? 

14:6 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, I 1473 am 1510 5748 the way 3598, 2532 the truth 225, and 2532 the life 2222: no man 3762 cometh 2064 5736 unto 4314 the Father 3962, but 1508 by 1223 me 1700. 

14:7 If 1487 ye had known 1097 5715 me 3165, 302 ye should have known 1097 5715 my 3450 Father 3962 also 2532: and 2532 from 575 henceforth 737 ye know 1097 5719 him 846, and 2532 have seen 3708 5758 him 846. 

14:8 Philip 5376 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Lord 2962, shew 1166 5657 us 2254 the Father 3962, and 2532 it sufficeth 714 5719 us 2254. 

14:9 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Have I been 1510 5748 so long 5118 time 5550 with 3326 you 5216, and yet 2532 hast thou 1097 0 not 3756 known 1097 5758 me 3165, Philip 5376? he that hath seen 3708 5761 me 1691 hath seen 3708 5758 the Father 3962; and 2532 how 4459 sayest 3004 5719 thou 4771 [then], Shew 1166 5657 us 2254 the Father 3962? 

14:10 Believest thou 4100 5719 not 3756 that 3754 I 1473 am 2076 5748 in 1722 the Father 3962, and 2532 the Father 3962 in 1722 me 1698? the words 4487 that 3739 I 1473 speak 2980 5719 unto you 5213 I speak 2980 5719 not 3756 of 575 myself 1683: but 1161 the Father 3962 that dwelleth 3306 5723 in 1722 me 1698, he 846 doeth 4160 5719 the works 2041. 

14:11 Believe 4100 5720 me 3427 that 3754 I 1473 [am] in 1722 the Father 3962, and 2532 the Father 3962 in 1722 me 1698: or else 1490 believe 4100 5720 me 3427 for 1223 the very 846 0 works 2041' sake 846. 

14:12 Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, He that believeth 4100 5723 on 1519 me 1691, the works 2041 that I 1473 do 4160 5719 shall he do 4160 5692 also 2548; and 2532 greater [works] than 3187 these 5130 shall he do 4160 5692; because 3754 I 1473 go 4198 5736 unto 4314 my 3450 Father 3962. 

14:13 And 2532 whatsoever 3748 302 ye shall ask 154 5661 in 1722 my 3450 name 3686, that 5124 will I do 4160 5692, that 2443 the Father 3962 may be glorified 1392 5686 in 1722 the Son 5207. 

14:14 If 1437 ye shall ask 154 5661 any thing 5100 in 1722 my 3450 name 3686, I 1473 will do 4160 5692 [it]. 

14:15 If 1437 ye love 25 5725 me 3165, keep 5083 5657 my 1699 commandments 1785. 

14:16 And 2532 I 1473 will pray 2065 5692 the Father 3962, and 2532 he shall give 1325 5692 you 5213 another 243 Comforter 3875, that 2443 he may abide 3306 5725 with 3326 you 5216 for 1519 ever 165; 

14:17 [Even] the Spirit 4151 of truth 225; whom 3739 the world 2889 cannot 3756 1410 5736 receive 2983 5629, because 3754 it seeth 2334 5719 him 846 not 3756, neither 3761 knoweth 1097 5719 him 846: but 1161 ye 5210 know 1097 5719 him 846; for 3754 he dwelleth 3306 5719 with 3844 you 5213, and 2532 shall be 2071 5704 in 1722 you 5213. 

14:18 I will 863 0 not 3756 leave 863 5692 you 5209 comfortless 3737: I will come 2064 5736 to 4314 you 5209. 

14:19 Yet 2089 a little while 3397, and 2532 the world 2889 seeth 2334 5719 me 3165 no 3765 more 2089; but 1161 ye 5210 see 2334 5719 me 3165: because 3754 I 1473 live 2198 5719, ye 5210 shall live 2198 5695 also 2532. 

14:20 At 1722 that 1565 day 2250 ye 5210 shall know 1097 5695 that 3754 I 1473 [am] in 1722 my 3450 Father 3962, and 2532 ye 5210 in 1722 me 1698, and I 2504 in 1722 you 5213. 

14:21 He that hath 2192 5723 my 3450 commandments 1785, and 2532 keepeth 5083 5723 them 846, he 1565 it is 2076 5748 that loveth 25 5723 me 3165: and 1161 he that loveth 25 5723 me 3165 shall be loved 25 5701 of 5259 my 3450 Father 3962, and 2532 I 1473 will love 25 5692 him 846, and 2532 will manifest 1718 5692 myself 1683 to him 846. 

14:22 Judas 2455 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, not 3756 Iscariot 2469, Lord 2962, how 5101 is it 1096 5754 that 3754 thou wilt 3195 5719 manifest 1718 5721 thyself 4572 unto us 2254, and 2532 not 3780 unto the world 2889? 

14:23 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, If 1437 a man 5100 love 25 5725 me 3165, he will keep 5083 5692 my 3450 words 3056: and 2532 my 3450 Father 3962 will love 25 5692 him 846, and 2532 we will come 2064 5695 unto 4314 him 846, and 2532 make 4160 5692 our abode 3438 with 3844 him 846. 

14:24 He that loveth 25 5723 me 3165 not 3361 keepeth 5083 5719 not 3756 my 3450 sayings 3056: and 2532 the word 3056 which 3739 ye hear 191 5719 is 2076 5748 not 3756 mine 1699, but 235 the Father's 3962 which 3588 sent 3992 5660 me 3165. 

14:25 These things 5023 have I spoken 2980 5758 unto you 5213, being [yet] present 3306 5723 with 3844 you 5213. 

14:26 But 1161 the Comforter 3875, [which is] the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, whom 3739 the Father 3962 will send 3992 5692 in 1722 my 3450 name 3686, he 1565 shall teach 1321 5692 you 5209 all things 3956, and 2532 bring 5279 0 all things 3956 to 5279 0 your 5209 remembrance 5279 5692, whatsoever 3739 I have said 2036 5627 unto you 5213. 

14:27 Peace 1515 I leave 863 5719 with you 5213, my 1699 peace 1515 I give 1325 5719 unto you 5213: not 3756 as 2531 the world 2889 giveth 1325 5719, give 1325 5719 I 1473 unto you 5213. Let 5015 0 not 3361 your 5216 heart 2588 be troubled 5015 5744, neither 3366 let it be afraid 1168 5720. 

14:28 Ye have heard 191 5656 how 3754 I 1473 said 2036 5627 unto you 5213, I go away 5217 5719, and 2532 come 2064 5736 [again] unto 4314 you 5209. If 1487 ye loved 25 5707 me 3165, 302 ye would rejoice 5463 5644, because 3754 I said 2036 5627, I go 4198 5736 unto 4314 the Father 3962: for 3754 my 3450 Father 3962 is 2076 5748 greater than 3187 I 3450. 

14:29 And 2532 now 3568 I have told 2046 5758 you 5213 before 4250 it come to pass 1096 5635, that 2443, when 3752 it is come to pass 1096 5638, ye might believe 4100 5661. 

14:30 Hereafter 2089 3765 0 I will 2980 0 not 3765 talk 2980 5692 much 4183 with 3326 you 5216: for 1063 the prince 758 of this 5127 world 2889 cometh 2064 5736, and 2532 hath 2192 5719 3756 nothing 3762 in 1722 me 1698. 

14:31 But 235 that 2443 the world 2889 may know 1097 5632 that 3754 I love 25 5719 the Father 3962; and 2532 as 2531 the Father 3962 gave 1781 0 me 3427 commandment 1781 5662, even so 3779 I do 4160 5719. Arise 1453 5728, let us go 71 5725 hence 1782. 

15:1 I 1473 am 1510 5748 the true 228 vine 288, and 2532 my 3450 Father 3962 is 2076 5748 the husbandman 1092. 

15:2 Every 3956 branch 2814 in 1722 me 1698 that 846 beareth 5342 5723 not 3361 fruit 2590 he taketh away 142 5719: and 2532 every 3956 [branch] that beareth 5342 5723 fruit 2590, he purgeth 2508 5719 it 846, that 2443 it may bring forth 5342 5725 more 4119 fruit 2590. 

15:3 Now 2235 ye 5210 are 2075 5748 clean 2513 through 1223 the word 3056 which 3739 I have spoken 2980 5758 unto you 5213. 

15:4 Abide 3306 5657 in 1722 me 1698, and I 2504 in 1722 you 5213. As 2531 the branch 2814 cannot 3756 1410 5736 bear 5342 5721 fruit 2590 of 575 itself 1438, except 3362 it abide 3306 5661 in 1722 the vine 288; no more 3761 3779 can ye 5210, except 3362 ye abide 3306 5661 in 1722 me 1698. 

15:5 I 1473 am 1510 5748 the vine 288, ye 5210 [are] the branches 2814: He that abideth 3306 5723 in 1722 me 1698, and I 2504 in 1722 him 846, the same 3778 bringeth forth 5342 5719 much 4183 fruit 2590: for 3754 without 5565 me 1700 ye can 1410 5736 do 4160 5721 nothing 3756 3762. 

15:6 If 3362 0 a man 5100 abide 3306 5661 not 3362 in 1722 me 1698, he is cast 906 5681 forth 1854 as 5613 a branch 2814, and 2532 is withered 3583 5681; and 2532 men gather 4863 5719 them 846, and 2532 cast 906 5719 [them] into 1519 the fire 4442, and 2532 they are burned 2545 5743. 

15:7 If 1437 ye abide 3306 5661 in 1722 me 1698, and 2532 my 3450 words 4487 abide 3306 5661 in 1722 you 5213, ye shall ask 154 5698 what 3739 1437 ye will 2309 5725, and 2532 it shall be done 1096 5695 unto you 5213. 

15:8 Herein 1722 5129 is 1392 0 my 3450 Father 3962 glorified 1392 5681, that 2443 ye bear 5342 5725 much 4183 fruit 2590; so 2532 shall ye be 1096 5695 my 1699 disciples 3101. 

15:9 As 2531 the Father 3962 hath loved 25 5656 me 3165, so 2504 0 have 25 0 I 2504 loved 25 5656 you 5209: continue ye 3306 5657 in 1722 my 1699 love 26. 

15:10 If 1437 ye keep 5083 5661 my 3450 commandments 1785, ye shall abide 3306 5692 in 1722 my 3450 love 26; even as 2531 I 1473 have kept 5083 5758 my 3450 Father's 3962 commandments 1785, and 2532 abide 3306 5719 in 1722 his 846 love 26. 

15:11 These things 5023 have I spoken 2980 5758 unto you 5213, that 2443 my 1699 joy 5479 might remain 3306 5661 in 1722 you 5213, and 2532 [that] your 5216 joy 5479 might be full 4137 5686. 

15:12 This 3778 is 2076 5748 my 1699 commandment 1785, That 2443 ye love 25 5725 one another 240, as 2531 I have loved 25 5656 you 5209. 

15:13 Greater 3187 0 love 26 hath 2192 5719 no man 3762 than 3187 this 5026, that 2443 a man 5100 lay down 5087 5632 his 848 life 5590 for 5228 his 848 friends 5384. 

15:14 Ye 5210 are 2075 5748 my 3450 friends 5384, if 1437 ye do 4160 5725 whatsoever 3745 I 1473 command 1781 5736 you 5213. 

15:15 Henceforth 3765 0 I call 3004 5719 you 5209 not 3765 servants 1401; for 3754 the servant 1401 knoweth 1492 5758 not 3756 what 5101 his 846 lord 2962 doeth 4160 5719: but 1161 I have called 2046 5758 you 5209 friends 5384; for 3754 all things 3956 that 3739 I have heard 191 5656 of 3844 my 3450 Father 3962 I have made known 1107 5656 unto you 5213. 

15:16 Ye 5210 have 1586 0 not 3756 chosen 1586 5668 me 3165, but 235 I 1473 have chosen 1586 5668 you 5209, and 2532 ordained 5087 5656 you 5209, that 2443 ye 5210 should go 5217 5725 and 2532 bring forth 5342 5725 fruit 2590, and 2532 [that] your 5216 fruit 2590 should remain 3306 5725: that 2443 whatsoever 302 3748 ye shall ask 154 5661 of the Father 3962 in 1722 my 3450 name 3686, he may give it 1325 5632 you 5213. 

15:17 These things 5023 I command 1781 5736 you 5213, that 2443 ye love 25 5725 one another 240. 

15:18 If 1487 the world 2889 hate 3404 5719 you 5209, ye know 1097 5719 5720 that 3754 it hated 3404 5758 me 1691 before 4412 [it hated] you 5216. 

15:19 If 1487 ye were 2258 5713 of 1537 the world 2889, the world 2889 would 302 love 5368 5707 his own 2398: but 1161 because 3754 ye are 2075 5748 not 3756 of 1537 the world 2889, but 235 I 1473 have chosen 1586 5668 you 5209 out of 1537 the world 2889, therefore 5124 1223 the world 2889 hateth 3404 5719 you 5209. 

15:20 Remember 3421 5720 the word 3056 that 3739 I 1473 said 2036 5627 unto you 5213, The servant 1401 is 2076 5748 not 3756 greater than 3187 his 848 lord 2962. If 1487 they have persecuted 1377 5656 me 1691, they will 1377 0 also 2532 persecute 1377 5692 you 5209; if 1487 they have kept 5083 5656 my 3450 saying 3056, they will keep 5083 5692 yours 5212 also 2532. 

15:21 But 235 all 3956 these things 5023 will they do 4160 5692 unto you 5213 for 1223 my 3450 0 name's 3686 sake 3450, because 3754 they know 1492 5758 not 3756 him that sent 3992 5660 me 3165. 

15:22 If 1508 0 I had 2064 0 not 1508 come 2064 5627 and 2532 spoken 2980 5656 unto them 846, they had 2192 0 not 3756 had 2192 5707 sin 266: but 1161 now 3568 they have 2192 5719 no 3756 cloke 4392 for 4012 their 848 sin 266. 

15:23 He that hateth 3404 5723 me 1691 hateth 3404 5719 my 3450 Father 3962 also 2532. 

15:24 If 1508 0 I had 4160 0 not 1508 done 4160 5656 among 1722 them 846 the works 2041 which 3739 none 3762 other man 243 did 4160 5758, they had 2192 0 not 3756 had 2192 5707 sin 266: but 1161 now 3568 have they 3708 0 both 2532 seen 3708 5758 and 2532 hated 3404 5758 both 2532 me 1691 and 2532 my 3450 Father 3962. 

15:25 But 235 [this cometh to pass], that 2443 the word 3056 might be fulfilled 4137 5686 that is written 1125 5772 in 1722 their 846 law 3551, 3754 They hated 3404 5656 me 3165 without a cause 1432. 

15:26 But 1161 when 3752 the Comforter 3875 is come 2064 5632, whom 3739 I 1473 will send 3992 5692 unto you 5213 from 3844 the Father 3962, [even] the Spirit 4151 of truth 225, which 3739 proceedeth 1607 5736 from 3844 the Father 3962, he 1565 shall testify 3140 5692 of 4012 me 1700: 

15:27 And 1161 ye 5210 also 2532 shall bear witness 3140 5719, because 3754 ye have been 2075 5748 with 3326 me 1700 from 575 the beginning 746. 

16:1 These things 5023 have I spoken 2980 5758 unto you 5213, that 3363 0 ye should 4624 0 not 3363 be offended 4624 5686. 

16:2 They shall put 4160 5692 you 5209 out of the synagogues 656: yea 235, the time 5610 cometh 2064 5736, that 2443 whosoever 3956 killeth 615 5660 you 5209 will think 1380 5661 that he doeth 4374 5721 God 2316 service 2999. 

16:3 And 2532 these things 5023 will they do 4160 5692 unto you 5213, because 3754 they have 1097 0 not 3756 known 1097 5627 the Father 3962, nor 3761 me 1691. 

16:4 But 235 these things 5023 have I told 2980 5758 you 5213, that 2443 when 3752 the time 5610 shall come 2064 5632, ye may remember 3421 5725 that 3754 I 1473 told 2036 5627 you 5213 of them 846. And 1161 these things 5023 I said 2036 5627 not 3756 unto you 5213 at 1537 the beginning 746, because 3754 I was 2252 5713 with 3326 you 5216. 

16:5 But 1161 now 3568 I go my way 5217 5719 to 4314 him that sent 3992 5660 me 3165; and 2532 none 3762 of 1537 you 5216 asketh 2065 5719 me 3165, Whither 4226 goest thou 5217 5719? 

16:6 But 235 because 3754 I have said 2980 5758 these things 5023 unto you 5213, sorrow 3077 hath filled 4137 5758 your 5216 heart 2588. 

16:7 Nevertheless 235 I 1473 tell 3004 5719 you 5213 the truth 225; It is expedient 4851 5719 for you 5213 that 2443 I 1473 go away 565 5632: for 1063 if 3362 0 I go 565 0 not 3362 away 565 5632, the Comforter 3875 will 2064 0 not 3756 come 2064 5695 unto 4314 you 5209; but 1161 if 1437 I depart 4198 5680, I will send 3992 5692 him 846 unto 4314 you 5209. 

16:8 And 2532 when he is come 2064 5631, he 1565 will reprove 1651 5692 the world 2889 of 4012 sin 266, and 2532 of 4012 righteousness 1343, and 2532 of 4012 judgment 2920: 

16:9 Of 4012 sin 266, 3303 because 3754 they believe 4100 5719 not 3756 on 1519 me 1691; 

16:10 Of 4012 1161 righteousness 1343, because 3754 I go 5217 5719 to 4314 my 3450 Father 3962, and 2532 ye see 2334 5719 me 3165 no 3765 more 2089; 

16:11 Of 4012 1161 judgment 2920, because 3754 the prince 758 of this 5127 world 2889 is judged 2919 5769. 

16:12 I have 2192 5719 yet 2089 many things 4183 to say 3004 5721 unto you 5213, but 235 ye cannot 3756 1410 5736 bear them 941 5721 now 737. 

16:13 Howbeit 1161 when 3752 he 1565, the Spirit 4151 of truth 225, is come 2064 5632, he will guide 3594 5692 you 5209 into 1519 all 3956 truth 225: for 1063 he shall 2980 0 not 3756 speak 2980 5692 of 575 himself 1438; but 235 whatsoever 3745 302 he shall hear 191 5661, [that] shall he speak 2980 5692: and 2532 he will shew 312 5692 you 5213 things to come 2064 5740. 

16:14 He 1565 shall glorify 1392 5692 me 1691: for 3754 he shall receive 2983 5695 of 1537 mine 1699, and 2532 shall shew 312 5692 [it] unto you 5213. 

16:15 All things 3956 that 3745 the Father 3962 hath 2192 5719 are 2076 5748 mine 1699: therefore 5124 1223 said I 2036 5627, that 3754 he shall take 2983 5695 of 1537 mine 1699, and 2532 shall shew 312 5692 [it] unto you 5213. 

16:16 A little while 3397, and 2532 ye shall 2334 0 not 3756 see 2334 5719 me 3165: and 2532 again 3825, a little while 3397, and 2532 ye shall see 3700 5695 me 3165, because 3754 I 1473 go 5217 5719 to 4314 the Father 3962. 

16:17 Then 3767 said 2036 5627 [some] of 1537 his 846 disciples 3101 among 4314 themselves 240, What 5101 is 2076 5748 this 5124 that he saith 3004 5719 unto us 2254, A little while 3397, and 2532 ye shall 2334 0 not 3756 see 2334 5719 me 3165: and 2532 again 3825, a little while 3397, and 2532 ye shall see 3700 5695 me 3165: and 2532, Because 3754 I 1473 go 5217 5719 to 4314 the Father 3962? 

16:18 They said 3004 5707 therefore 3767, What 5101 is 2076 5748 this 5124 that he saith 3004 5719, A little while 3397? we cannot 3756 1492 0 tell 1492 5758 what 5101 he saith 2980 5719. 

16:19 Now 3767 Jesus 2424 knew 1097 5627 that 3754 they were desirous 2309 5707 to ask 2065 5721 him 846, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Do ye enquire 2212 5719 among 3326 yourselves 240 of 4012 that 5127 3754 I said 2036 5627, A little while 3397, and 2532 ye shall 2334 0 not 3756 see 2334 5719 me 3165: and 2532 again 3825, a little while 3397, and 2532 ye shall see 3700 5695 me 3165? 

16:20 Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 ye 5210 shall weep 2799 5692 and 2532 lament 2354 5692, but 1161 the world 2889 shall rejoice 5463 5690: and 1161 ye 5210 shall be sorrowful 3076 5701, but 235 your 5216 sorrow 3077 shall be turned 1096 5695 into 1519 joy 5479. 

16:21 A woman 1135 when 3752 she is in travail 5088 5725 hath 2192 5719 sorrow 3077, because 3754 her 846 hour 5610 is come 2064 5627: but 1161 as soon as 3752 she is delivered 1080 5661 of the child 3813, she remembereth 3421 5719 no 3765 more 2089 the anguish 2347, for 1223 joy 5479 that 3754 a man 444 is born 1080 5681 into 1519 the world 2889. 

16:22 And 2532 ye 5210 3303 now 3568 therefore 3767 have 2192 5719 sorrow 3077: but 1161 I will see 3700 5695 you 5209 again 3825, and 2532 your 5216 heart 2588 shall rejoice 5463 5690, and 2532 your 5216 joy 5479 no man 3762 taketh 142 5719 from 575 you 5216. 

16:23 And 2532 in 1722 that 1565 day 2250 ye shall 3756 ask 2065 5692 me 1691 nothing 3762. Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, 3754 Whatsoever 3745 302 ye shall ask 154 5661 the Father 3962 in 1722 my 3450 name 3686, he will give 1325 5692 [it] you 5213. 

16:24 Hitherto 2193 737 have ye asked 154 5656 nothing 3756 3762 in 1722 my 3450 name 3686: ask 154 5720, and 2532 ye shall receive 2983 5695, that 2443 your 5216 joy 5479 may be 5600 5753 full 4137 5772. 

16:25 These things 5023 have I spoken 2980 5758 unto you 5213 in 1722 proverbs 3942: but 235 the time 5610 cometh 2064 5736, when 3753 I shall 2980 0 no more 2089 3765 speak 2980 5692 unto you 5213 in 1722 proverbs 3942, but 235 I shall shew 312 5692 you 5213 plainly 3954 of 4012 the Father 3962. 

16:26 At 1722 that 1565 day 2250 ye shall ask 154 5698 in 1722 my 3450 name 3686: and 2532 I say 3004 5719 not 3756 unto you 5213, that 3754 I 1473 will pray 2065 5692 the Father 3962 for 4012 you 5216: 

16:27 For 1063 the Father 3962 himself 846 loveth 5368 5719 you 5209, because 3754 ye 5210 have loved 5368 5758 me 1691, and 2532 have believed 4100 5758 that 3754 I 1473 came out 1831 5627 from 3844 God 2316. 

16:28 I came forth 1831 5627 from 3844 the Father 3962, and 2532 am come 2064 5754 into 1519 the world 2889: again 3825, I leave 863 5719 the world 2889, and 2532 go 4198 5736 to 4314 the Father 3962. 

16:29 His 846 disciples 3101 said 3004 5719 unto him 846, Lo 2396, now 3568 speakest thou 2980 5719 plainly 3954, and 2532 speakest 3004 5719 no 3762 proverb 3942. 

16:30 Now 3568 are we sure 1492 5758 that 3754 thou knowest 1492 5758 all things 3956, and 2532 needest 5532 not 3756 2192 5719 that 2443 any man 5100 should ask 2065 5725 thee 4571: by 1722 this 5129 we believe 4100 5719 that 3754 thou camest forth 1831 5627 from 575 God 2316. 

16:31 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 them 846, Do ye 4100 0 now 737 believe 4100 5719? 

16:32 Behold 2400 5628, the hour 5610 cometh 2064 5736, yea 2532, is 2064 0 now 3568 come 2064 5754, that 2443 ye shall be scattered 4650 5686, every man 1538 to 1519 his own 2398, and 2532 shall leave 863 5632 me 1691 alone 3441: and yet 2532 I am 1510 5748 not 3756 alone 3441, because 3754 the Father 3962 is 2076 5748 with 3326 me 1700. 

16:33 These things 5023 I have spoken 2980 5758 unto you 5213, that 2443 in 1722 me 1698 ye might have 2192 5725 peace 1515. In 1722 the world 2889 ye shall have 2192 5719 5625 2192 5692 tribulation 2347: but 235 be of good cheer 2293 5720; I 1473 have overcome 3528 5758 the world 2889. 

17:1 These words 5023 spake 2980 5656 Jesus 2424, and 2532 lifted up 1869 5656 his 848 eyes 3788 to 1519 heaven 3772, and 2532 said 2036 5627, Father 3962, the hour 5610 is come 2064 5754; glorify 1392 5657 thy 4675 Son 5207, that 2443 thy 4675 Son 5207 also 2532 may glorify 1392 5661 thee 4571: 

17:2 As 2531 thou hast given 1325 5656 him 846 power 1849 over all 3956 flesh 4561, that 2443 he should give 1325 5661 eternal 166 life 2222 to 3739 as many as 3956 thou hast given 1325 5758 him 846. 

17:3 And 1161 this 3778 is 2076 5748 life 2222 eternal 166, that 2443 they might know 1097 5725 thee 4571 the only 3441 true 228 God 2316, and 2532 Jesus 2424 Christ 5547, whom 3739 thou hast sent 649 5656. 

17:4 I 1473 have glorified 1392 5656 thee 4571 on 1909 the earth 1093: I have finished 5048 5656 the work 2041 which 3739 3739 thou gavest 1325 5758 me 3427 to 2443 do 4160 5661. 

17:5 And 2532 now 3568, O Father 3962, glorify 1392 5657 thou 4771 me 3165 with 3844 thine own self 4572 with the glory 1391 which 3739 I had 2192 5707 with 3844 thee 4671 before 4253 the world 2889 was 1511 5750. 

17:6 I have manifested 5319 5656 thy 4675 name 3686 unto the men 444 which 3739 thou gavest 1325 5758 me 3427 out of 1537 the world 2889: thine 4674 they were 2258 5713, and 2532 thou gavest 1325 5758 them 846 me 1698; and 2532 they have kept 5083 5758 thy 4675 word 3056. 

17:7 Now 3568 they have known 1097 5758 that 3754 all things 3956 whatsoever 3745 thou hast given 1325 5758 me 3427 are 2076 5748 of 3844 thee 4675. 

17:8 For 3754 I have given 1325 5758 unto them 846 the words 4487 which 3739 thou gavest 1325 5758 me 3427; and 2532 they have received 2983 5627 [them], and 2532 have known 1097 5627 surely 230 that 3754 I came out 1831 5627 from 3844 thee 4675, and 2532 they have believed 4100 5656 that 3754 thou 4771 didst send 649 5656 me 3165. 

17:9 I 1473 pray 2065 5719 for 4012 them 846: I pray 2065 5719 not 3756 for 4012 the world 2889, but 235 for 4012 them which 3739 thou hast given 1325 5758 me 3427; for 3754 they are 1526 5748 thine 4674. 

17:10 And 2532 all 3956 mine 1699 are 2076 5748 thine 4674, and 2532 thine 4674 are mine 1699; and 2532 I am glorified 1392 5769 in 1722 them 846. 

17:11 And 2532 now 3765 0 I am 1510 5748 no more 2089 3765 in 1722 the world 2889, but 2532 these 3778 are 1526 5748 in 1722 the world 2889, and 2532 I 1473 come 2064 5736 to 4314 thee 4571. Holy 40 Father 3962, keep 5083 5657 through 1722 thine own 4675 name 3686 those 846 whom 3739 thou hast given 1325 5758 me 3427, that 2443 they may be 5600 5753 one 1520, as 2531 we 2249 [are]. 

17:12 While 3753 I was 2252 5713 with 3326 them 846 in 1722 the world 2889, I 1473 kept 5083 5707 them 846 in 1722 thy 4675 name 3686: those 846 that thou gavest 1325 5758 me 3427 I have kept 5442 5656, and 2532 none 3762 of 1537 them 846 is lost 622 5639, but 1508 the son 5207 of perdition 684; that 2443 the scripture 1124 might be fulfilled 4137 5686. 

17:13 And 1161 now 3568 come I 2064 5736 to 4314 thee 4571; and 2532 these things 5023 I speak 2980 5719 in 1722 the world 2889, that 2443 they might have 2192 5725 my 1699 joy 5479 fulfilled 4137 5772 in 1722 themselves 848. 

17:14 I 1473 have given 1325 5758 them 846 thy 4675 word 3056; and 2532 the world 2889 hath hated 3404 5656 them 846, because 3754 they are 1526 5748 not 3756 of 1537 the world 2889, even as 2531 I 1473 am 1510 5748 not 3756 of 1537 the world 2889. 

17:15 I pray 2065 5719 not 3756 that 2443 thou shouldest take 142 5661 them 846 out of 1537 the world 2889, but 235 that 2443 thou shouldest keep 5083 5661 them 846 from 1537 the evil 4190. 

17:16 They are 1526 5748 not 3756 of 1537 the world 2889, even as 2531 I 1473 am 1510 5748 not 3756 of 1537 the world 2889. 

17:17 Sanctify 37 5657 them 846 through 1722 thy 4675 truth 225: thy 4674 word 3056 is 2076 5748 truth 225. 

17:18 As 2531 thou hast sent 649 5656 me 1691 into 1519 the world 2889, even so 2504 0 have 649 0 I also 2504 sent 649 5656 them 846 into 1519 the world 2889. 

17:19 And 2532 for 5228 0 their 846 sakes 52 8 I 1473 sanctify 37 5719 myself 1683, that 2443 they 846 also 2532 might 5600 5753 be sanctified 37 5772 through 1722 the truth 225. 

17:20 Neither 1161 3756 pray I 2065 5719 for 4012 these 5130 alone 3440, but 235 for 4012 them also 2532 which shall believe 4100 5694 on 1519 me 1691 through 1223 their 846 word 3056; 

17:21 That 2443 they all 3956 may be 5600 5753 one 1520; as 2531 thou 4771, Father 3962, [art] in 1722 me 1698, and I 2504 in 1722 thee 4671, that 2443 they 846 also 2532 may be 5600 5753 one 1520 in 1722 us 2254: that 2443 the world 2889 may believe 4100 5661 that 3754 thou 4771 hast sent 649 5656 me 3165. 

17:22 And 2532 the glory 1391 which 3739 thou gavest 1325 5758 me 3427 I 1473 have given 1325 5758 them 846; that 2443 they may be 5600 5753 one 1520, even as 2531 we 2249 are 2070 5748 one 1520: 

17:23 I 1473 in 1722 them 846, and 2532 thou 4771 in 1722 me 1698, that 2443 they may be 5600 5753 made perfect 5048 5772 in 1519 one 1520; and 2532 that 2443 the world 2889 may know 1097 5725 that 3754 thou 4771 hast sent 649 5656 me 3165, and 2532 hast loved 25 5656 them 846, as 2531 thou hast loved 25 5656 me 1691. 

17:24 Father 3962, I will 2309 5719 that 2443 they also 2548, whom 3739 thou hast given 1325 5758 me 3427, be 5600 5753 with 3326 me 1700 where 3699 I 1473 am 1510 5748; that 2443 they may behold 2334 5725 my 1699 glory 1391, which 3739 thou hast given 1325 5656 me 3427: for 3754 thou lovedst 25 5656 me 3165 before 4253 the foundation 2602 of the world 2889. 

17:25 2532 O righteous 1342 Father 3962, the world 2889 hath 1097 0 not 3756 known 1097 5627 thee 4571: but 1161 I 1473 have known 1097 5627 thee 4571, and 2532 these 3778 have known 1097 5627 that 3754 thou 4771 hast sent 649 5656 me 3165. 

17:26 And 2532 I have declared 1107 5656 unto them 846 thy 4675 name 3686, and 2532 will declare 1107 5692 [it]: that 2443 the love 26 wherewith 3739 thou hast loved 25 5656 me 3165 may be 5600 5753 in 1722 them 846, and I 2504 in 1722 them 846. 

18:1 When Jesus 2424 had spoken 2036 5631 these words 5023, he went forth 1831 5627 with 4862 his 848 disciples 3101 over 4008 the brook 5493 Cedron 2748, where 3699 was 2258 5713 a garden 2779, into 1519 the which 3739 he 846 entered 1525 5627, and 2532 his 846 disciples 3101. 

18:2 And 1161 Judas 2455 also 2532, which 3588 betrayed 3860 5723 him 846, knew 1492 5715 the place 5117: for 3754 Jesus 2424 ofttimes 4178 resorted 4863 5681 thither 1563 with 3326 his 848 disciples 3101. 

18:3 Judas 2455 then 3767, having received 2983 5631 a band 4686 [of men] and 2532 officers 5257 from 1537 the chief priests 749 and 2532 Pharisees 5330, cometh 2064 5736 thither 1563 with 3326 lanterns 5322 and 2532 torches 2985 and 2532 weapons 3696. 

18:4 Jesus 2424 therefore 3767, knowing 1492 5761 all things 3956 that should come 2064 5740 upon 1909 him 846, went forth 1831 5631, and said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Whom 5101 seek ye 2212 5719? 

18:5 They answered 611 5662 him 846, Jesus 2424 of Nazareth 3480. Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, I 1473 am 1510 5748 [he]. And 1161 Judas 2455 also 2532, which 3588 betrayed 3860 5723 him 846, stood 2476 5715 with 3326 them 846. 

18:6 As soon 5613 then 3767 as he had said 2036 5627 unto them 846, 3754 I 1473 am 1510 5748 [he], they went 565 5627 backward 1519 3694, and 2532 fell 4098 5627 to the ground 5476. 

18:7 Then 3767 asked he 1905 5656 them 846 again 3825, Whom 5101 seek ye 2212 5719? And 1161 they said 2036 5627, Jesus 2424 of Nazareth 3480. 

18:8 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662, I have told 2036 5627 you 5213 that 3754 I 1473 am 1510 5748 [he]: if 1487 therefore 3767 ye seek 2212 5719 me 1691, let 863 5628 these 5128 go their way 5217 5721: 

18:9 That 2443 the saying 3056 might be fulfilled 4137 5686, which 3739 he spake 2036 5627, 3754 Of 1537 them 846 which 3739 thou gavest 1325 5758 me 3427 have I 3756 lost 622 5656 none 3762. 

18:10 Then 3767 Simon 4613 Peter 4074 having 2192 5723 a sword 3162 drew 1670 5656 it 846, and 2532 smote 3817 5656 the high priest's 749 servant 1401, and 2532 cut off 609 5656 his 846 right 1188 ear 5621. 1161 The servant's 1401 name 3686 was 2258 5713 Malchus 3124. 

18:11 Then 3767 said 2036 5627 Jesus 2424 unto Peter 4074, Put up 906 5628 thy 4675 sword 3162 into 1519 the sheath 2336: the cup 4221 which 3739 my Father 3962 hath given 1325 5758 me 3427, shall I 4095 0 not 3378 drink 4095 5632 it 846? 

18:12 Then 3767 the band 4686 and 2532 the captain 5506 and 2532 officers 5257 of the Jews 2453 took 4815 5627 Jesus 2424, and 2532 bound 1210 5656 him 846, 

18:13 And 2532 led 520 0 him 846 away 520 5627 to 4314 Annas 452 first 4412; for 1063 he was 2258 5713 father in law 3995 to Caiaphas 2533, which 3739 was 2258 5713 the high priest 749 that same 1565 year 1763. 

18:14 Now 1161 Caiaphas 2533 was he 2258 5713, which 3588 gave counsel 4823 5660 to the Jews 2453, that 3754 it was expedient 4851 5719 that one 1520 man 444 should die 622 5641 for 5228 the people 2992. 

18:15 And 1161 Simon 4613 Peter 4074 followed 190 5707 Jesus 2424, and 2532 [so did] another 243 disciple 3101: 1161 that 1565 disciple 3101 was 2258 5713 known 1110 unto the high priest 749, and 2532 went in with 4897 5627 Jesus 2424 into 1519 the palace 833 of the high priest 749. 

18:16 But 1161 Peter 4074 stood 2476 5715 at 4314 the door 2374 without 1854. Then 3767 went out 1831 5627 that other 243 disciple 3101, which 3739 was 2258 5713 known 1110 unto the high priest 749, and 2532 spake 2036 5627 unto her that kept the door 2377, and 2532 brought in 1521 5627 Peter 4074. 

18:17 Then 3767 saith 3004 5719 the damsel 3814 that kept the door 2377 unto Peter 4074, Art 1488 5748 not 3361 thou 4771 also 2532 [one] of 1537 this 5127 man's 444 disciples 3101? He 1565 saith 3004 5719, I am 1510 5748 not 3756. 

18:18 And 1161 the servants 1401 and 2532 officers 5257 stood there 2476 5715, who had made 4160 5761 a fire of coals 439; for 3754 it was 2258 5713 cold 5592: and 2532 they warmed themselves 2328 5711: and 1161 Peter 4074 stood 2258 5713 2476 5761 with 3326 them 846, and 2532 warmed himself 2328 5734. 

18:19 The high priest 749 then 3767 asked 2065 5656 Jesus 2424 of 4012 his 846 disciples 3101, and 2532 of 4012 his 846 doctrine 1322. 

18:20 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 him 846, I 1473 spake 2980 5656 openly 3954 to the world 2889; I 1473 ever 3842 taught 1321 5656 in 1722 the synagogue 4864, and 2532 in 1722 the temple 2411, whither 3699 the Jews 2453 always 3842 resort 4905 5736; and 2532 in 1722 secret 2927 have I said 2980 5656 nothing 3762. 

18:21 Why 5101 askest thou 1905 5719 me 3165? ask 1905 5657 them which heard me 191 5756, what 5101 I have said 2980 5656 unto them 846: behold 2396, they 3778 know 1492 5758 what I 1473 said 2036 5627. 

18:22 And 1161 when he had 2036 0 thus 5023 spoken 2036 5631, one 1520 of the officers 5257 which stood by 3936 5761 struck 1325 0 4475 0 Jesus 2424 with the palm of his hand 1325 5656 4475, saying 2036 5631, Answerest thou 611 5736 the high priest 749 so 3779? 

18:23 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 him 846, If 1487 I have spoken 2980 5656 evil 2560, bear witness 3140 5657 of 4012 the evil 2556: but 1161 if 1487 well 2573, why 5101 smitest 1194 5719 thou me 3165? 

18:24 Now Annas 452 had sent 649 5656 him 846 bound 1210 5772 unto 4314 Caiaphas 2533 the high priest 749. 

18:25 And 1161 Simon 4613 Peter 4074 stood 2258 5713 2476 5761 and 2532 warmed himself 2328 5734. They said 2036 5627 therefore 3767 unto him 846, Art 1488 5748 not 3361 thou 4771 also 2532 [one] of 1537 his 846 disciples 3101? He 1565 denied 720 5662 [it], and 2532 said 2036 5627, I am 1510 5748 not 3756. 

18:26 One 1520 of 1537 the servants 1401 of the high priest 749, being 5607 5752 [his] kinsman 4773 whose 3739 ear 5621 Peter 4074 cut off 609 5656, saith 3004 5719, Did 1492 0 not 3756 I 1473 see 1492 5627 thee 4571 in 1722 the garden 2779 with 3326 him 846? 

18:27 Peter 4074 then 3767 denied 720 5662 again 3825: and 2532 immediately 2112 the cock 220 crew 5455 5656. 

18:28 Then 3767 led they 71 5719 Jesus 2424 from 575 Caiaphas 2533 unto 1519 the hall of judgment 4232: and 1161 it was 2258 5713 early 4405; and 2532 they themselves 846 went 1525 5627 not 3756 into 1519 the judgment hall 4232, lest 3363 they should be defiled 3392 5686; but 235 that 2443 they might eat 5315 5632 the passover 3957. 

18:29 Pilate 4091 then 3767 went out 1831 5627 unto 4314 them 846, and 2532 said 2036 5627, What 5101 accusation 2724 bring ye 5342 5719 against 2596 this 5127 man 444? 

18:30 They answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, If 1508 0 he 3778 were 2258 5713 not 1508 a malefactor 2555, we would 302 not 3756 have delivered 3860 0 him 846 up 3860 5656 unto thee 4671. 

18:31 Then 3767 said 2036 5627 Pilate 4091 unto them 846, Take 2983 5628 ye 5210 him 846, and 2532 judge 2919 5657 him 846 according 2596 to your 5216 law 3551. The Jews 2453 therefore 3767 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, It is 1832 0 not 3756 lawful 1832 5748 for us 2254 to put 615 0 any man 3762 to death 615 5658: 

18:32 That 2443 the saying 3056 of Jesus 2424 might be fulfilled 4137 5686, which 3739 he spake 2036 5627, signifying 4591 5723 what 4169 death 2288 he should 3195 5707 die 599 5721. 

18:33 Then 3767 Pilate 4091 entered 1525 5627 into 1519 the judgment hall 4232 again 3825, and 2532 called 5455 5656 Jesus 2424, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Art 1488 5748 thou 4771 the King 935 of the Jews 2453? 

18:34 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 him 846, Sayest 3004 5719 thou 4771 this thing 5124 of 575 thyself 1438, or 2228 did others 243 tell it 2036 5627 thee 4671 of 4012 me 1700? 

18:35 Pilate 4091 answered 611 5662, 3385 Am 1510 5748 I 1473 a Jew 2453? Thine own 4674 nation 1484 and 2532 the chief priests 749 have delivered 3860 5656 thee 4571 unto me 1698: what 5101 hast thou done 4160 5656? 

18:36 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662, My 1699 kingdom 932 is 2076 5748 not 3756 of 1537 this 5127 world 2889: if 1487 my 1699 kingdom 932 were 2258 5713 of 1537 this 5127 world 2889, then would 302 my 1699 servants 5257 fight 75 5711, that 3363 0 I should 3860 0 not 3363 be delivered 3860 5686 to the Jews 2453: but 1161 now 3568 is 2076 5748 my 1699 kingdom 932 not 3756 from hence 1782. 

18:37 Pilate 4091 therefore 3767 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Art 1488 5748 thou 4771 a king 935 then 3766? Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662, Thou 4771 sayest 3004 5719 that 3754 I 1473 am 1510 5748 a king 935. To 1519 this 5124 end was 1080 0 I 1473 born 1080 5769, and 2532 for 1519 this 5124 cause came I 2064 5754 into 1519 the world 2889, that 2443 I should bear witness 3140 5661 unto the truth 225. Every one 3956 that is 5607 5752 of 1537 the truth 225 heareth 191 5719 my 3450 voice 5456. 

18:38 Pilate 4091 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, What 5101 is 2076 5748 truth 225? And 2532 when he had said 2036 5631 this 5124, he went out 1831 5627 again 3825 unto 4314 the Jews 2453, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, I 1473 find 2147 5719 in 1722 him 846 no 3762 fault 156 [at all]. 

18:39 But 1161 ye 5213 have 2076 5748 a custom 4914, that 2443 I should release 630 5661 unto you 5213 one 1520 at 1722 the passover 3957: will ye 1014 5736 therefore 3767 that I release 630 5661 unto you 5213 the King 935 of the Jews 2453? 

18:40 Then 3767 cried they 2905 5656 all 3956 again 3825, saying 3004 5723, Not 3361 this man 5126, but 235 Barabbas 912. Now 1161 Barabbas 912 was 2258 5713 a robber 3027. 

19:1 Then 5119 Pilate 4091 therefore 3767 took 2983 5627 Jesus 2424, and 2532 scourged 3146 5656 [him]. 

19:2 And 2532 the soldiers 4757 platted 4120 5660 a crown 4735 of 1537 thorns 173, and put [it] on 2007 5656 his 846 head 2776, and 2532 they put on 4016 5627 him 846 a purple 4210 robe 2440, 

19:3 And 2532 said 3004 5707, Hail 5463 5720, King 935 of the Jews 2453! and 2532 they smote 1325 5707 him 846 with their hands 4475. 

19:4 Pilate 4091 therefore 3767 went 1831 5627 forth 1854 again 3825, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Behold 2396, I bring 71 5719 him 846 forth 1854 to you 5213, that 2443 ye may know 1097 5632 that 3754 I find 2147 5719 no 3762 fault 156 in 1722 him 846. 

19:5 Then 3767 came 1831 5627 Jesus 2424 forth 1854, wearing 5409 5723 the crown 4735 of thorns 174, and 2532 the purple 4210 robe 2440. And 2532 [Pilate] saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Behold 2396 the man 444! 

19:6 When 3753 the chief priests 749 therefore 3767 and 2532 officers 5257 saw 1492 5627 him 846, they cried out 2905 5656, saying 3004 5723, Crucify 4717 5657 [him], crucify 4717 5657 [him]. Pilate 4091 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Take 2983 5628 ye 5210 him 846, and 2532 crucify 4717 5657 [him]: for 1063 I 1473 find 2147 5719 no 3756 fault 156 in 1722 him 846. 

19:7 The Jews 2453 answered 611 5662 him 846, We 2249 have 2192 5719 a law 3551, and 2532 by 2596 our 2257 law 3551 he ought 3784 5719 to die 599 5629, because 3754 he made 4160 5656 himself 1438 the Son 5207 of God 2316. 

19:8 When 3753 Pilate 4091 therefore 3767 heard 191 5656 that 5126 saying 3056, he was 5399 0 the more 3123 afraid 5399 5675; 

19:9 And 2532 went 1525 5627 again 3825 into 1519 the judgment hall 4232, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto Jesus 2424, Whence 4159 art 1488 5748 thou 4771? But 1161 Jesus 2424 gave 1325 5656 him 846 no 3756 answer 612. 

19:10 Then 3767 saith 3004 5719 Pilate 4091 unto him 846, Speakest thou 2980 5719 not 3756 unto me 1698? knowest thou 1492 5758 not 3756 that 3754 I have 2192 5719 power 1849 to crucify 4717 5658 thee 4571, and 2532 have 2192 5719 power 1849 to release 630 5658 thee 4571? 

19:11 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662, Thou couldest have 2192 5707 no 3756 power 1849 [at all] against 3762 2596 me 1700, except 1508 it were 2258 5713 given 1325 5772 thee 4671 from above 509: therefore 5124 1223 he that delivered 3860 5723 me 3165 unto thee 4671 hath 2192 5719 the greater 3187 sin 266. 

19:12 And from 1537 thenceforth 5127 Pilate 4091 sought 2212 5707 to release 630 5658 him 846: but 1161 the Jews 2453 cried out 2896 5707, saying 3004 5723, If 1437 thou let 630 0 this man 5126 go 630 5661, thou art 1488 5748 not 3756 Caesar's 2541 friend 5384: whosoever 3956 maketh 4160 5723 himself 848 a king 935 speaketh against 483 5719 Caesar 2541. 

19:13 When Pilate 4091 therefore 3767 heard 191 5660 that 5126 saying 3056, he brought 71 5627 Jesus 2424 forth 1854, and 2532 sat down 2523 5656 in 1909 the judgment seat 968 in 1519 a place 5117 that is called 3004 5746 the Pavement 3038, but 1161 in the Hebrew 1447, Gabbatha 1042. 

19:14 And 1161 it was 2258 5713 the preparation 3904 of the passover 3957, and 1161 about 5616 the sixth 1623 hour 5610: and 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto the Jews 2453, Behold 2396 your 5216 King 935! 

19:15 But 1161 they cried out 2905 5656, Away with 142 5657 [him], away with 142 5657 [him], crucify 4717 5657 him 846. Pilate 4091 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Shall I crucify 4717 5692 your 5216 King 935? The chief priests 749 answered 611 5662, We have 2192 5719 no 3756 king 935 but 1508 Caesar 2541. 

19:16 Then 5119 delivered he 3860 5656 him 846 therefore 3767 unto them 846 to 2443 be crucified 4717 5686. And 1161 they took 3880 5627 Jesus 2424, and 2532 led [him] away 520 5627. 

19:17 And 2532 he bearing 941 5723 his 848 cross 4716 went forth 1831 5627 into 1519 a place 5117 called 3004 5746 [the place] of a skull 2898, which 3739 is called 3004 5743 in the Hebrew 1447 Golgotha 1115: 

19:18 Where 3699 they crucified 4717 5656 him 846, and 2532 two 1417 other 243 with 3326 him 846, on either side one 2532 1782 1782, and 1161 Jesus 2424 in the midst 3319. 

19:19 And 1161 2532 Pilate 4091 wrote 1125 5656 a title 5102, and 2532 put 5087 5656 [it] on 1909 the cross 4716. And 1161 the writing 1125 5772 was 2258 5713, JESUS 2424 OF NAZARETH 3480 THE KING 935 OF THE JEWS 2453. 

19:20 This 5126 title 5102 then 3767 read 314 5627 many 4183 of the Jews 2453: for 3754 the place 5117 where 3699 Jesus 2424 was crucified 4717 5681 was 2258 5713 nigh 1451 to the city 4172: and 2532 it was 2258 5713 written 1125 5772 in Hebrew 1447, [and] Greek 1676, [and] Latin 4515. 

19:21 Then 3767 said 3004 5707 the chief priests 749 of the Jews 2453 to Pilate 4091, Write 1125 5720 not 3361, The King 935 of the Jews 2453; but 235 that 3754 he 1565 said 2036 5627, I am 1510 5748 King 935 of the Jews 2453. 

19:22 Pilate 4091 answered 611 5662, What 3739 I have written 1125 5758 I have written 1125 5758. 

19:23 Then 3767 the soldiers 4757, when 3753 they had crucified 4717 5656 Jesus 2424, took 2983 5627 his 846 garments 2440, and 2532 made 4160 5656 four 5064 parts 3313, to every 1538 soldier 4757 a part 3313; and also 2532 [his] coat 5509: now 1161 the coat 5509 was 2258 5713 without seam 729, woven 5307 from 1537 the top 509 throughout 1223 3650. 

19:24 They said 2036 5627 therefore 3767 among 4314 themselves 240, Let us 4977 0 not 3361 rend 4977 5661 it 846, but 235 cast lots 2975 5632 for 4012 it 846, whose 5101 it shall be 2071 5704: that 2443 the scripture 1124 might be fulfilled 4137 5686, which 3588 saith 3004 5723, They parted 1266 5668 my 3450 raiment 2440 among them 1438, and 2532 for 1909 my 3450 vesture 2441 they did cast 906 5627 lots 2819. These things 5023 3303 therefore 3767 the soldiers 4757 did 4160 5656. 

19:25 Now 1161 there stood 2476 5715 by 3844 the cross 4716 of Jesus 2424 his 846 mother 3384, and 2532 his 846 mother's 3384 sister 79, Mary 3137 the [wife] 3588 of Cleophas 2832, and 2532 Mary 3137 Magdalene 3094. 

19:26 When Jesus 2424 therefore 3767 saw 1492 5631 his mother 3384, and 2532 the disciple 3101 standing by 3936 5761, whom 3739 he loved 25 5707, he saith 3004 5719 unto his 848 mother 3384, Woman 1135, behold 2400 5628 thy 4675 son 5207! 

19:27 Then 1534 saith he 3004 5719 to the disciple 3101, Behold 2400 5628 thy 4675 mother 3384! And 2532 from 575 that 1565 hour 5610 that disciple 3101 took 2983 5627 her 846 unto 1519 his own 2398 [home]. 

19:28 After 3326 this 5124, Jesus 2424 knowing 1492 5761 that 3754 all things 3956 were 5055 0 now 2235 accomplished 5055 5769, that 2443 the scripture 1124 might be fulfilled 5048 5686, saith 3004 5719, I thirst 1372 5719. 

19:29 Now 3767 there was set 2749 5711 a vessel 4632 full 3324 of vinegar 3690: and 1161 they filled 4130 5660 a spunge 4699 with vinegar 3690, and 2532 put [it] upon 4060 5631 hyssop 5301, and put 4374 5656 [it] to his 846 mouth 4750. 

19:30 When 3753 Jesus 2424 therefore 3767 had received 2983 5627 the vinegar 3690, he said 2036 5627, It is finished 5055 5769: and 2532 he bowed 2827 5660 his head 2776, and gave up 3860 5656 the ghost 4151. 

19:31 The Jews 2453 therefore 3767, because 1893 it was 2258 5713 5625 2258 5713 the preparation 3904, that 3363 0 the bodies 4983 should 3306 0 not 3363 remain 3306 5661 upon 1909 the cross 4716 on 1722 the sabbath day 4521, (for 1063 that 1565 sabbath day 4521 was 2258 5713 an high 3173 day 2250) besought 2065 5656 Pilate 4091 that 2443 their 846 legs 4628 might be broken 2608 5652, and 2532 [that] they might be taken away 142 5686. 

19:32 Then 3767 came 2064 5627 the soldiers 4757, and 2532 brake 2608 5656 the legs 4628 of the 3303 first 4413, and 2532 of the other 243 which 3588 was crucified with 4957 5685 him 846. 

19:33 But 1161 when 5613 they came 2064 5631 to 1909 Jesus 2424, and saw 1492 5627 that he 846 was dead 2348 5761 already 2235, they brake 2608 5656 not 3756 his 846 legs 4628: 

19:34 But 235 one 1520 of the soldiers 4757 with a spear 3057 pierced 3572 5656 his 846 side 4125, and 2532 forthwith 2117 came there out 1831 5627 blood 129 and 2532 water 5204. 

19:35 And 2532 he that saw 3708 5761 [it] bare record 3140 5758, and 2532 his 846 record 3141 is 2076 5748 true 228: and he 2548 knoweth 1492 5758 that 3754 he saith 3004 5719 true 227, that 2443 ye 5210 might believe 4100 5661. 

19:36 For 1063 these things 5023 were done 1096 5633, that 2443 the scripture 1124 should be fulfilled 4137 5686, A bone 3747 of him 846 shall 4937 0 not 3756 be broken 4937 5691. 

19:37 And 2532 again 3825 another 2087 scripture 1124 saith 3004 5719, They shall look 3700 5695 on 1519 him whom 3739 they pierced 1574 5656. 

19:38 And 1161 after 3326 this 5023 Joseph 2501 of 575 Arimathaea 707, being 5607 5752 a disciple 3101 of Jesus 2424, but 1161 secretly 2928 5772 for 1223 fear 5401 of the Jews 2453, besought 2065 5656 Pilate 4091 that 2443 he might take away 142 5661 the body 4983 of Jesus 2424: and 2532 Pilate 4091 gave [him] leave 2010 5656. He came 2064 5627 therefore 3767, and 2532 took 142 5656 the body 4983 of Jesus 2424. 

19:39 And 1161 there came 2064 5627 also 2532 Nicodemus 3530, which 3588 at the first 4412 came 2064 5631 to 4314 Jesus 2424 by night 3571, and brought 5342 5723 a mixture 3395 of myrrh 4666 and 2532 aloes 250, about 5616 an hundred 1540 pound 3046 [weight]. 

19:40 Then 3767 took they 2983 5627 the body 4983 of Jesus 2424, and 2532 wound 1210 5656 it 846 in linen clothes 3608 with 3326 the spices 759, as 2531 the manner 1485 of the Jews 2453 is 2076 5748 to bury 1779 5721. 

19:41 Now 1161 in 1722 the place 5117 where 3699 he was crucified 4717 5681 there was 2258 5713 a garden 2779; and 2532 in 1722 the garden 2779 a new 2537 sepulchre 3419, wherein 1722 3739 was 5087 0 never 3764 0 man 3762 yet 3764 laid 5087 5681. 

19:42 There 1563 laid they 5087 5656 Jesus 2424 therefore 3767 because 1223 of the Jews 2453' preparation 3904 [day]; for 3754 the sepulchre 3419 was 2258 5713 nigh at hand 1451. 

20:1 1161 The first 3391 [day] of the week 4521 cometh 2064 5736 Mary 3137 Magdalene 3094 early 4404, when it was 5607 5752 yet 2089 dark 4653, unto 1519 the sepulchre 3419, and 2532 seeth 991 5719 the stone 3037 taken away 142 5772 from 1537 the sepulchre 3419. 

20:2 Then 3767 she runneth 5143 5719, and 2532 cometh 2064 5736 to 4314 Simon 4613 Peter 4074, and 2532 to 4314 the other 243 disciple 3101, whom 3739 Jesus 2424 loved 5368 5707, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, They have taken away 142 5656 the Lord 2962 out of 1537 the sepulchre 3419, and 2532 we know 1492 5758 not 3756 where 4226 they have laid 5087 5656 him 846. 

20:3 Peter 4074 therefore 3767 went forth 1831 5627, and 2532 that other 243 disciple 3101, and 2532 came 2064 5711 to 1519 the sepulchre 3419. 

20:4 So 1161 they ran 5143 5707 both 1417 together 3674: and 2532 the other 243 disciple 3101 did outrun 4390 5627 5032 Peter 4074, and 2532 came 2064 5627 first 4413 to 1519 the sepulchre 3419. 

20:5 And 2532 he stooping down 3879 5660, [and looking in], saw 991 5719 the linen clothes 3608 lying 2749 5740; yet 3305 went he 1525 0 not 3756 in 1525 5627. 

20:6 Then 3767 cometh 2064 5736 Simon 4613 Peter 4074 following 190 5723 him 846, and 2532 went 1525 5627 into 1519 the sepulchre 3419, and 2532 seeth 2334 5719 the linen clothes 3608 lie 2749 5740, 

20:7 And 2532 the napkin 4676, that was 2258 5713 about 1909 his head 2776, not 3756 lying 2749 5740 with 3326 the linen clothes 3608, but 235 wrapped together 1794 5772 in 1519 a place 5117 by itself 1520 5565. 

20:8 Then 5119 3767 went in 1525 5627 also 2532 that other 243 disciple 3101, which 3588 came 2064 5631 first 4413 to 1519 the sepulchre 3419, and 2532 he saw 1492 5627, and 2532 believed 4100 5656. 

20:9 For 1063 as yet 3764 0 they knew 1492 5715 not 3764 the scripture 1124, that 3754 he must 1163 5748 rise again 450 5629 from 1537 the dead 3498. 

20:10 Then 3767 the disciples 3101 went away 565 5627 again 3825 unto 4314 their own home 1438. 

20:11 But 1161 Mary 3137 stood 2476 5715 without 1854 at 4314 the sepulchre 3419 weeping 2799 5723: and 3767 as 5613 she wept 2799 5707, she stooped down 3879 5656, [and looked] into 1519 the sepulchre 3419, 

20:12 And 2532 seeth 2334 5719 two 1417 angels 32 in 1722 white 3022 sitting 2516 5740, the one 1520 at 4314 the head 2776, and 2532 the other 1520 at 4314 the feet 4228, where 3699 the body 4983 of Jesus 2424 had lain 2749 5711. 

20:13 And 2532 they 1565 say 3004 5719 unto her 846, Woman 1135, why 5101 weepest thou 2799 5719? She saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Because 3754 they have taken away 142 5656 my 3450 Lord 2962, and 2532 I know 1492 5758 not 3756 where 4226 they have laid 5087 5656 him 846. 

20:14 And 2532 when she had 2036 0 thus 5023 said 2036 5631, she turned 4762 5648 herself 1519 back 3694, and 2532 saw 2334 5719 Jesus 2424 standing 2476 5761, and 2532 knew 1492 5715 not 3756 that 3754 it was 2076 5748 Jesus 2424. 

20:15 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto her 846, Woman 1135, why 5101 weepest thou 2799 5719? whom 5101 seekest thou 2212 5719? She 1565, supposing 1380 5723 3754 him to be 2076 5748 the gardener 2780, saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Sir 2962, if 1487 thou 4771 have borne 941 0 him 846 hence 941 5656, tell 2036 5628 me 3427 where 4226 thou hast laid 5087 5656 him 846, and I 2504 will take 142 0 him 846 away 142 5692. 

20:16 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto her 846, Mary 3137. She 1565 turned 4762 5651 herself, and saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Rabboni 4462; which 3739 is to say 3004 5743, Master 1320. 

20:17 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto her 846, Touch 680 5732 me 3450 not 3361; for 1063 I am 305 0 not yet 3768 ascended 305 5758 to 4314 my 3450 Father 3962: but 1161 go 4198 5737 to 4314 my 3450 brethren 80, and 2532 say 2036 5628 unto them 846, I ascend 305 5719 unto 4314 my 3450 Father 3962, and 2532 your 5216 Father 3962; and 2532 [to] my 3450 God 2316, and 2532 your 5216 God 2316. 

20:18 Mary 3137 Magdalene 3094 came 2064 5736 and told 518 5723 the disciples 3101 that 3754 she had seen 3708 5758 the Lord 2962, and 2532 [that] he had spoken 2036 5627 these things 5023 unto her 846. 

20:19 Then 3767 the same 1565 day 2250 at evening 3798, being 5607 5752 the first 3391 [day] of the week 4521, when 2532 the doors 2374 were shut 2808 5772 where 3699 the disciples 3101 were 2258 5713 assembled 4863 5772 for 1223 fear 5401 of the Jews 2453, came 2064 5627 Jesus 2424 and 2532 stood 2476 5627 in 1519 the midst 3319, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Peace 1515 [be] unto you 5213. 

20:20 And 2532 when he had 2036 0 so 5124 said 2036 5631, he shewed 1166 5656 unto them 846 [his] hands 5495 and 2532 his 848 side 4125. Then 3767 were 5463 0 the disciples 3101 glad 5463 5644, when they saw 1492 5631 the Lord 2962. 

20:21 Then 3767 said 2036 5627 Jesus 2424 to them 846 again 3825, Peace 1515 [be] unto you 5213: as 2531 [my] Father 3962 hath sent 649 5758 me 3165, even so 2504 0 send 3992 5719 I 2504 you 5209. 

20:22 And 2532 when he had said 2036 5631 this 5124, he breathed on 1720 5656 [them], and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Receive ye 2983 5628 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151: 

20:23 Whose 5100 soever 302 sins 266 ye remit 863 5632, they are remitted 863 5743 unto them 846; [and] whose 5100 soever 302 [sins] ye retain 2902 5725, they are retained 2902 5769. 

20:24 But 1161 Thomas 2381, one 1520 of 1537 the twelve 1427, called 3004 5746 Didymus 1324, was 2258 5713 not 3756 with 3326 them 846 when 3753 Jesus 2424 came 2064 5627. 

20:25 The other 243 disciples 3101 therefore 3767 said 3004 5707 unto him 846, We have seen 3708 5758 the Lord 2962. But 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Except 3362 I shall see 1492 5632 in 1722 his 846 hands 5495 the print 5179 of the nails 2247, and 2532 put 906 5632 my 3450 finger 1147 into 1519 the print 5179 of the nails 2247, and 2532 thrust 906 5632 my 3450 hand 5495 into 1519 his 846 side 4125, I will 4100 0 not 3364 believe 4100 5692 5661. 

20:26 And 2532 after 3326 eight 3638 days 2250 again 3825 his 846 disciples 3101 were 2258 5713 within 2080, and 2532 Thomas 2381 with 3326 them 846: [then] came 2064 5736 Jesus 2424, the doors 2374 being shut 2808 5772, and 2532 stood 2476 5627 in 1519 the midst 3319, and 2532 said 2036 5627, Peace 1515 [be] unto you 5213. 

20:27 Then 1534 saith he 3004 5719 to Thomas 2381, Reach 5342 5720 hither 5602 thy 4675 finger 1147, and 2532 behold 1492 5657 my 3450 hands 5495; and 2532 reach hither 5342 5720 thy 4675 hand 5495, and 2532 thrust 906 5628 [it] into 1519 my 3450 side 4125: and 2532 be 1096 5737 not 3361 faithless 571, but 235 believing 4103. 

20:28 And 2532 Thomas 2381 answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, My 3450 Lord 2962 and 2532 my 3450 God 2316. 

20:29 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Thomas 2381, because 3754 thou hast seen 3708 5758 me 3165, thou hast believed 4100 5758: blessed 3107 [are] they that have not 3361 seen 1492 5631, and 2532 [yet] have believed 4100 5660. 

20:30 And 2532 many 4183 other 243 signs 4592 truly 3303 3767 did 4160 5656 Jesus 2424 in the presence 1799 of his 848 disciples 3101, which 3739 are 2076 5748 not 3756 written 1125 5772 in 1722 this 5129 book 975: 

20:31 But 1161 these 5023 are written 1125 5769, that 2443 ye might believe 4100 5661 that 3754 Jesus 2424 is 2076 5748 the Christ 5547, the Son 5207 of God 2316; and 2532 that 2443 believing 4100 5723 ye might have 2192 5725 life 2222 through 1722 his 846 name 3686. 

21:1 After 3326 these things 5023 Jesus 2424 shewed 5319 5656 himself 1438 again 3825 to the disciples 3101 at 1909 the sea 2281 of Tiberias 5085; and 1161 on this wise 3779 shewed 5319 5656 he [himself]. 

21:2 There were 2258 5713 together 3674 Simon 4613 Peter 4074, and 2532 Thomas 2381 called 3004 5746 Didymus 1324, and 2532 Nathanael 3482 of 575 Cana 2580 in Galilee 1056, and 2532 the [sons] 3588 of Zebedee 2199, and 2532 two 1417 other 243 of 1537 his 846 disciples 3101. 

21:3 Simon 4613 Peter 4074 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, I go 5217 5719 a fishing 232 5721. They say 3004 5719 unto him 846, We 2249 also 2532 go 2064 5736 with 4862 thee 4671. They went forth 1831 5627, and 2532 entered 305 5627 into 1519 a ship 4143 immediately 2117; and 2532 that 1722 1565 night 3571 they caught 4084 5656 nothing 3762. 

21:4 But 1161 when the morning 4405 was 1096 0 now 2235 come 1096 5637, Jesus 2424 stood 2476 5627 on 1519 the shore 123: but 3305 the disciples 3101 knew 1492 5715 not 3756 that 3754 it was 2076 5748 Jesus 2424. 

21:5 Then 3767 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Children 3813, have ye 2192 5719 any 3387 meat 4371? They answered 611 5662 him 846, No 3756. 

21:6 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Cast 906 5628 the net 1350 on 1519 the right 1188 side 3313 of the ship 4143, and 2532 ye shall find 2147 5692. They cast 906 5627 therefore 3767, and 2532 now 2089 they were 2480 0 not 3765 able 2480 5656 to draw 1670 5658 it 846 for 575 the multitude 4128 of fishes 2486. 

21:7 Therefore 3767 that 1565 disciple 3101 whom 3739 Jesus 2424 loved 25 5707 saith 3004 5719 unto Peter 4074, It is 2076 5748 the Lord 2962. Now 3767 when Simon 4613 Peter 4074 heard 191 5660 that 3754 it was 2076 5748 the Lord 2962, he girt 1241 5668 [his] fisher's coat 1903 [unto him], (for 1063 he was 2258 5713 naked 1131) and 2532 did cast 906 5627 himself 1438 into 1519 the sea 2281. 

21:8 And 1161 the other 243 disciples 3101 came 2064 5627 in a little ship 4142; (for 1063 they were 2258 5713 not 3756 far 3112 from 575 land 1093, but 235 as it were 5613 575 two hundred 1250 cubits 4083) dragging 4951 5723 the net 1350 with fishes 2486. 

21:9 As soon 5613 then 3767 as they were come 576 5627 to 1519 land 1093, they saw 991 5719 a fire of coals 439 there, and 2532 fish 3795 laid 2749 5740 thereon 1945 5740, and 2532 bread 740. 

21:10 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Bring 5342 5657 of 575 the fish 3795 which 3739 ye have 4084 0 now 3568 caught 4084 5656. 

21:11 Simon 4613 Peter 4074 went up 305 5627, and 2532 drew 1670 5656 the net 1350 to 1909 land 1093 full 3324 of great 3173 fishes 2486, an hundred 1540 and fifty 4004 and three 5140: and 2532 for all there were so many 5118, yet was 5607 5752 not 3756 the net 1350 broken 4977 5681. 

21:12 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Come 1205 5773 [and] dine 709 5657. And 1161 none 3762 of the disciples 3101 durst 5111 5707 ask 1833 5658 him 846, Who 5101 art 1488 5748 thou 4771? knowing 1492 5761 that 3754 it was 2076 5748 the Lord 2962. 

21:13 Jesus 2424 then 3767 cometh 2064 5736, and 2532 taketh 2983 5719 bread 740, and 2532 giveth 1325 5719 them 846, and 2532 fish 3795 likewise 3668. 

21:14 This 5124 is 5319 0 now 2235 the third time 5154 that Jesus 2424 shewed himself 5319 5681 to his 848 disciples 3101, after that he was risen 1453 5685 from 1537 the dead 3498. 

21:15 So 3767 when 3753 they had dined 709 5656, Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 to Simon 4613 Peter 4074, Simon 4613, [son] of Jonas 2495, lovest thou 25 5719 me 3165 more than 4119 these 5130? He saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Yea 3483, Lord 2962; thou 4771 knowest 1492 5758 that 3754 I love 5368 5719 thee 4571. He saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Feed 1006 5720 my 3450 lambs 721. 

21:16 He saith 3004 5719 to him 846 again 3825 the second time 1208, Simon 4613, [son] of Jonas 2495, lovest thou 25 5719 me 3165? He saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Yea 3483, Lord 2962; thou 4771 knowest 1492 5758 that 3754 I love 5368 5719 thee 4571. He saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Feed 4165 5720 my 3450 sheep 4263. 

21:17 He saith 3004 5719 unto him 846 the third 5154 time, Simon 4613, [son] of Jonas 2495, lovest 5368 5719 thou me 3165? Peter 4074 was grieved 3076 5681 because 3754 he said 2036 5627 unto him 846 the third 5154 time, Lovest 5368 5719 thou me 3165? And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Lord 2962, thou 4771 knowest 1492 5758 all things 3956; thou 4771 knowest 1097 5719 that 3754 I love 5368 5719 thee 4571. Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Feed 1006 5720 my 3450 sheep 4263. 

21:18 Verily 281, verily 281, I say 3004 5719 unto thee 4671, When 3753 thou wast 2258 5713 young 3501, thou girdedst 2224 5707 thyself 4572, and 2532 walkedst 4043 5707 whither 3699 thou wouldest 2309 5707: but 1161 when 3752 thou shalt be old 1095 5661, thou shalt stretch forth 1614 5692 thy 4675 hands 5495, and 2532 another 243 shall gird 2224 5692 thee 4571, and 2532 carry 5342 5692 [thee] whither 3699 thou wouldest 2309 5719 not 3756. 

21:19 1161 This 5124 spake he 2036 5627, signifying 4591 5723 by what 4169 death 2288 he should glorify 1392 5692 God 2316. And 2532 when he had spoken 2036 5631 this 5124, he saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Follow 190 5720 me 3427. 

21:20 Then 1161 Peter 4074, turning about 1994 5651, seeth 991 5719 the disciple 3101 whom 3739 Jesus 2424 loved 25 5707 following 190 5723; which 3739 also 2532 leaned 377 5627 on 1909 his 846 breast 4738 at 1722 supper 1173, and 2532 said 2036 5627, Lord 2962, which 5101 is he 2076 5748 that betrayeth 3860 5723 thee 4571? 

21:21 Peter 4074 seeing 1492 5631 him 5126 saith 3004 5719 to Jesus 2424, Lord 2962, and 1161 what 5101 [shall] this man 3778 [do]? 

21:22 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, If 1437 I will 2309 5725 that he tarry 3306 5721 till 2193 I come 2064 5736, what 5101 [is that] to 4314 thee 4571? follow 190 5720 thou 4771 me 3427. 

21:23 Then 3767 went 1831 0 this 3778 saying 3056 abroad 1831 5627 among 1519 the brethren 80, that 3754 that 1565 disciple 3101 should 599 0 not 3756 die 599 5719: yet 2532 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 not 3756 unto him 846, 3754 He shall 599 0 not 3756 die 599 5719; but 235, If 1437 I will 2309 5725 that he 846 tarry 3306 5721 till 2193 I come 2064 5736, what 5101 [is that] to 4314 thee 4571? 

21:24 This 3778 is 2076 5748 the disciple 3101 which 3588 testifieth 3140 5723 of 4012 these things 5130, and 2532 wrote 1125 5660 these things 5023: and 2532 we know 1492 5758 that 3754 his 846 testimony 3141 is 2076 5748 true 227. 

21:25 And 1161 there are 2076 5748 also 2532 many 4183 other things 243 which 3745 Jesus 2424 did 4160 5656, the which 3748, if 1437 they should be written 1125 5747 every 2596 one 1520, I suppose 3633 5736 that even 3761 0 the world 2889 itself 846 could not 3761 contain 5562 5658 the books 975 that should be written 1125 5746. Amen 281.
