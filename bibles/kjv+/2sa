1:1 Now it came to pass after 310 the death 4194 of Saul, 7586 when David 1732 was returned 7725-1 from the slaughter 5221-53 of the Amalekites, 6002 and David 1732 had abode 3427-4 two 8147 days 3117 in Ziklag; 6860

1:2 It came even to pass on the third 7992 day, 3117 that, behold, a man 376 came 935-6 out of the camp 4264 from Saul 7586 with his clothes 899 rent, 7167-7 and earth 127 upon his head: 7218 and [so] it was, when he came 935-2 to David, 1732 that he fell 5307-4 to the earth, 776 and did obeisance. 7812-101

1:3 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto him, From whence comest 935-4 thou? And he said 559-4 unto him, Out of the camp 4264 of Israel 3478 am I escaped. 4422-8

1:4 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto him, How 4100 went the matter? 1697 I pray thee, tell 5046-54 me. And he answered, 559-4 That the people 5971 are fled 5127-1 from the battle, 4421 and many 7235-53 of the people 5971 also are fallen 5307-1 and dead; 4191-4 and Saul 7586 and Jonathan 3083 his son 1121 are dead 4191-1 also.

1:5 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto the young man 5288 that told 5046-56 him, How knowest 3045-1 thou that Saul 7586 and Jonathan 3083 his son 1121 be dead? 4191-1

1:6 And the young man 5288 that told 5046-56 him said, 559-4 As I happened 7136-8 by chance 7122-9 upon mount 2022 Gilboa, 1533 behold, Saul 7586 leaned 8172-12 upon his spear; 2595 and, lo, the chariots 7393 and horsemen 1167 6571 followed hard 1692-52 after him.

1:7 And when he looked 6437-4 behind 310 him, he saw 7200-4 me, and called 7121-4 unto me. And I answered, 559-4 Here [am] I.

1:8 And he said 559-4 unto me, Who [art] thou? And I answered 559-4 him, I [am] an Amalekite. 6003

1:9 He said 559-4 unto me again, Stand, 5975-3 I pray thee, upon me, and slay 4191-33 me: for anguish 7661 is come upon me, 270-1 because my life 5315 [is] yet whole in me.

1:10 So I stood 5975-4 upon him, and slew 4191-34 him, because I was sure 3045-1 that he could not live 2421-4 after 310 that he was fallen: 5307-2 and I took 3947-4 the crown 5145 that [was] upon his head, 7218 and the bracelet 685 that [was] on his arm, 2220 and have brought 935-55 them hither unto my lord. 113

1:11 Then David 1732 took hold 2388-55 on his clothes, 899 and rent 7167-4 them; and likewise all the men 582 that [were] with him:

1:12 And they mourned, 5594-4 and wept, 1058-4 and fasted 6684-4 until even, 6153 for Saul, 7586 and for Jonathan 3083 his son, 1121 and for the people 5971 of the LORD, 3068 and for the house 1004 of Israel; 3478 because they were fallen 5307-1 by the sword. 2719

1:13 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto the young man 5288 that told 5046-56 him, Whence [art] thou? And he answered, 559-4 I [am] the son 1121 of a stranger, 376 1616 an Amalekite. 6003

1:14 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto him, How wast thou not afraid 3372-1 to stretch forth 7971-2 thine hand 3027 to destroy 7843-15 the LORD'S 3068 anointed? 4899

1:15 And David 1732 called 7121-4 one 259 of the young men, 5288 and said, 559-4 Go near, 5066-3 [and] fall 6293-3 upon him. And he smote 5221-55 him that he died. 4191-4

1:16 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto him, Thy blood 1818 [be] upon thy head; 7218 for thy mouth 6310 hath testified 6030-1 against thee, saying, 559-2 I have slain 4191-31 the LORD'S 3068 anointed. 4899

1:17 And David 1732 lamented 6969-34 with this lamentation 7015 over Saul 7586 and over Jonathan 3083 his son: 1121

1:18 (Also he bade 559-4 them teach 3925-15 the children 1121 of Judah 3063 [the use of] the bow: 7198 behold, [it is] written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of Jasher.) 3477

1:19 The beauty 6643 of Israel 3478 is slain 2491 upon thy high places: 1116 how are the mighty 1368 fallen! 5307-1

1:20 Tell 5046-55 [it] not in Gath, 1661 publish 1319-17 [it] not in the streets 2351 of Askelon; 831 lest the daughters 1323 of the Philistines 6430 rejoice, 8055-4 lest the daughters 1323 of the uncircumcised 6189 triumph. 5937-4

1:21 Ye mountains 2022 of Gilboa, 1533 [let there be] no dew, 2919 neither [let there be] rain, 4306 upon you, nor fields 7704 of offerings: 8641 for there the shield 4043 of the mighty 1368 is vilely cast away, 1602-8 the shield 4043 of Saul, 7586 [as though he had] not [been] anointed 4899 with oil. 8081

1:22 From the blood 1818 of the slain, 2491 from the fat 2459 of the mighty, 1368 the bow 7198 of Jonathan 3083 turned 7734-8 not back, 268 and the sword 2719 of Saul 7586 returned 7725-4 not empty. 7387

1:23 Saul 7586 and Jonathan 3083 [were] lovely 157-12 and pleasant 5273 in their lives, 2416 and in their death 4194 they were not divided: 6504-8 they were swifter 7043-1 than eagles, 5404 they were stronger 1396-1 than lions. 738

1:24 Ye daughters 1323 of Israel, 3478 weep 1058-3 over Saul, 7586 who clothed 3847-56 you in scarlet, 8144 with [other] delights, 5730 who put 5927-56 on ornaments 5716 of gold 2091 upon your apparel. 3830

1:25 How are the mighty 1368 fallen 5307-1 in the midst 8432 of the battle! 4421 O Jonathan, 3083 [thou wast] slain 2491 in thine high places. 1116

1:26 I am distressed 6887-1 for thee, my brother 251 Jonathan: 3083 very 3966 pleasant 5276-1 hast thou been unto me: thy love 160 to me was wonderful, 6381-8 passing the love 160 of women. 802

1:27 How are the mighty 1368 fallen, 5307-1 and the weapons 3627 of war 4421 perished! 6-4

2:1 And it came to pass after 310 this, that David 1732 enquired 7592-4 of the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 Shall I go up 5927-4 into any 259 of the cities 5892 of Judah? 3063 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, Go up. 5927-3 And David 1732 said, 559-4 Whither shall I go up? 5927-4 And he said, 559-4 Unto Hebron. 2275

2:2 So David 1732 went up 5927-4 thither, and his two 8147 wives 802 also, Ahinoam 293 the Jezreelitess, 3159 and Abigail 26 Nabal's 5037 wife 802 the Carmelite. 3761

2:3 And his men 582 that [were] with him did David 1732 bring up, 5927-52 every man 376 with his household: 1004 and they dwelt 3427-4 in the cities 5892 of Hebron. 2275

2:4 And the men 582 of Judah 3063 came, 935-4 and there they anointed 4886-4 David 1732 king 4428 over the house 1004 of Judah. 3063 And they told 5046-55 David, 1732 saying, 559-2 [That] the men 582 of Jabeshgilead 3003 1568 [were they] that buried 6912-1 Saul. 7586

2:5 And David 1732 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 unto the men 582 of Jabeshgilead, 3003 1568 and said 559-4 unto them, Blessed 1288-7 [be] ye of the LORD, 3068 that ye have shewed 6213-1 this kindness 2617 unto your lord, 113 [even] unto Saul, 7586 and have buried 6912-4 him.

2:6 And now the LORD 3068 shew 6213-4 kindness 2617 and truth 571 unto you: and I also will requite 6213-4 you this kindness, 2896 because ye have done 6213-1 this thing. 1697

2:7 Therefore now let your hands 3027 be strengthened, 2388-4 and be ye valiant: 1121 2428 for your master 113 Saul 7586 is dead, 4191-1 and also the house 1004 of Judah 3063 have anointed 4886-1 me king 4428 over them.

2:8 But Abner 74 the son 1121 of Ner, 5369 captain 8269 of Saul's 7586 host, 6635 took 3947-1 Ishbosheth 378 the son 1121 of Saul, 7586 and brought him over 5674-55 to Mahanaim; 4266

2:9 And made him king 4427-55 over Gilead, 1568 and over the Ashurites, 805 and over Jezreel, 3157 and over Ephraim, 669 and over Benjamin, 1144 and over all Israel. 3478

2:10 Ishbosheth 378 Saul's 7586 son 1121 [was] forty 705 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign 4427-2 over Israel, 3478 and reigned 4427-1 two 8147 years. 8141 But the house 1004 of Judah 3063 followed 310 David. 1732

2:11 And the time 4557 3117 that David 1732 was king 4428 in Hebron 2275 over the house 1004 of Judah 3063 was seven 7651 years 8141 and six 8337 months. 2320

2:12 And Abner 74 the son 1121 of Ner, 5369 and the servants 5650 of Ishbosheth 378 the son 1121 of Saul, 7586 went out 3318-4 from Mahanaim 4266 to Gibeon. 1391

2:13 And Joab 3097 the son 1121 of Zeruiah, 6870 and the servants 5650 of David, 1732 went out, 3318-1 and met 6298-4 together 3162 by the pool 1295 of Gibeon: 1391 and they sat down, 3427-4 the one on the one side of the pool, 1295 and the other on the other side of the pool. 1295

2:14 And Abner 74 said 559-4 to Joab, 3097 Let the young men 5288 now arise, 6965-4 and play 7832-17 before 6440 us. And Joab 3097 said, 559-4 Let them arise. 6965-4

2:15 Then there arose 6965-4 and went over 5674-4 by number 4557 twelve 8147 6240 of Benjamin, 1144 which [pertained] to Ishbosheth 378 the son 1121 of Saul, 7586 and twelve 8147 6240 of the servants 5650 of David. 1732

2:16 And they caught 2388-55 every one 376 his fellow 7453 by the head, 7218 and [thrust] his sword 2719 in his fellow's 7453 side; 6654 so they fell down 5307-4 together: 3162 wherefore that place 4725 was called 7121-4 Helkathhazzurim, 2513|6697|2521 which [is] in Gibeon. 1391

2:17 And there was a very 3966 sore 7186 battle 4421 that day; 3117 and Abner 74 was beaten, 5062-11 and the men 582 of Israel, 3478 before 6440 the servants 5650 of David. 1732

2:18 And there were three 7969 sons 1121 of Zeruiah 6870 there, Joab, 3097 and Abishai, 52 and Asahel: 6214 and Asahel 6214 [was as] light 7031 of foot 7272 as a 259 wild 7704 roe. 6643

2:19 And Asahel 6214 pursued 7291-4 after 310 Abner; 74 and in going 3212-2 he turned 5186-1 not to the right hand 3225 nor to the left 8040 from following 310 Abner. 74

2:20 Then Abner 74 looked 6437-4 behind 310 him, and said, 559-4 [Art] thou Asahel? 6214 And he answered, 559-4 I [am].

2:21 And Abner 74 said 559-4 to him, Turn thee aside 5186-3 to thy right hand 3225 or to thy left, 8040 and lay thee hold 270-3 on one 259 of the young men, 5288 and take 3947-3 thee his armour. 2488 But Asahel 6214 would 14-1 not turn aside 5493-2 from following 310 of him.

2:22 And Abner 74 said 559-2 again 3254-55 to Asahel, 6214 Turn thee aside 5493-3 from following 310 me: wherefore should I smite 5221-55 thee to the ground? 776 how then should I hold up 5375-4 my face 6440 to Joab 3097 thy brother? 251

2:23 Howbeit he refused 3985-17 to turn aside: 5493-2 wherefore Abner 74 with the hinder end 310 of the spear 2595 smote 5221-55 him under 413 the fifth 2570 [rib], that the spear 2595 came out 3318-4 behind 310 him; and he fell down 5307-4 there, and died 4191-4 in the same place: 8478 and it came to pass, [that] as many as came 935-6 to the place 4725 where Asahel 6214 fell down 5307-1 and died 4191-4 stood still. 5975-4

2:24 Joab 3097 also and Abishai 52 pursued 7291-4 after 310 Abner: 74 and the sun 8121 went down 935-1 when they were come 935-1 to the hill 1389 of Ammah, 522 that [lieth] before 6440 Giah 1520 by the way 1870 of the wilderness 4057 of Gibeon. 1391

2:25 And the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 gathered themselves together 6908-101 after 310 Abner, 74 and became one 259 troop, 92 and stood 5975-4 on the top 7218 of an 259 hill. 1389

2:26 Then Abner 74 called 7121-4 to Joab, 3097 and said, 559-4 Shall the sword 2719 devour 398-4 for ever? 5331 knowest 3045-1 thou not that it will be bitterness 4751 in the latter end? 314 how long shall it be then, ere thou bid 559-4 the people 5971 return 7725-2 from following 310 their brethren? 251

2:27 And Joab 3097 said, 559-4 [As] God 430 liveth, 2416 unless 3884 thou hadst spoken, 1696-14 surely then in the morning 1242 the people 5971 had gone up 5927-8 every one 376 from following 310 his brother. 251

2:28 So Joab 3097 blew 8628-4 a trumpet, 7782 and all the people 5971 stood still, 5975-4 and pursued 7291-4 after 310 Israel 3478 no more, neither fought 3898-9 they any more. 3254-1

2:29 And Abner 74 and his men 582 walked 1980-1 all that night 3915 through the plain, 6160 and passed over 5674-4 Jordan, 3383 and went through 3212-4 all Bithron, 1338 and they came 935-4 to Mahanaim. 4266

2:30 And Joab 3097 returned 7725-1 from following 310 Abner: 74 and when he had gathered all the people 5971 together, 6908-4 there lacked 6485-11 of David's 1732 servants 5650 nineteen 8672 6240 men 376 and Asahel. 6214

2:31 But the servants 5650 of David 1732 had smitten 5221-52 of Benjamin, 1144 and of Abner's 74 men, 582 [so that] three 7969 hundred 3967 and threescore 8346 men 376 died. 4191-1

2:32 And they took up 5375-4 Asahel, 6214 and buried 6912-4 him in the sepulchre 6913 of his father, 1 which [was in] Bethlehem. 1035 And Joab 3097 and his men 582 went 3212-4 all night, 3915 and they came to Hebron 2275 at break of day. 215-11

3:1 Now there was long 752 war 4421 between the house 1004 of Saul 7586 and the house 1004 of David: 1732 but David 1732 waxed stronger 1980-6 and stronger, 2390 and the house 1004 of Saul 7586 waxed weaker 1980-6 and weaker. 1800

3:2 And unto David 1732 were sons 1121 born 3205-11|3205-27-k in Hebron: 2275 and his firstborn 1060 was Amnon, 550 of Ahinoam 293 the Jezreelitess; 3159

3:3 And his second, 4932 Chileab, 3609 of Abigail 26 the wife 802 of Nabal 5037 the Carmelite; 3761 and the third, 7992 Absalom 53 the son 1121 of Maacah 4601 the daughter 1323 of Talmai 8526 king 4428 of Geshur; 1650

3:4 And the fourth, 7243 Adonijah 138 the son 1121 of Haggith; 2294 and the fifth, 2549 Shephatiah 8203 the son 1121 of Abital; 37

3:5 And the sixth, 8345 Ithream, 3507 by Eglah 5698 David's 1732 wife. 802 These were born 3205-27 to David 1732 in Hebron. 2275

3:6 And it came to pass, while there was war 4421 between the house 1004 of Saul 7586 and the house 1004 of David, 1732 that Abner 74 made himself strong 2388-102 for the house 1004 of Saul. 7586

3:7 And Saul 7586 had a concubine, 6370 whose name 8034 [was] Rizpah, 7532 the daughter 1323 of Aiah: 345 and [Ishbosheth] said 559-4 to Abner, 74 Wherefore hast thou gone in 935-1 unto my father's 1 concubine? 6370

3:8 Then was Abner 74 very 3966 wroth 2734-4 for the words 1697 of Ishbosheth, 378 and said, 559-4 [Am] I a dog's 3611 head, 7218 which against Judah 3063 do shew 6213-4 kindness 2617 this day 3117 unto the house 1004 of Saul 7586 thy father, 1 to his brethren, 251 and to his friends, 4828 and have not delivered 4672-52 thee into the hand 3027 of David, 1732 that thou chargest 6485-4 me to day 3117 with a fault 5771 concerning this woman? 802

3:9 So do 6213-4 God 430 to Abner, 74 and more 3254-55 also, except, as the LORD 3068 hath sworn 7650-8 to David, 1732 even so I do 6213-4 to him;

3:10 To translate 5674-53 the kingdom 4467 from the house 1004 of Saul, 7586 and to set up 6965-53 the throne 3678 of David 1732 over Israel 3478 and over Judah, 3063 from Dan 1835 even to Beersheba. 884

3:11 And he could 3201-1 not answer 7725-53 Abner 74 a word 1697 again, because he feared 3372-2 him.

3:12 And Abner 74 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 to David 1732 on his behalf, saying, 559-2 Whose [is] the land? 776 saying 559-2 [also], Make 3772-3 thy league 1285 with me, and, behold, my hand 3027 [shall be] with thee, to bring about 5437-53 all Israel 3478 unto thee.

3:13 And he said, 559-4 Well; 2896 I will make 3772-4 a league 1285 with thee: but one 259 thing 1697 I require 7592-6 of thee, that is, 559-2 Thou shalt not see 7200-4 my face, 6440 except thou first 6440 bring 935-53 Michal 4324 Saul's 7586 daughter, 1323 when thou comest 935-2 to see 7200-2 my face. 6440

3:14 And David 1732 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 to Ishbosheth 378 Saul's 7586 son, 1121 saying, 559-2 Deliver 5414-3 [me] my wife 802 Michal, 4324 which I espoused 781-14 to me for an hundred 3967 foreskins 6190 of the Philistines. 6430

3:15 And Ishbosheth 378 sent, 7971-4 and took 3947-4 her from [her] husband, 376 [even] from Phaltiel 6409 the son 1121 of Laish. 3889|3919-k

3:16 And her husband 376 went 3212-4 with her along 1980-2 weeping 1058-2 behind 310 her to Bahurim. 980 Then said 559-4 Abner 74 unto him, Go, 3212-3 return. 7725-3 And he returned. 7725-4

3:17 And Abner 74 had 1961-1 communication 1697 with the elders 2205 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 Ye sought 1245-18 for David 1732 in times past 8543 8032 [to be] king 4428 over you:

3:18 Now then do 6213-3 [it]: for the LORD 3068 hath spoken 559-1 of David, 1732 saying, 559-2 By the hand 3027 of my servant 5650 David 1732 I will save 3467-53 my people 5971 Israel 3478 out of the hand 3027 of the Philistines, 6430 and out of the hand 3027 of all their enemies. 341-6

3:19 And Abner 74 also spake 1696-17 in the ears 241 of Benjamin: 1144 and Abner 74 went 3212-4 also to speak 1696-15 in the ears 241 of David 1732 in Hebron 2275 all that seemed 5869 good 2896 to Israel, 3478 and that seemed 5869 good to the whole house 1004 of Benjamin. 1144

3:20 So Abner 74 came 935-4 to David 1732 to Hebron, 2275 and twenty 6242 men 582 with him. And David 1732 made 6213-4 Abner 74 and the men 582 that [were] with him a feast. 4960

3:21 And Abner 74 said 559-4 unto David, 1732 I will arise 6965-4 and go, 3212-4 and will gather 6908-4 all Israel 3478 unto my lord 113 the king, 4428 that they may make 3772-4 a league 1285 with thee, and that thou mayest reign 4427-1 over all that thine heart 5315 desireth. 183-17 And David 1732 sent Abner 74 away; 7971-17 and he went 3212-4 in peace. 7965

3:22 And, behold, the servants 5650 of David 1732 and Joab 3097 came 935-6 from [pursuing] a troop, 1416 and brought in 935-52 a great 7227 spoil 7998 with them: but Abner 74 [was] not with David 1732 in Hebron; 2275 for he had sent him away, 7971-14 and he was gone 3212-4 in peace. 7965

3:23 When Joab 3097 and all the host 6635 that [was] with him were come, 935-1 they told 5046-55 Joab, 3097 saying, 559-2 Abner 74 the son 1121 of Ner 5369 came 935-1 to the king, 4428 and he hath sent him away, 7971-17 and he is gone 3212-4 in peace. 7965

3:24 Then Joab 3097 came 935-4 to the king, 4428 and said, 559-4 What hast thou done? 6213-1 behold, Abner 74 came 935-6 unto thee; why [is] it [that] thou hast sent him away, 7971-14 and he is quite 1980-2 gone? 3212-4

3:25 Thou knowest 3045-1 Abner 74 the son 1121 of Ner, 5369 that he came 935-1 to deceive 6601-15 thee, and to know 3045-2 thy going out 4161 and thy coming in, 4126|3996-k and to know 3045-2 all that thou doest. 6213-6

3:26 And when Joab 3097 was come out 3318-4 from David, 1732 he sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 after 310 Abner, 74 which brought him again 7725-55 from the well 953 of Sirah: 5626 but David 1732 knew 3045-1 [it] not.

3:27 And when Abner 74 was returned 7725-4 to Hebron, 2275 Joab 3097 took him aside 5186-55 in 413 8432 the gate 8179 to speak 1696-15 with him quietly, 7987 and smote 5221-55 him there under the fifth 2570 [rib], that he died, 4191-4 for the blood 1818 of Asahel 6214 his brother. 251

3:28 And afterward 310 when David 1732 heard 8085-4 [it], he said, 559-4 I and my kingdom 4467 [are] guiltless 5355 before the LORD 3068 for 5704 ever 5769 from the blood 1818 of Abner 74 the son 1121 of Ner: 5369

3:29 Let it rest 2342-4 on the head 7218 of Joab, 3097 and on all his father's 1 house; 1004 and let there not fail 3772-11 from the house 1004 of Joab 3097 one that hath an issue, 2100-6 or that is a leper, 6879-30 or that leaneth 2388-56 on a staff, 6418 or that falleth 5307-6 on the sword, 2719 or that lacketh 2638 bread. 3899

3:30 So Joab 3097 and Abishai 52 his brother 251 slew 2026-1 Abner, 74 because he had slain 4191-52 their brother 251 Asahel 6214 at Gibeon 1391 in the battle. 4421

3:31 And David 1732 said 559-4 to Joab, 3097 and to all the people 5971 that [were] with him, Rend 7167-3 your clothes, 899 and gird 2296-3 you with sackcloth, 8242 and mourn 5594-3 before 6440 Abner. 74 And king 4428 David 1732 [himself] followed 1980-6 310 the bier. 4296

3:32 And they buried 6912-4 Abner 74 in Hebron: 2275 and the king 4428 lifted up 5375-4 his voice, 6963 and wept 1058-4 at the grave 6913 of Abner; 74 and all the people 5971 wept. 1058-4

3:33 And the king 4428 lamented 6969-34 over Abner, 74 and said, 559-4 Died 4191-4 Abner 74 as a fool 5036 dieth? 4194

3:34 Thy hands 3027 [were] not bound, 631-7 nor thy feet 7272 put 5066-90 into fetters: 5178 as a man falleth 5307-2 before 6440 wicked 5766 men, 1121 [so] fellest 5307-1 thou. And all the people 5971 wept 1058-2 again 3254-55 over him.

3:35 And when all 3605 the people 5971 came 935-4 to cause David 1732 to eat 1262-53 meat 3899 while it was yet 5750 day, 3117 David 1732 sware, 7650-11 saying, 559-2 So do 6213-4 God 430 to me, and more 3254-55 also, if I taste 2938-4 bread, 3899 or ought 3972 else, 3605 till 6440 the sun 8121 be down. 935-2

3:36 And all 3605 the people 5971 took notice 5234-52 [of it], and it pleased 3190-4 5869 them: as whatsoever the king 4428 did 6213-1 pleased 5869 2896 all 3605 the people. 5971

3:37 For all 3605 the people 5971 and all 3605 Israel 3478 understood 3045-4 that day 3117 that it was not of the king 4428 to slay 4191-53 Abner 74 the son 1121 of Ner. 5369

3:38 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto his servants, 5650 Know 3045-4 ye not that there is a prince 8269 and a great man 1419 fallen 5307-1 this day 3117 in Israel? 3478

3:39 And I [am] this day 3117 weak, 7390 though anointed 4886-7 king; 4428 and these men 582 the sons 1121 of Zeruiah 6870 [be] too hard 7186 for me: the LORD 3068 shall reward 7999-17 the doer 6213-6 of evil according to his wickedness. 7451

4:1 And when Saul's 7586 son 1121 heard 8085-4 that Abner 74 was dead 4191-1 in Hebron, 2275 his hands 3027 were feeble, 7503-4 and all the Israelites 3478 were troubled. 926-8

4:2 And Saul's 7586 son 1121 had 1961-1 two 8147 men 582 [that were] captains 8269 of bands: 1416 the name 8034 of the one 259 [was] Baanah, 1196 and the name 8034 of the other 8145 Rechab, 7394 the sons 1121 of Rimmon 7417 a Beerothite, 886 of the children 1121 of Benjamin: 1144 (for Beeroth 881 also was reckoned 2803-11 to Benjamin: 1144

4:3 And the Beerothites 886 fled 1272-4 to Gittaim, 1664 and were sojourners 1481-6 there until this day.) 3117

4:4 And Jonathan, 3083 Saul's 7586 son, 1121 had a son 1121 [that was] lame 5223 of [his] feet. 7272 He was five 2568 years 8141 old 1121 when the tidings 8052 came 935-2 of Saul 7586 and Jonathan 3083 out of Jezreel, 3157 and his nurse 539-6 took him up, 5375-4 and fled: 5127-4 and it came to pass, as she made haste 2648-2 to flee, 5127-2 that he fell, 5307-4 and became lame. 6452-11 And his name 8034 [was] Mephibosheth. 4648

4:5 And the sons 1121 of Rimmon 7417 the Beerothite, 886 Rechab 7394 and Baanah, 1196 went, 3212-4 and came 935-4 about the heat 2527 of the day 3117 to the house 1004 of Ishbosheth, 378 who lay 7901-6 on a bed 4904 at noon. 6672

4:6 And they came 935-1 thither into the midst 8432 of the house, 1004 [as though] they would have fetched 3947-6 wheat; 2406 and they smote 5221-55 him under the fifth 2570 [rib]: and Rechab 7394 and Baanah 1196 his brother 251 escaped. 4422-8

4:7 For when they came 935-4 into the house, 1004 he lay 7901-6 on his bed 4296 in his bedchamber, 2315 4904 and they smote 5221-55 him, and slew 4191-55 him, and beheaded 5493-55 7218 him, and took 3947-4 his head, 7218 and gat them away 3212-4 through 1870 the plain 6160 all night. 3915

4:8 And they brought 935-55 the head 7218 of Ishbosheth 378 unto David 1732 to Hebron, 2275 and said 559-4 to the king, 4428 Behold the head 7218 of Ishbosheth 378 the son 1121 of Saul 7586 thine enemy, 341-6 which sought 1245-14 thy life; 5315 and the LORD 3068 hath 5414-4 avenged 5360 my lord 113 the king 4428 this day 3117 of Saul, 7586 and of his seed. 2233

4:9 And David 1732 answered 6030-4 Rechab 7394 and Baanah 1196 his brother, 251 the sons 1121 of Rimmon 7417 the Beerothite, 886 and said 559-4 unto them, [As] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 who hath redeemed 6299-1 my soul 5315 out of all adversity, 6869

4:10 When one told 5046-56 me, saying, 559-2 Behold, Saul 7586 is dead, 4191-1 thinking to have brought 5869 good tidings, 1319-18 I took hold 270-4 of him, and slew 2026-4 him in Ziklag, 6860 who [thought] that I would have given 5414-2 him a reward for his tidings: 1309

4:11 How much more, when wicked 7563 men 582 have slain 2026-1 a righteous 6662 person 376 in his own house 1004 upon his bed? 4904 shall I not therefore now require 1245-17 his blood 1818 of your hand, 3027 and take you away 1197-14 from the earth? 776

4:12 And David 1732 commanded 6680-17 his young men, 5288 and they slew 2026-4 them, and cut off 7112-17 their hands 3027 and their feet, 7272 and hanged 8518-4 [them] up over the pool 1295 in Hebron. 2275 But they took 3947-1 the head 7218 of Ishbosheth, 378 and buried 6912-4 [it] in the sepulchre 6913 of Abner 74 in Hebron. 2275

5:1 Then came 935-4 all the tribes 7626 of Israel 3478 to David 1732 unto Hebron, 2275 and spake, 559-4 saying, 559-2 Behold, we [are] thy bone 6106 and thy flesh. 1320

5:2 Also in time past, 865 8032 when Saul 7586 was king 4428 over us, thou wast he that leddest out 3318-56 and broughtest in 935-56 Israel: 3478 and the LORD 3068 said 559-4 to thee, Thou shalt feed 7462-4 my people 5971 Israel, 3478 and thou shalt be a captain 5057 over Israel. 3478

5:3 So all the elders 2205 of Israel 3478 came 935-4 to the king 4428 to Hebron; 2275 and king 4428 David 1732 made 3772-4 a league 1285 with them in Hebron 2275 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 and they anointed 4886-4 David 1732 king 4428 over Israel. 3478

5:4 David 1732 [was] thirty 7970 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 [and] he reigned 4427-1 forty 705 years. 8141

5:5 In Hebron 2275 he reigned 4427-1 over Judah 3063 seven 7651 years 8141 and six 8337 months: 2320 and in Jerusalem 3389 he reigned 4427-1 thirty 7970 and three 7969 years 8141 over all Israel 3478 and Judah. 3063

5:6 And the king 4428 and his men 582 went 3212-4 to Jerusalem 3389 unto the Jebusites, 2983 the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land: 776 which spake 559-4 unto David, 1732 saying, 559-2 Except thou take away 5493-53 the blind 5787 and the lame, 6455 thou shalt not come in 935-4 hither: thinking, 559-2 David 1732 cannot come in 935-4 hither.

5:7 Nevertheless David 1732 took 3920-4 the strong hold 4686 of Zion: 6726 the same [is] the city 5892 of David. 1732

5:8 And David 1732 said 559-4 on that day, 3117 Whosoever getteth up 5060-4 to the gutter, 6794 and smiteth 5221-56 the Jebusites, 2983 and the lame 6455 and the blind, 5787 [that are] hated 8130-7 of David's 1732 soul, 5315 [he shall be chief and captain]. Wherefore they said, 559-4 The blind 5787 and the lame 6455 shall not come 935-4 into the house. 1004

5:9 So David 1732 dwelt 3427-4 in the fort, 4686 and called 7121-4 it the city 5892 of David. 1732 And David 1732 built 1129-4 round about 5439 from Millo 4407 and inward. 1004

5:10 And David 1732 went 3212-4 on, 1980-2 and grew great, 1419 and the LORD 3068 God 430 of hosts 6635 [was] with him.

5:11 And Hiram 2438 king 4428 of Tyre 6865 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 to David, 1732 and cedar 730 trees, 6086 and carpenters, 2796 6086 and masons: 2796 7023 68 and they built 1129-4 David 1732 an house. 1004

5:12 And David 1732 perceived 3045-4 that the LORD 3068 had established 3559-52 him king 4428 over Israel, 3478 and that he had exalted 5375-14 his kingdom 4467 for his people 5971 Israel's 3478 sake.

5:13 And David 1732 took 3947-4 [him] more concubines 6370 and wives 802 out of Jerusalem, 3389 after 310 he was come 935-2 from Hebron: 2275 and there were yet sons 1121 and daughters 1323 born 3205-11 to David. 1732

5:14 And these [be] the names 8034 of those that were born 3209 unto him in Jerusalem; 3389 Shammua, 8051 and Shobab, 7727 and Nathan, 5416 and Solomon, 8010

5:15 Ibhar 2984 also, and Elishua, 474 and Nepheg, 5298 and Japhia, 3309

5:16 And Elishama, 476 and Eliada, 450 and Eliphalet. 467

5:17 But when the Philistines 6430 heard 8085-4 that they had anointed 4886-1 David 1732 king 4428 over Israel, 3478 all the Philistines 6430 came up 5927-4 to seek 1245-15 David; 1732 and David 1732 heard 8085-4 [of it], and went down 3381-4 to the hold. 4686

5:18 The Philistines 6430 also came 935-1 and spread 5203-11 themselves in the valley 6010 of Rephaim. 7497

5:19 And David 1732 enquired 7592-4 of the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 Shall I go up 5927-4 to the Philistines? 6430 wilt thou deliver 5414-4 them into mine hand? 3027 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto David, 1732 Go up: 5927-3 for I will doubtless 5414-2 deliver 5414-4 the Philistines 6430 into thine hand. 3027

5:20 And David 1732 came 935-4 to Baalperazim, 1188 and David 1732 smote 5221-55 them there, and said, 559-4 The LORD 3068 hath broken forth 6555-1 upon mine enemies 341-6 before 6440 me, as the breach 6556 of waters. 4325 Therefore he called 7121-1 the name 8034 of that place 4725 Baalperazim. 1188

5:21 And there they left 5800-4 their images, 6091 and David 1732 and his men 582 burned 5375-4 them.

5:22 And the Philistines 6430 came up 5927-2 yet again, 3254-55 and spread 5203-11 themselves in the valley 6010 of Rephaim. 7497

5:23 And when David 1732 enquired 7592-4 of the LORD, 3068 he said, 559-4 Thou shalt not go up; 5927-4 [but] fetch a compass 5437-54 behind 310 them, and come 935-1 upon them over against 4136 the mulberry trees. 1057

5:24 And let it be, when thou hearest 8085-2 the sound 6963 of a going 6807 in the tops 7218 of the mulberry trees, 1057 that then thou shalt bestir 2782-4 thyself: for then shall the LORD 3068 go out 3318-1 before 6440 thee, to smite 5221-53 the host 4264 of the Philistines. 6430

5:25 And David 1732 did 6213-4 so, as the LORD 3068 had commanded 6680-14 him; and smote 5221-55 the Philistines 6430 from Geba 1387 until thou come 935-2 to Gazer. 1507

6:1 Again, David 1732 gathered 622-4|3254-55 together all [the] chosen 977-7 [men] of Israel, 3478 thirty 7970 thousand. 505

6:2 And David 1732 arose, 6965-4 and went 3212-4 with all the people 5971 that [were] with him from Baale of Judah, 1167|3063|1184 to bring up 5927-53 from thence the ark 727 of God, 430 whose name 8034 is called 7121-8 by the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 that dwelleth 3427-6 [between] the cherubims. 3742

6:3 And they set 7392-55 the ark 727 of God 430 upon a new 2319 cart, 5699 and brought 5375-4 it out of the house 1004 of Abinadab 41 that [was] in Gibeah: 1390 and Uzzah 5798 and Ahio, 283 the sons 1121 of Abinadab, 41 drave 5090-6 the new 2319 cart. 5699

6:4 And they brought 5375-4 it out of the house 1004 of Abinadab 41 which [was] at Gibeah, 1390 accompanying 5973 the ark 727 of God: 430 and Ahio 283 went 1980-6 before 6440 the ark. 727

6:5 And David 1732 and all the house 1004 of Israel 3478 played 7832-18 before 6440 the LORD 3068 on all manner of [instruments made of] fir 1265 wood, 6086 even on harps, 3658 and on psalteries, 5035 and on timbrels, 8596 and on cornets, 4517 and on cymbals. 6767

6:6 And when they came 935-4 to Nachon's 5225 threshingfloor, 1637 Uzzah 5798 put forth 7971-4 [his hand] to the ark 727 of God, 430 and took hold 270-4 of it; for the oxen 1241 shook 8058-1 [it].

6:7 And the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 was kindled 2734-4 against Uzzah; 5798 and God 430 smote 5221-55 him there for [his] error; 7944 and there he died 4191-4 by the ark 727 of God. 430

6:8 And David 1732 was displeased, 2734-4 because the LORD 3068 had made 6555-1 a breach 6556 upon Uzzah: 5798 and he called 7121-4 the name of the place 4725 Perezuzzah 6560 to this day. 3117

6:9 And David 1732 was afraid 3372-4 of the LORD 3068 that day, 3117 and said, 559-4 How shall the ark 727 of the LORD 3068 come 935-4 to me?

6:10 So David 1732 would 14-1 not remove 5493-53 the ark 727 of the LORD 3068 unto him into the city 5892 of David: 1732 but David 1732 carried it aside 5186-55 into the house 1004 of Obededom 5654 the Gittite. 1663

6:11 And the ark 727 of the LORD 3068 continued 3427-4 in the house 1004 of Obededom 5654 the Gittite 1663 three 7969 months: 2320 and the LORD 3068 blessed 1288-17 Obededom, 5654 and all his household. 1004

6:12 And it was told 5046-93 king 4428 David, 1732 saying, 559-2 The LORD 3068 hath blessed 1288-14 the house 1004 of Obededom, 5654 and all that [pertaineth] unto him, because of the ark 727 of God. 430 So David 1732 went 3212-4 and brought up 5927-55 the ark 727 of God 430 from the house 1004 of Obededom 5654 into the city 5892 of David 1732 with gladness. 8057

6:13 And it was [so], that when they that bare 5375-6 the ark 727 of the LORD 3068 had gone 6805-1 six 8337 paces, 6806 he sacrificed 2076-4 oxen 7794 and fatlings. 4806

6:14 And David 1732 danced 3769-47 before 6440 the LORD 3068 with all [his] might; 5797 and David 1732 [was] girded 2296-7 with a linen 906 ephod. 646

6:15 So David 1732 and all the house 1004 of Israel 3478 brought up 5927-56 the ark 727 of the LORD 3068 with shouting, 8643 and with the sound 6963 of the trumpet. 7782

6:16 And as the ark 727 of the LORD 3068 came 935-6 into the city 5892 of David, 1732 Michal 4324 Saul's 7586 daughter 1323 looked 8259-8 through a window, 2474 and saw 7200-4 king 4428 David 1732 leaping 6339-18 and dancing 3769-47 before 6440 the LORD; 3068 and she despised 959-4 him in her heart. 3820

6:17 And they brought 935-55 in the ark 727 of the LORD, 3068 and set 3322-55 it in his place, 4725 in the midst 8432 of the tabernacle 168 that David 1732 had pitched 5186-1 for it: and David 1732 offered 5927-55 burnt offerings 5930 and peace offerings 8002 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

6:18 And as soon as David 1732 had made an end 3615-17 of offering 5927-53 burnt offerings 5930 and peace offerings, 8002 he blessed 1288-17 the people 5971 in the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 of hosts. 6635

6:19 And he dealt 2505-17 among all the people, 5971 [even] among the whole multitude 1995 of Israel, 3478 as well to the women 802 as men, 376 to every one 376 a 259 cake 2471 of bread, 3899 and a 259 good piece 829 [of flesh], and a 259 flagon 809 [of wine]. So all the people 5971 departed 3212-4 every one 376 to his house. 1004

6:20 Then David 1732 returned 7725-4 to bless 1288-15 his household. 1004 And Michal 4324 the daughter 1323 of Saul 7586 came out 3318-4 to meet 7125-2 David, 1732 and said, 559-4 How glorious 3513-8 was the king 4428 of Israel 3478 to day, 3117 who uncovered 1540-8 himself to day 3117 in the eyes 5869 of the handmaids 519 of his servants, 5650 as one 259 of the vain 7386 fellows shamelessly 1540-9 uncovereth 1540-9 himself!

6:21 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto Michal, 4324 [It was] before 6440 the LORD, 3068 which chose 977-1 me before thy father, 1 and before all his house, 1004 to appoint 6680-15 me ruler 5057 over the people 5971 of the LORD, 3068 over Israel: 3478 therefore will I play 7832-14 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

6:22 And I will yet be more vile 7043-8 than thus, 2063 and will be base 8217 in mine own sight: 5869 and of the maidservants 519 which thou hast spoken 559-1 of, of them shall I be had in honour. 3513-11

6:23 Therefore Michal 4324 the daughter 1323 of Saul 7586 had no child 2056|3206-k unto the day 3117 of her death. 4194

7:1 And it came to pass, when the king 4428 sat 3427-1 in his house, 1004 and the LORD 3068 had given him rest 5117-52 round about 5439 from all his enemies; 341-6

7:2 That the king 4428 said 559-4 unto Nathan 5416 the prophet, 5030 See 7200-3 now, I dwell 3427-6 in an house 1004 of cedar, 730 but the ark 727 of God 430 dwelleth 3427-6 within 8432 curtains. 3407

7:3 And Nathan 5416 said 559-4 to the king, 4428 Go, 3212-3 do 6213-3 all that [is] in thine heart; 3824 for the LORD 3068 [is] with thee.

7:4 And it came to pass that night, 3915 that the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto Nathan, 5416 saying, 559-2

7:5 Go 3212-3 and tell 559-1 my servant 5650 David, 1732 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Shalt thou build 1129-4 me an house 1004 for me to dwell in? 3427-2

7:6 Whereas I have not dwelt 3427-1 in [any] house 1004 since the time 3117 that I brought up 5927-53 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 out of Egypt, 4714 even to this day, 3117 but have walked 1980-102 in a tent 168 and in a tabernacle. 4908

7:7 In all [the places] wherein I have walked 1980-98 with all the children 1121 of Israel 3478 spake 1696-14 I a word 1697 with any 259 of the tribes 7626 of Israel, 3478 whom I commanded 6680-14 to feed 7462-2 my people 5971 Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 Why build 1129-1 ye not me an house 1004 of cedar? 730

7:8 Now therefore so shalt thou say 559-4 unto my servant 5650 David, 1732 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 I took 3947-1 thee from the sheepcote, 5116 from following 310 the sheep, 6629 to be ruler 5057 over my people, 5971 over Israel: 3478

7:9 And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, 1980-1 and have cut off 3772-55 all thine enemies 341-6 out of thy sight, 6440 and have made 6213-1 thee a great 1419 name, 8034 like unto the name 8034 of the great 1419 [men] that [are] in the earth. 776

7:10 Moreover I will appoint 7760-1 a place 4725 for my people 5971 Israel, 3478 and will plant 5193-1 them, that they may dwell 7931-1 in a place of their own, and move 7264-4 no more; neither shall the children 1121 of wickedness 5766 afflict 6031-15 them any more, 3254-55 as beforetime, 7223

7:11 And as since the time 3117 that I commanded 6680-14 judges 8199-6 [to be] over my people 5971 Israel, 3478 and have caused thee to rest 5117-52 from all thine enemies. 341-6 Also the LORD 3068 telleth 5046-52 thee that he 3068 will make 6213-4 thee an house. 1004

7:12 And when thy days 3117 be fulfilled, 4390-4 and thou shalt sleep 7901-1 with thy fathers, 1 I will set up 6965-52 thy seed 2233 after 310 thee, which shall proceed 3318-4 out of thy bowels, 4578 and I will establish 3559-52 his kingdom. 4467

7:13 He shall build 1129-4 an house 1004 for my name, 8034 and I will stablish 3559-31 the throne 3678 of his kingdom 4467 for 5704 ever. 5769

7:14 I will be his father, 1 and he shall be my son. 1121 If he commit iniquity, 5753-53 I will chasten 3198-52 him with the rod 7626 of men, 582 and with the stripes 5061 of the children 1121 of men: 120

7:15 But my mercy 2617 shall not depart away 5493-4 from him, as I took 5493-52 [it] from Saul, 7586 whom I put away 5493-52 before 6440 thee.

7:16 And thine house 1004 and thy kingdom 4467 shall be established 539-8 for 5704 ever 5769 before 6440 thee: thy throne 3678 shall be established 3559-12 for 5704 ever. 5769

7:17 According to all these words, 1697 and according to all this vision, 2384 so did Nathan 5416 speak 1696-14 unto David. 1732

7:18 Then went 935-4 king 4428 David 1732 in, and sat 3427-4 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and he said, 559-4 Who [am] I, O Lord 136 GOD? 3069 and what [is] my house, 1004 that thou hast brought 935-52 me hitherto? 1988

7:19 And this was yet a small thing 6994-4 in thy sight, 5869 O Lord 136 GOD; 3069 but thou hast spoken 1696-17 also of thy servant's 5650 house 1004 for a great while to come. 7350 And [is] this the manner 8452 of man, 120 O Lord 136 GOD? 3069

7:20 And what can David 1732 say 1696-15 more 3254-55 unto thee? for thou, Lord 136 GOD, 3069 knowest 3045-1 thy servant. 5650

7:21 For thy word's 1697 sake, and according to thine own heart, 3820 hast thou done 6213-1 all these great things, 1420 to make thy servant 5650 know 3045-53 [them].

7:22 Wherefore thou art great, 1431-1 O LORD 3068 God: 430 for [there is] none like thee, neither [is there any] God 430 beside 2108 thee, according to all that we have heard 8085-1 with our ears. 241

7:23 And what one 259 nation 1471 in the earth 776 [is] like thy people, 5971 [even] like Israel, 3478 whom God 430 went 1980-1 to redeem 6299-2 for a people 5971 to himself, and to make 7760-2 him a name, 8034 and to do 6213-2 for you great things 1420 and terrible, 3372-12 for thy land, 776 before 6440 thy people, 5971 which thou redeemedst 6299-1 to thee from Egypt, 4714 [from] the nations 1471 and their gods? 430

7:24 For thou hast confirmed 3559-34 to thyself thy people 5971 Israel 3478 [to be] a people 5971 unto thee for 5704 ever: 5769 and thou, LORD, 3068 art become 1961-1 their God. 430

7:25 And now, O LORD 3068 God, 430 the word 1697 that thou hast spoken 1696-14 concerning thy servant, 5650 and concerning his house, 1004 establish 6965-54 [it] for 5704 ever, 5769 and do 6213-3 as thou hast said. 1696-14

7:26 And let thy name 8034 be magnified 1431-4 for 5704 ever, 5769 saying, 559-2 The LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 [is] the God 430 over Israel: 3478 and let the house 1004 of thy servant 5650 David 1732 be established 3559-12 before 6440 thee.

7:27 For thou, O LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 God 430 of Israel, 3478 hast revealed 1540-1 241 to thy servant, 5650 saying, 559-2 I will build 1129-4 thee an house: 1004 therefore hath thy servant 5650 found 4672-1 in his heart 3820 to pray 6419-99 this prayer 8605 unto thee.

7:28 And now, O Lord 136 GOD, 3069 thou [art] that God, 430 and thy words 1697 be true, 571 and thou hast promised 1696-17 this goodness 2896 unto thy servant: 5650

7:29 Therefore now let it please 2974-54 thee to bless 1288-16 the house 1004 of thy servant, 5650 that it may continue for ever 5769 before 6440 thee: for thou, O Lord 136 GOD, 3069 hast spoken 1696-14 [it]: and with thy blessing 1293 let the house 1004 of thy servant 5650 be blessed 1288-29 for ever. 5769

8:1 And after 310 this it came to pass, that David 1732 smote 5221-55 the Philistines, 6430 and subdued 3665-55 them: and David 1732 took 3947-4 Methegammah 4964|522|4965 out of the hand 3027 of the Philistines. 6430

8:2 And he smote 5221-55 Moab, 4124 and measured 4058-17 them with a line, 2256 casting them down 7901-53 to the ground; 776 even with two 8147 lines 2256 measured 4058-17 he to put to death, 4191-53 and with one full 4393 line 2256 to keep alive. 2421-53 And [so] the Moabites 4124 became David's 1732 servants, 5650 [and] brought 5375-6 gifts. 4503

8:3 David 1732 smote 5221-55 also Hadadezer, 1909 the son 1121 of Rehob, 7340 king 4428 of Zobah, 6678 as he went 3212-2 to recover 7725-53 his border 3027 at the river 5104 Euphrates. 6578

8:4 And David 1732 took 3920-4 from him a thousand 505 [chariots], and seven 7651 hundred 3967 horsemen, 6571 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 footmen: 376 7273 and David 1732 houghed 6131-17 all the chariot 7393 [horses], but reserved 3498-55 of them [for] an hundred 3967 chariots. 7393

8:5 And when the Syrians 758 of Damascus 1834 came 935-4 to succour 5826-2 Hadadezer 1909 king 4428 of Zobah, 6678 David 1732 slew 5221-55 of the Syrians 758 two 8147 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 men. 376

8:6 Then David 1732 put 7760-4 garrisons 5333 in Syria 758 of Damascus: 1834 and the Syrians 758 became servants 5650 to David, 1732 [and] brought 5375-6 gifts. 4503 And the LORD 3068 preserved 3467-55 David 1732 whithersoever he went. 1980-1

8:7 And David 1732 took 3947-4 the shields 7982 of gold 2091 that were on the servants 5650 of Hadadezer, 1909 and brought 935-55 them to Jerusalem. 3389

8:8 And from Betah, 984 and from Berothai, 1268 cities 5892 of Hadadezer, 1909 king 4428 David 1732 took 3947-1 exceeding 3966 much 7235-53 brass. 5178

8:9 When Toi 8583 king 4428 of Hamath 2574 heard 8085-4 that David 1732 had smitten 5221-52 all the host 2428 of Hadadezer, 1909

8:10 Then Toi 8583 sent 7971-4 Joram 3141 his son 1121 unto king 4428 David, 1732 to salute 7592-2 7965 him, and to bless 1288-15 him, because he had fought 3898-8 against Hadadezer, 1909 and smitten 5221-55 him: for Hadadezer 1909 had wars 376 4421 with Toi. 8583 And [Joram] brought with him 3027 vessels 3627 of silver, 3701 and vessels 3627 of gold, 2091 and vessels 3627 of brass: 5178

8:11 Which also king 4428 David 1732 did dedicate 6942-52 unto the LORD, 3068 with the silver 3701 and gold 2091 that he had dedicated 6942-52 of all nations 1471 which he subdued; 3533-14

8:12 Of Syria, 758 and of Moab, 4124 and of the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 and of the Philistines, 6430 and of Amalek, 6002 and of the spoil 7998 of Hadadezer, 1909 son 1121 of Rehob, 7340 king 4428 of Zobah. 6678

8:13 And David 1732 gat 6213-4 [him] a name 8034 when he returned 7725-2 from smiting 5221-53 of the Syrians 758 in the valley 1516 of salt, 4417 [being] eighteen 8083 6240 thousand 505 [men].

8:14 And he put 7760-4 garrisons 5333 in Edom; 123 throughout all Edom 123 put 7760-1 he garrisons, 5333 and all they of Edom 123 became David's 1732 servants. 5650 And the LORD 3068 preserved 3467-55 David 1732 whithersoever he went. 1980-1

8:15 And David 1732 reigned 4427-4 over all Israel; 3478 and David 1732 executed 6213-6 judgment 4941 and justice 6666 unto all his people. 5971

8:16 And Joab 3097 the son 1121 of Zeruiah 6870 [was] over the host; 6635 and Jehoshaphat 3092 the son 1121 of Ahilud 286 [was] recorder; 2142-56

8:17 And Zadok 6659 the son 1121 of Ahitub, 285 and Ahimelech 288 the son 1121 of Abiathar, 54 [were] the priests; 3548 and Seraiah 8304 [was] the scribe; 5608-6

8:18 And Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada 3077 [was over] both the Cherethites 3774 and the Pelethites; 6432 and David's 1732 sons 1121 were chief rulers. 3548

9:1 And David 1732 said, 559-4 Is there 3426 yet any that is left 3498-8 of the house 1004 of Saul, 7586 that I may shew 6213-4 him kindness 2617 for Jonathan's 3083 sake?

9:2 And [there was] of the house 1004 of Saul 7586 a servant 5650 whose name 8034 [was] Ziba. 6717 And when they had called 7121-4 him unto David, 1732 the king 4428 said 559-4 unto him, [Art] thou Ziba? 6717 And he said, 559-4 Thy servant 5650 [is he].

9:3 And the king 4428 said, 559-4 [Is] there not 657 yet any 376 of the house 1004 of Saul, 7586 that I may shew 6213-4 the kindness 2617 of God 430 unto him? And Ziba 6717 said 559-4 unto the king, 4428 Jonathan 3083 hath yet a son, 1121 [which is] lame 5223 on [his] feet. 7272

9:4 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto him, Where 375 [is] he? And Ziba 6717 said 559-4 unto the king, 4428 Behold, he [is] in the house 1004 of Machir, 4353 the son 1121 of Ammiel, 5988 in Lodebar. 3810

9:5 Then king 4428 David 1732 sent, 7971-4 and fetched 3947-4 him out of the house 1004 of Machir, 4353 the son 1121 of Ammiel, 5988 from Lodebar. 3810

9:6 Now when Mephibosheth, 4648 the son 1121 of Jonathan, 3083 the son 1121 of Saul, 7586 was come 935-4 unto David, 1732 he fell 5307-4 on his face, 6440 and did reverence. 7812-101 And David 1732 said, 559-4 Mephibosheth. 4648 And he answered, 559-4 Behold thy servant! 5650

9:7 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto him, Fear 3372-4 not: for I will surely 6213-2 shew 6213-4 thee kindness 2617 for Jonathan 3083 thy father's 1 sake, and will restore 7725-52 thee all the land 7704 of Saul 7586 thy father; 1 and thou shalt eat 398-4 bread 3899 at my table 7979 continually. 8548

9:8 And he bowed 7812-101 himself, and said, 559-4 What [is] thy servant, 5650 that thou shouldest look 6437-1 upon such a dead 4191-5 dog 3611 as I [am]?

9:9 Then the king 4428 called 7121-4 to Ziba, 6717 Saul's 7586 servant, 5288 and said 559-4 unto him, I have given 5414-1 unto thy master's 113 son 1121 all that pertained 1961-1 to Saul 7586 and to all his house. 1004

9:10 Thou therefore, and thy sons, 1121 and thy servants, 5650 shall till 5647-1 the land 127 for him, and thou shalt bring in 935-52 [the fruits], that thy master's 113 son 1121 may have food 3899 to eat: 398-1 but Mephibosheth 4648 thy master's 113 son 1121 shall eat 398-4 bread 3899 alway 8548 at my table. 7979 Now Ziba 6717 had fifteen 2568 6240 sons 1121 and twenty 6242 servants. 5650

9:11 Then said 559-4 Ziba 6717 unto the king, 4428 According to all that my lord 113 the king 4428 hath commanded 6680-17 his servant, 5650 so shall thy servant 5650 do. 6213-4 As for Mephibosheth, 4648 [said the king], he shall eat 398-6 at my table, 7979 as one 259 of the king's 4428 sons. 1121

9:12 And Mephibosheth 4648 had a young 6996 son, 1121 whose name 8034 [was] Micha. 4316 And all that dwelt 4186 in the house 1004 of Ziba 6717 [were] servants 5650 unto Mephibosheth. 4648

9:13 So Mephibosheth 4648 dwelt 3427-6 in Jerusalem: 3389 for he did eat 398-6 continually 8548 at the king's 4428 table; 7979 and was lame 6455 on both 8147 his feet. 7272

10:1 And it came to pass after 310 this, that the king 4428 of the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 died, 4191-4 and Hanun 2586 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

10:2 Then said 559-4 David, 1732 I will shew 6213-4 kindness 2617 unto Hanun 2586 the son 1121 of Nahash, 5176 as his father 1 shewed 6213-1 kindness 2617 unto me. And David 1732 sent 7971-4 to comfort 5162-15 him by the hand 3027 of his servants 5650 for his father. 1 And David's 1732 servants 5650 came 935-4 into the land 776 of the children 1121 of Ammon. 5983

10:3 And the princes 8269 of the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 said 559-4 unto Hanun 2586 their lord, 113 Thinkest 5869 thou that David 1732 doth honour 3513-18 thy father, 1 that he hath sent 7971-1 comforters 5162-18 unto thee? hath not David 1732 [rather] sent 7971-1 his servants 5650 unto thee, to 5668 search 2713-2 the city, 5892 and to spy it out, 7270-15 and to overthrow 2015-2 it?

10:4 Wherefore Hanun 2586 took 3947-4 David's 1732 servants, 5650 and shaved off 1548-17 the one half 2677 of their beards, 2206 and cut off 3772-4 their garments 4063 in the middle, 2677 [even] to their buttocks, 8357 and sent them away. 7971-17

10:5 When they told 5046-55 [it] unto David, 1732 he sent 7971-4 to meet 7125-2 them, because the men 582 were greatly 3966 ashamed: 3637-12 and the king 4428 said, 559-4 Tarry 3427-3 at Jericho 3405 until your beards 2206 be grown, 6779-17 and [then] return. 7725-1

10:6 And when the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 saw 7200-4 that they stank 887-8 before David, 1732 the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 sent 7971-4 and hired 7936-4 the Syrians 758 of Bethrehob, 1050 and the Syrians 758 of Zoba, 6678 twenty 6242 thousand 505 footmen, 7273 and of king 4428 Maacah 4601 a thousand 505 men, 376 and of Ishtob 382 twelve 6240 8147 thousand 505 men. 376

10:7 And when David 1732 heard 8085-4 of [it], he sent 7971-4 Joab, 3097 and all the host 6635 of the mighty men. 1368

10:8 And the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 came out, 3318-4 and put the battle 4421 in array 6186-4 at the entering in 6607 of the gate: 8179 and the Syrians 758 of Zoba, 6678 and of Rehob, 7340 and Ishtob, 382 and Maacah, 4601 [were] by themselves 905 in the field. 7704

10:9 When Joab 3097 saw 7200-4 that the front 6440 of the battle 4421 was against him before 6440 and behind, 268 he chose 977-4 of all the choice 977-7 [men] of Israel, 3478 and put [them] in array 6186-4 against 7125-2 the Syrians: 758

10:10 And the rest 3499 of the people 5971 he delivered 5414-1 into the hand 3027 of Abishai 52 his brother, 251 that he might put [them] in array 6186-4 against 7125-2 the children 1121 of Ammon. 5983

10:11 And he said, 559-4 If the Syrians 758 be too strong 2388-4 for me, then thou shalt help 3444 me: but if the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 be too strong 2388-4 for thee, then I will come 1980-1 and help 3467-53 thee.

10:12 Be of good courage, 2388-3 and let us play the men 2388-101 for our people, 5971 and for the cities 5892 of our God: 430 and the LORD 3068 do 6213-4 that which seemeth 5869 him good. 2896

10:13 And Joab 3097 drew nigh, 5066-4 and the people 5971 that [were] with him, unto the battle 4421 against the Syrians: 758 and they fled 5127-4 before 6440 him.

10:14 And when the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 saw 7200-1 that the Syrians 758 were fled, 5127-1 then fled 5127-4 they also before 6440 Abishai, 52 and entered 935-4 into the city. 5892 So Joab 3097 returned 7725-4 from the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 and came 935-4 to Jerusalem. 3389

10:15 And when the Syrians 758 saw 7200-4 that they were smitten 5062-8 before 6440 Israel, 3478 they gathered 622-11 themselves together. 3162

10:16 And Hadarezer 1928 sent, 7971-4 and brought out 3318-55 the Syrians 758 that [were] beyond 5676 the river: 5104 and they came 935-4 to Helam; 2431 and Shobach 7731 the captain 8269 of the host 6635 of Hadarezer 1928 [went] before 6440 them.

10:17 And when it was told 5046-93 David, 1732 he gathered 622-4 all Israel 3478 together, and passed over 5674-4 Jordan, 3383 and came 935-4 to Helam. 2431 And the Syrians 758 set themselves in array 6186-4 against 7125-2 David, 1732 and fought 3898-11 with him.

10:18 And the Syrians 758 fled 5127-4 before 6440 Israel; 3478 and David 1732 slew 2026-4 [the men of] seven 7651 hundred 3967 chariots 7393 of the Syrians, 758 and forty 705 thousand 505 horsemen, 6571 and smote 5221-52 Shobach 7731 the captain 8269 of their host, 6635 who died 4191-4 there.

10:19 And when all the kings 4428 [that were] servants 5650 to Hadarezer 1928 saw 7200-4 that they were smitten 5062-8 before 6440 Israel, 3478 they made peace 7999-55 with Israel, 3478 and served 5647-4 them. So the Syrians 758 feared 3372-4 to help 3467-53 the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 any more.

11:1 And it came to pass, after the year 8141 was expired, 8666 at the time 6256 when kings 4428|4397-k go forth 3318-2 [to battle], that David 1732 sent 7971-4 Joab, 3097 and his servants 5650 with him, and all Israel; 3478 and they destroyed 7843-55 the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 and besieged 6696-4 Rabbah. 7237 But David 1732 tarried 3427-6 still at Jerusalem. 3389

11:2 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, 6153 6256 that David 1732 arose 6965-4 from off his bed, 4904 and walked 1980-101 upon the roof 1406 of the king's 4428 house: 1004 and from the roof 1406 he saw 7200-4 a woman 802 washing 7364-5 herself; and the woman 802 [was] very 3966 beautiful 2896 to look upon. 4758

11:3 And David 1732 sent 7971-4 and enquired 1875-4 after the woman. 802 And [one] said, 559-4 [Is] not this Bathsheba, 1339 the daughter 1323 of Eliam, 463 the wife 802 of Uriah 223 the Hittite? 2850

11:4 And David 1732 sent 7971-4 messengers, 4397 and took 3947-4 her; and she came in 935-4 unto him, and he lay 7901-4 with her; for she was purified 6942-102 from her uncleanness: 2932 and she returned 7725-4 unto her house. 1004

11:5 And the woman 802 conceived, 2029-4 and sent 7971-4 and told 5046-55 David, 1732 and said, 559-4 I [am] with child. 2030

11:6 And David 1732 sent 7971-4 to Joab, 3097 [saying], Send 7971-3 me Uriah 223 the Hittite. 2850 And Joab 3097 sent 7971-4 Uriah 223 to David. 1732

11:7 And when Uriah 223 was come 935-4 unto him, David 1732 demanded 7592-4 [of him] how Joab 3097 did, 7965 and how the people 5971 did, 7965 and how the war 4421 prospered. 7965

11:8 And David 1732 said 559-4 to Uriah, 223 Go down 3381-3 to thy house, 1004 and wash 7364-3 thy feet. 7272 And Uriah 223 departed 3318-4 out of the king's 4428 house, 1004 and there followed 3318-4 310 him a mess 4864 [of meat] from the king. 4428

11:9 But Uriah 223 slept 7901-4 at the door 6607 of the king's 4428 house 1004 with all the servants 5650 of his lord, 113 and went not down 3381-1 to his house. 1004

11:10 And when they had told 5046-55 David, 1732 saying, 559-2 Uriah 223 went not down 3381-1 unto his house, 1004 David 1732 said 559-4 unto Uriah, 223 Camest 935-6 thou not from [thy] journey? 1870 why [then] didst thou not go down 3381-1 unto thine house? 1004

11:11 And Uriah 223 said 559-4 unto David, 1732 The ark, 727 and Israel, 3478 and Judah, 3063 abide 3427-6 in tents; 5521 and my lord 113 Joab, 3097 and the servants 5650 of my lord, 113 are encamped 2583-6 in the open 6440 fields; 7704 shall I 589 then go 935-4 into mine house, 1004 to eat 398-2 and to drink, 8354-2 and to lie 7901-2 with my wife? 802 [as] thou livest, 2416 and [as] thy soul 5315 liveth, 2416 I will not do 6213-4 this thing. 1697

11:12 And David 1732 said 559-4 to Uriah, 223 Tarry 3427-3 here to day 3117 also, and to morrow 4279 I will let thee depart. 7971-17 So Uriah 223 abode 3427-4 in Jerusalem 3389 that day, 3117 and the morrow. 4283

11:13 And when David 1732 had called 7121-4 him, he did eat 398-4 and drink 8354-4 before 6440 him; and he made him drunk: 7937-17 and at even 6153 he went out 3318-4 to lie 7901-2 on his bed 4904 with the servants 5650 of his lord, 113 but went not down 3381-1 to his house. 1004

11:14 And it came to pass in the morning, 1242 that David 1732 wrote 3789-4 a letter 5612 to Joab, 3097 and sent 7971-4 [it] by the hand 3027 of Uriah. 223

11:15 And he wrote 3789-4 in the letter, 5612 saying, 559-2 Set 3051-3 ye Uriah 223 in the forefront 6440 4136 of the hottest 2389 battle, 4421 and retire 7725-1 ye from 310 him, that he may be smitten, 5221-8 and die. 4191-1

11:16 And it came to pass, when Joab 3097 observed 8104-2 the city, 5892 that he assigned 5414-4 Uriah 223 unto a place 4725 where he knew 3045-1 that valiant 2428 men 582 [were].

11:17 And the men 582 of the city 5892 went out, 3318-4 and fought 3898-11 with Joab: 3097 and there fell 5307-4 [some] of the people 5971 of the servants 5650 of David; 1732 and Uriah 223 the Hittite 2850 died 4191-4 also.

11:18 Then Joab 3097 sent 7971-4 and told 5046-55 David 1732 all the things 1697 concerning the war; 4421

11:19 And charged 6680-17 the messenger, 4397 saying, 559-2 When thou hast made an end 3615-15 of telling 1696-15 the matters 1697 of the war 4421 unto the king, 4428

11:20 And if so be that the king's 4428 wrath 2534 arise, 5927-4 and he say 559-1 unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh 5066-8 unto the city 5892 when ye did fight? 3898-9 knew 3045-1 ye not that they would shoot 3384-55 from the wall? 2346

11:21 Who smote 5221-52 Abimelech 40 the son 1121 of Jerubbesheth? 3380 did not a woman 802 cast 7993-52 a piece 6400 of a millstone 7393 upon him from the wall, 2346 that he died 4191-4 in Thebez? 8405 why went ye nigh 5066-8 the wall? 2346 then say 559-1 thou, Thy servant 5650 Uriah 223 the Hittite 2850 is dead 4191-1 also.

11:22 So the messenger 4397 went, 3212-4 and came 935-4 and shewed 5046-55 David 1732 all that Joab 3097 had sent 7971-1 him for.

11:23 And the messenger 4397 said 559-4 unto David, 1732 Surely the men 582 prevailed 1396-1 against us, and came out 3318-4 unto us into the field, 7704 and we were upon them even unto the entering 6607 of the gate. 8179

11:24 And the shooters 3384-56 shot 3384-55 from off the wall 2346 upon thy servants; 5650 and [some] of the king's 4428 servants 5650 be dead, 4191-4 and thy servant 5650 Uriah 223 the Hittite 2850 is dead 4191-1 also.

11:25 Then David 1732 said 559-4 unto the messenger, 4397 Thus shalt thou say 559-4 unto Joab, 3097 Let not this thing 1697 displease 3415-4 5869 thee, for the sword 2719 devoureth 398-4 one as 2090 well as another: 2088 make thy battle 4421 more strong 2388-54 against the city, 5892 and overthrow 2040-3 it: and encourage 2388-16 thou him.

11:26 And when the wife 802 of Uriah 223 heard 8085-4 that Uriah 223 her husband 376 was dead, 4191-1 she mourned 5594-4 for her husband. 1167

11:27 And when the mourning 60 was past, 5674-4 David 1732 sent 7971-4 and fetched 622-4 her to his house, 1004 and she became his wife, 802 and bare 3205-4 him a son. 1121 But the thing 1697 that David 1732 had done 6213-1 displeased 3415-4 5869 the LORD. 3068

12:1 And the LORD 3068 sent 7971-4 Nathan 5416 unto David. 1732 And he came 935-4 unto him, and said 559-4 unto him, There were two 8147 men 582 in one 259 city; 5892 the one 259 rich, 6223 and the other 259 poor. 7326-6

12:2 The rich 6223 [man] had exceeding 3966 many 7235-53 flocks 6629 and herds: 1241

12:3 But the poor 7326-6 [man] had nothing, save one 259 little 6996 ewe lamb, 3535 which he had bought 7069-1 and nourished up: 2421-17 and it grew up 1431-4 together 3162 with him, and with his children; 1121 it did eat 398-4 of his own meat, 6595 and drank 8354-4 of his own cup, 3563 and lay 7901-4 in his bosom, 2436 and was unto him as a daughter. 1323

12:4 And there came 935-4 a traveller 1982 unto the rich 6223 man, 376 and he spared 2550-4 to take 3947-2 of his own flock 6629 and of his own herd, 1241 to dress 6213-2 for the wayfaring man 732-6 that was come 935-6 unto him; but took 3947-4 the poor 7326-6 man's 376 lamb, 3535 and dressed 6213-4 it for the man 376 that was come 935-6 to him.

12:5 And David's 1732 anger 639 was greatly 3966 kindled 2734-4 against the man; 376 and he said 559-4 to Nathan, 5416 [As] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 the man 376 that hath done 6213-6 this [thing] shall surely 1121 die: 4194

12:6 And he shall restore 7999-17 the lamb 3535 fourfold, 706 because 6118 he did 6213-1 this thing, 1697 and because 834 he had no pity. 2550-1

12:7 And Nathan 5416 said 559-4 to David, 1732 Thou [art] the man. 376 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 I anointed 4886-1 thee king 4428 over Israel, 3478 and I delivered 5337-52 thee out of the hand 3027 of Saul; 7586

12:8 And I gave 5414-4 thee thy master's 113 house, 1004 and thy master's 113 wives 802 into thy bosom, 2436 and gave 5414-4 thee the house 1004 of Israel 3478 and of Judah; 3063 and if [that had been] too little, 4592 I would moreover have given 3254-55 unto thee such 2007 and such things. 2007

12:9 Wherefore hast thou despised 959-1 the commandment 1697 of the LORD, 3068 to do 6213-2 evil 7451 in his sight? 5869 thou hast killed 5221-52 Uriah 223 the Hittite 2850 with the sword, 2719 and hast taken 3947-1 his wife 802 [to be] thy wife, 802 and hast slain 2026-1 him with the sword 2719 of the children 1121 of Ammon. 5983

12:10 Now therefore the sword 2719 shall never 3808 5704 5769 depart 5493-4 from thine house; 1004 because 6118 thou hast despised 959-1 me, and hast taken 3947-4 the wife 802 of Uriah 223 the Hittite 2850 to be thy wife. 802

12:11 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Behold, I will raise up 6965-56 evil 7451 against thee out of thine own house, 1004 and I will take 3947-1 thy wives 802 before thine eyes, 5869 and give 5414-1 [them] unto thy neighbour, 7453 and he shall lie 7901-1 with thy wives 802 in the sight 5869 of this sun. 8121

12:12 For thou didst 6213-1 [it] secretly: 5643 but I will do 6213-4 this thing 1697 before all Israel, 3478 and before the sun. 8121

12:13 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto Nathan, 5416 I have sinned 2398-1 against the LORD. 3068 And Nathan 5416 said 559-4 unto David, 1732 The LORD 3068 also hath put away 5674-52 thy sin; 2403 thou shalt not die. 4191-4

12:14 Howbeit, 657 because by this deed 1697 thou hast given great 5006-15 occasion to the enemies 341-6 of the LORD 3068 to blaspheme, 5006-14 the child 1121 also [that is] born 3209 unto thee shall surely 4191-2 die. 4191-4

12:15 And Nathan 5416 departed 3212-4 unto his house. 1004 And the LORD 3068 struck 5062-4 the child 3206 that Uriah's 223 wife 802 bare 3205-1 unto David, 1732 and it was very sick. 605-11

12:16 David 1732 therefore besought 1245-17 God 430 for the child; 5288 and David 1732 fasted, 6684-4 6685 and went in, 935-1 and lay 7901-1 all night 3885-1 upon the earth. 776

12:17 And the elders 2205 of his house 1004 arose, 6965-4 [and went] to him, to raise him up 6965-53 from the earth: 776 but he would 14-1 not, neither did he eat 1262-1 bread 3899 with them.

12:18 And it came to pass on the seventh 7637 day, 3117 that the child 3206 died. 4191-4 And the servants 5650 of David 1732 feared 3372-4 to tell 5046-53 him that the child 3206 was dead: 4191-1 for they said, 559-1 Behold, while the child 3206 was yet alive, 2416 we spake 1696-14 unto him, and he would not hearken 8085-1 unto our voice: 6963 how will he then 6213-1 vex 7451 himself, if we tell 559-4 him that the child 3206 is dead? 4191-1

12:19 But when David 1732 saw 7200-4 that his servants 5650 whispered, 3907-102 David 1732 perceived 995-4 that the child 3206 was dead: 4191-1 therefore David 1732 said 559-4 unto his servants, 5650 Is the child 3206 dead? 4191-1 And they said, 559-4 He is dead. 4191-1

12:20 Then David 1732 arose 6965-4 from the earth, 776 and washed, 7364-4 and anointed 5480-55 [himself], and changed 2498-17 his apparel, 8071 and came 935-4 into the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and worshipped: 7812-101 then he came 935-4 to his own house; 1004 and when he required, 7592-4 they set 7760-4 bread 3899 before him, and he did eat. 398-4

12:21 Then said 559-4 his servants 5650 unto him, What thing 1697 [is] this that thou hast done? 6213-1 thou didst fast 6684-1 and weep 1058-4 for the child, 3206 [while it was] alive; 2416 but when the child 3206 was dead, 4191-1 thou didst rise 6965-1 and eat 398-4 bread. 3899

12:22 And he said, 559-4 While the child 3206 was yet alive, 2416 I fasted 6684-1 and wept: 1058-4 for I said, 559-1 Who can tell 3045-6 [whether] GOD 3068 will be gracious 2603-1|2603-17-k to me, that the child 3206 may live? 2416

12:23 But now he is dead, 4191-1 wherefore should I fast? 6684-6 can 3201-4 I bring him back again? 7725-53 I shall go 1980-6 to him, but he shall not return 7725-4 to me.

12:24 And David 1732 comforted 5162-17 Bathsheba 1339 his wife, 802 and went in 935-4 unto her, and lay 7901-4 with her: and she bare 3205-4 a son, 1121 and he called 7121-4 his name 8034 Solomon: 8010 and the LORD 3068 loved 157-1 him.

12:25 And he sent 7971-4 by the hand 3027 of Nathan 5416 the prophet; 5030 and he called 7121-4 his name 8034 Jedidiah, 3041 because of the LORD. 3068

12:26 And Joab 3097 fought 3898-11 against Rabbah 7237 of the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 and took 3920-4 the royal 4410 city. 5892

12:27 And Joab 3097 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 to David, 1732 and said, 559-4 I have fought 3898-8 against Rabbah, 7237 and have taken 3920-1 the city 5892 of waters. 4325

12:28 Now therefore gather 622-3 the rest 3499 of the people 5971 together, and encamp 2583-3 against the city, 5892 and take 3920-3 it: lest I take 3920-4 the city, 5892 and it be called 7121-8 after my name. 8034

12:29 And David 1732 gathered 622-4 all the people 5971 together, and went 3212-4 to Rabbah, 7237 and fought 3898-11 against it, and took 3920-4 it.

12:30 And he took 3947-4 their king's 4428 crown 5850 from off his head, 7218 the weight 4948 whereof [was] a talent 3603 of gold 2091 with the precious 3368 stones: 68 and it was [set] on David's 1732 head. 7218 And he brought forth 3318-52 the spoil 7998 of the city 5892 in great 3966 abundance. 7235-53

12:31 And he brought forth 3318-52 the people 5971 that [were] therein, and put 7760-4 [them] under saws, 4050 and under harrows 2757 of iron, 1270 and under axes 4037 of iron, 1270 and made them pass 5674-52 through the brickkiln: 4404 and thus did 6213-4 he unto all the cities 5892 of the children 1121 of Ammon. 5983 So David 1732 and all the people 5971 returned 7725-4 unto Jerusalem. 3389

13:1 And it came to pass after 310 this, that Absalom 53 the son 1121 of David 1732 had a fair 3303 sister, 269 whose name 8034 [was] Tamar; 8559 and Amnon 550 the son 1121 of David 1732 loved 157-4 her.

13:2 And Amnon 550 was so vexed, 3334-4 that he fell sick 2470-99 for his sister 269 Tamar; 8559 for she [was] a virgin; 1330 and Amnon 550 thought 5869 it hard 6381-11 for him to do 6213-2 any thing 3972 to her.

13:3 But Amnon 550 had a friend, 7453 whose name 8034 [was] Jonadab, 3122 the son 1121 of Shimeah 8093 David's 1732 brother: 251 and Jonadab 3122 [was] a very 3966 subtil 2450 man. 376

13:4 And he said 559-4 unto him, Why [art] thou, [being] the king's 4428 son, 1121 lean 1800 from day 1242 to day? 1242 wilt thou not tell 5046-55 me? And Amnon 550 said 559-4 unto him, I love 157-6 Tamar, 8559 my brother 251 Absalom's 53 sister. 269

13:5 And Jonadab 3082 said 559-4 unto him, Lay thee down 7901-3 on thy bed, 4904 and make thyself sick: 2470-100 and when thy father 1 cometh 935-1 to see 7200-2 thee, say 559-1 unto him, I pray thee, let my sister 269 Tamar 8559 come, 935-4 and give 1262-55 me meat, 3899 and dress 6213-1 the meat 1279 in my sight, 5869 that I may see 7200-4 [it], and eat 398-1 [it] at her hand. 3027

13:6 So Amnon 550 lay down, 7901-4 and made himself sick: 2470-101 and when the king 4428 was come 935-4 to see 7200-2 him, Amnon 550 said 559-4 unto the king, 4428 I pray thee, let Tamar 8559 my sister 269 come, 935-4 and make 3823-17 me a couple 8147 of cakes 3834 in my sight, 5869 that I may eat 1262-4 at her hand. 3027

13:7 Then David 1732 sent 7971-4 home 1004 to Tamar, 8559 saying, 559-2 Go 3212-3 now to thy brother 251 Amnon's 550 house, 1004 and dress 6213-3 him meat. 1279

13:8 So Tamar 8559 went 3212-4 to her brother 251 Amnon's 550 house; 1004 and he was laid down. 7901-6 And she took 3947-4 flour, 1217 and kneaded 3888-4 [it], and made cakes 3823-17 in his sight, 5869 and did bake 1310-17 the cakes. 3834

13:9 And she took 3947-4 a pan, 4958 and poured 3332-4 [them] out before 6440 him; but he refused 3985-17 to eat. 398-2 And Amnon 550 said, 559-4 Have out 3318-54 all men 376 from me. And they went out 3318-4 every man 376 from him.

13:10 And Amnon 550 said 559-4 unto Tamar, 8559 Bring 935-54 the meat 1279 into the chamber, 2315 that I may eat 1262-4 of thine hand. 3027 And Tamar 8559 took 3947-4 the cakes 3834 which she had made, 6213-1 and brought 935-55 [them] into the chamber 2315 to Amnon 550 her brother. 251

13:11 And when she had brought 5066-55 [them] unto him to eat, 398-2 he took hold 2388-55 of her, and said 559-4 unto her, Come 935-3 lie 7901-3 with me, my sister. 269

13:12 And she answered 559-4 him, Nay, my brother, 251 do not force 6031-17 me; for no such thing 3651 ought to be done 6213-11 in Israel: 3478 do 6213-4 not thou this folly. 5039

13:13 And I, whither shall I cause my shame 2781 to go? 3212-55 and as for thee, thou shalt be as one 259 of the fools 5036 in Israel. 3478 Now therefore, I pray thee, speak 1696-16 unto the king; 4428 for he will not withhold 4513-4 me from thee.

13:14 Howbeit he would 14-1 not hearken 8085-2 unto her voice: 6963 but, being stronger 2388-4 than she, forced 6031-17 her, and lay 7901-4 with her.

13:15 Then Amnon 550 hated 8130-4 her exceedingly; 3966 1419 so that the hatred 8135 wherewith he hated 8130-1 her [was] greater 1419 than the love 160 wherewith he had loved 157-1 her. And Amnon 550 said 559-4 unto her, Arise, 6965-3 be gone. 3212-3

13:16 And she said 559-4 unto him, [There is] no cause: 182 this evil 7451 in sending me away 7971-15 [is] greater 1419 than the other 312 that thou didst 6213-1 unto me. But he would 14-1 not hearken 8085-2 unto her.

13:17 Then he called 7121-4 his servant 5288 that ministered 8334-18 unto him, and said, 559-4 Put 7971-3 now this [woman] out 2351 from me, and bolt 5274-3 the door 1817 after 310 her.

13:18 And [she had] a garment 3801 of divers colours 6446 upon her: for with such robes 4598 were the king's 4428 daughters 1323 [that were] virgins 1330 apparelled. 3847-4 Then his servant 8334-18 brought 3318-55 her out, 2351 and bolted 5274-1 the door 1817 after 310 her.

13:19 And Tamar 8559 put 3947-4 ashes 665 on her head, 7218 and rent 7167-1 her garment 3801 of divers colours 6446 that [was] on her, and laid 7760-4 her hand 3027 on her head, 7218 and went 3212-4 on 1980-2 crying. 2199-1

13:20 And Absalom 53 her brother 251 said 559-4 unto her, Hath Amnon 550 thy brother 251 been with thee? but hold now thy peace, 2790-54 my sister: 269 he [is] thy brother; 251 regard 7896-4 3820 not this thing. 1697 So Tamar 8559 remained 3427-4 desolate 8074-6 in her brother 251 Absalom's 53 house. 1004

13:21 But when king 4428 David 1732 heard 8085-1 of all these things, 1697 he was very 3966 wroth. 2734-4

13:22 And Absalom 53 spake 1696-14 unto his brother Amnon 550 neither good 2896 nor bad: 7451 for Absalom 53 hated 8130-1 Amnon, 550 because 1697 he had forced 6031-14 his sister 269 Tamar. 8559

13:23 And it came to pass after two full 3117 years, 8141 that Absalom 53 had sheepshearers 1494-6 in Baalhazor, 1178 which [is] beside Ephraim: 669 and Absalom 53 invited 7121-4 all the king's 4428 sons. 1121

13:24 And Absalom 53 came 935-4 to the king, 4428 and said, 559-4 Behold now, thy servant 5650 hath sheepshearers; 1494-6 let the king, 4428 I beseech thee, and his servants 5650 go 3212-4 with thy servant. 5650

13:25 And the king 4428 said 559-4 to Absalom, 53 Nay, my son, 1121 let us not all now go, 3212-4 lest we be chargeable 3513-4 unto thee. And he pressed 6555-4 him: howbeit he would 14-1 not go, 3212-2 but blessed 1288-17 him.

13:26 Then said 559-4 Absalom, 53 If not, I pray thee, let my brother 251 Amnon 550 go 3212-4 with us. And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto him, Why should he go 3212-4 with thee?

13:27 But Absalom 53 pressed 6555-4 him, that he let Amnon 550 and all the king's 4428 sons 1121 go 7971-4 with him.

13:28 Now Absalom 53 had commanded 6680-17 his servants, 5288 saying, 559-2 Mark 7200-3 ye now when Amnon's 550 heart 3820 is merry 2896 with wine, 3196 and when I say 559-1 unto you, Smite 5221-54 Amnon; 550 then kill 4191-52 him, fear 3372-4 not: have not I commanded 6680-14 you? be courageous, 2388-3 and be valiant. 1121 2428

13:29 And the servants 5288 of Absalom 53 did 6213-4 unto Amnon 550 as Absalom 53 had commanded. 6680-14 Then all the king's 4428 sons 1121 arose, 6965-4 and every man 376 gat him up 7392-4 upon his mule, 6505 and fled. 5127-4

13:30 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, 1870 that tidings 8052 came 935-1 to David, 1732 saying, 559-2 Absalom 53 hath slain 5221-52 all the king's 4428 sons, 1121 and there is not one 259 of them left. 3498-8

13:31 Then the king 4428 arose, 6965-4 and tare 7167-4 his garments, 899 and lay 7901-4 on the earth; 776 and all his servants 5650 stood 5324-12 by with their clothes 899 rent. 7167-7

13:32 And Jonadab, 3122 the son 1121 of Shimeah 8093 David's 1732 brother, 251 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 Let not my lord 113 suppose 559-4 [that] they have slain 4191-52 all the young men 5288 the king's 4428 sons; 1121 for Amnon 550 only is dead: 4191-1 for by the appointment 6310 of Absalom 53 this hath been determined 7760-7 from the day 3117 that he forced 6031-15 his sister 269 Tamar. 8559

13:33 Now therefore let not my lord 113 the king 4428 take 7760-4 the thing 1697 to his heart, 3820 to think 559-2 that all the king's 4428 sons 1121 are dead: 4191-1 for Amnon 550 only is dead. 4191-1

13:34 But Absalom 53 fled. 1272-4 And the young man 5288 that kept the watch 6822-6 lifted up 5375-4 his eyes, 5869 and looked, 7200-4 and, behold, there came 1980-6 much 7227 people 5971 by the way 1870 of the hill 2022 side 6654 behind 310 him.

13:35 And Jonadab 3122 said 559-4 unto the king, 4428 Behold, the king's 4428 sons 1121 come: 935-1 as thy servant 5650 said, 1697 so it is.

13:36 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end 3615-15 of speaking, 1696-15 that, behold, the king's 4428 sons 1121 came, 935-1 and lifted up 5375-4 their voice 6963 and wept: 1058-4 and the king 4428 also and all his servants 5650 wept 1058-1 very 3966 sore. 1065 1419

13:37 But Absalom 53 fled, 1272-1 and went 3212-4 to Talmai, 8526 the son 1121 of Ammihud, 5991|5989-k king 4428 of Geshur. 1650 And [David] mourned 56-101 for his son 1121 every day. 3117

13:38 So Absalom 53 fled, 1272-1 and went 3212-4 to Geshur, 1650 and was there three 7969 years. 8141

13:39 And [the soul of] king 4428 David 1732 longed 3615-17 to go forth 3318-2 unto Absalom: 53 for he was comforted 5162-8 concerning Amnon, 550 seeing he was dead. 4191-1

14:1 Now Joab 3097 the son 1121 of Zeruiah 6870 perceived 3045-4 that the king's 4428 heart 3820 [was] toward Absalom. 53

14:2 And Joab 3097 sent 7971-4 to Tekoah, 8620 and fetched 3947-4 thence a wise 2450 woman, 802 and said 559-4 unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, 56-100 and put on 3847-3 now mourning 60 apparel, 899 and anoint 5480-4 not thyself with oil, 8081 but be as a woman 802 that had a long 7227 time 3117 mourned 56-102 for the dead: 4191-5

14:3 And come 935-1 to the king, 4428 and speak 1696-14 on this manner 1697 unto him. So Joab 3097 put 7760-4 the words 1697 in her mouth. 6310

14:4 And when the woman 802 of Tekoah 8621 spake 559-4 to the king, 4428 she fell 5307-4 on her face 639 to the ground, 776 and did obeisance, 7812-101 and said, 559-4 Help, 3467-54 O king. 4428

14:5 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, 559-4 I [am] indeed 61 a widow 490 woman, 802 and mine husband 376 is dead. 4191-4

14:6 And thy handmaid 8198 had two 8147 sons, 1121 and they two 8147 strove 5327-11 together in the field, 7704 and [there was] none to part 5337-56 them, but the one 259 smote 5221-55 the other, 259 and slew 4191-55 him.

14:7 And, behold, the whole family 4940 is risen 6965-1 against thine handmaid, 8198 and they said, 559-4 Deliver 5414-3 him that smote 5221-56 his brother, 251 that we may kill 4191-55 him, for the life 5315 of his brother 251 whom he slew; 2026-1 and we will destroy 8045-55 the heir 3423-6 also: and so they shall quench 3518-14 my coal 1513 which is left, 7604-8 and shall not leave 7760-2 to my husband 376 [neither] name 8034 nor remainder 7611 upon 6440 the earth. 127

14:8 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto the woman, 802 Go 3212-3 to thine house, 1004 and I will give charge 6680-17 concerning thee.

14:9 And the woman 802 of Tekoah 8621 said 559-4 unto the king, 4428 My lord, 113 O king, 4428 the iniquity 5771 [be] on me, and on my father's 1 house: 1004 and the king 4428 and his throne 3678 [be] guiltless. 5355

14:10 And the king 4428 said, 559-4 Whosoever saith 1696-18 [ought] unto thee, bring 935-52 him to me, and he shall not touch 5060-2 thee any more. 3254-55

14:11 Then said 559-4 she, I pray thee, let the king 4428 remember 2142-4 the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers 1350-6 of blood 1818 to destroy 7843-15 any more, 7235-53 lest they destroy 8045-55 my son. 1121 And he said, 559-4 [As] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 there shall not one hair 8185 of thy son 1121 fall 5307-4 to the earth. 776

14:12 Then the woman 802 said, 559-4 Let thine handmaid, 8198 I pray thee, speak 1696-17 [one] word 1697 unto my lord 113 the king. 4428 And he said, 559-4 Say on. 1696-16

14:13 And the woman 802 said, 559-4 Wherefore then hast thou thought 2803-1 such a thing against the people 5971 of God? 430 for the king 4428 doth speak 1696-102 this thing 1697 as one which is faulty, 818 in that the king 4428 doth not fetch home again 7725-53 his banished. 5080-12

14:14 For we must needs 4191-2 die, 4191-4 and [are] as water 4325 spilt 5064-12 on the ground, 776 which cannot be gathered 622-11 up again; neither doth God 430 respect 5375-4 [any] person: 5315 yet doth he devise 2803-1 means, 4284 that his banished 5080-12 be not expelled 5080-4 from him.

14:15 Now therefore that I am come 935-1 to speak 1696-15 of this thing 1697 unto my lord 113 the king, 4428 [it is] because the people 5971 have made me afraid: 3372-14 and thy handmaid 8198 said, 559-4 I will now speak 1696-17 unto the king; 4428 it may be that the king 4428 will perform 6213-4 the request 1697 of his handmaid. 519

14:16 For the king 4428 will hear, 8085-4 to deliver 5337-53 his handmaid 519 out of the hand 3709 of the man 376 [that would] destroy 8045-53 me and my son 1121 together 3162 out of the inheritance 5159 of God. 430

14:17 Then thine handmaid 8198 said, 559-4 The word 1697 of my lord 113 the king 4428 shall now be comfortable: 4496 for as an angel 4397 of God, 430 so [is] my lord 113 the king 4428 to discern 8085-2 good 2896 and bad: 7451 therefore the LORD 3068 thy God 430 will be with thee.

14:18 Then the king 4428 answered 6030-4 and said 559-4 unto the woman, 802 Hide 3582-17 not from me, I pray thee, the thing 1697 that I shall ask 7592-6 thee. And the woman 802 said, 559-4 Let my lord 113 the king 4428 now speak. 1696-17

14:19 And the king 4428 said, 559-4 [Is not] the hand 3027 of Joab 3097 with thee in all this? And the woman 802 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 [As] thy soul 5315 liveth, 2416 my lord 113 the king, 4428 none 376 can 786 turn to the right hand 3231-53 or to the left 8041-53 from ought that my lord 113 the king 4428 hath spoken: 1696-14 for thy servant 5650 Joab, 3097 he bade 6680-14 me, and he put 7760-1 all these words 1697 in the mouth 6310 of thine handmaid: 8198

14:20 To 5668 fetch about 5437-15 this form 6440 of speech 1697 hath thy servant 5650 Joab 3097 done 6213-1 this thing: 1697 and my lord 113 [is] wise, 2450 according to the wisdom 2451 of an angel 4397 of God, 430 to know 3045-2 all [things] that [are] in the earth. 776

14:21 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto Joab, 3097 Behold now, I have done 6213-1 this thing: 1697 go 3212-3 therefore, bring the young man 5288 Absalom 53 again. 7725-54

14:22 And Joab 3097 fell 5307-4 to the ground 776 on his face, 6440 and bowed 7812-101 himself, and thanked 1288-17 the king: 4428 and Joab 3097 said, 559-4 To day 3117 thy servant 5650 knoweth 3045-1 that I have found 4672-1 grace 2580 in thy sight, 5869 my lord, 113 O king, 4428 in that the king 4428 hath fulfilled 6213-1 the request 1697 of his servant. 5650

14:23 So Joab 3097 arose 6965-4 and went 3212-4 to Geshur, 1650 and brought 935-55 Absalom 53 to Jerusalem. 3389

14:24 And the king 4428 said, 559-4 Let him turn 5437-11 to his own house, 1004 and let him not see 7200-4 my face. 6440 So Absalom 53 returned 5437-11 to his own house, 1004 and saw 7200-1 not the king's 4428 face. 6440

14:25 But in all Israel 3478 there was none 376 to be so much 3966 praised 1984-15 as Absalom 53 for his beauty: 3303 from the sole 3709 of his foot 7272 even to the crown of his head 6936 there was no blemish 3971 in him.

14:26 And when he polled 1548-15 his head, 7218 (for it was at every year's 3117 3117 end 7093 that he polled 1548-17 [it]: because [the hair] was heavy 3513-1 on him, therefore he polled 1548-14 it:) he weighed 8254-1 the hair 8181 of his head 7218 at two hundred 3967 shekels 8255 after the king's 4428 weight. 68

14:27 And unto Absalom 53 there were born 3205-11 three 7969 sons, 1121 and one 259 daughter, 1323 whose name 8034 [was] Tamar: 8559 she was a woman 802 of a fair 3303 countenance. 4758

14:28 So Absalom 53 dwelt 3427-4 two full 3117 years 8141 in Jerusalem, 3389 and saw 7200-1 not the king's 4428 face. 6440

14:29 Therefore Absalom 53 sent 7971-4 for Joab, 3097 to have sent 7971-2 him to the king; 4428 but he would 14-1 not come 935-2 to him: and when he sent 7971-4 again the second time, 8145 he would 14-1 not come. 935-2

14:30 Therefore he said 559-4 unto his servants, 5650 See, 7200-3 Joab's 3097 field 2513 is near 413 mine, 3027 and he hath barley 8184 there; go 3212-3 and set it 3341-54 on fire. 784 And Absalom's 53 servants 5650 set 3341-55 the field 2513 on fire. 784

14:31 Then Joab 3097 arose, 6965-4 and came 935-4 to Absalom 53 unto [his] house, 1004 and said 559-4 unto him, Wherefore have thy servants 5650 set 3341-52 my field 2513 on fire? 784

14:32 And Absalom 53 answered 559-4 Joab, 3097 Behold, I sent 7971-1 unto thee, saying, 559-2 Come 935-3 hither, that I may send 7971-4 thee to the king, 4428 to say, 559-2 Wherefore am I come 935-1 from Geshur? 1650 [it had been] good 2896 for me [to have been] there still: now therefore let me see 7200-4 the king's 4428 face; 6440 and if there be 3426 [any] iniquity 5771 in me, let him kill 4191-52 me.

14:33 So Joab 3097 came 935-4 to the king, 4428 and told 5046-55 him: and when he had called 7121-4 for Absalom, 53 he came 935-4 to the king, 4428 and bowed 7812-101 himself on his face 639 to the ground 776 before 6440 the king: 4428 and the king 4428 kissed 5401-4 Absalom. 53

15:1 And it came to pass after 310 this, that Absalom 53 prepared 6213-4 him chariots 4818 and horses, 5483 and fifty 2572 men 376 to run 7323-5 before 6440 him.

15:2 And Absalom 53 rose up early, 7925-52 and stood 5975-1 beside 3027 the way 1870 of the gate: 8179 and it was [so], that when any man 376 that had a controversy 7379 came 935-2 to the king 4428 for judgment, 4941 then Absalom 53 called 7121-4 unto him, and said, 559-4 Of what 335 city 5892 [art] thou? And he said, 559-4 Thy servant 5650 [is] of one 259 of the tribes 7626 of Israel. 3478

15:3 And Absalom 53 said 559-4 unto him, See, 7200-3 thy matters 1697 [are] good 2896 and right; 5228 but [there is] no man [deputed] of the king 4428 to hear 8085-6 thee.

15:4 Absalom 53 said 559-4 moreover, Oh that I were made 7760-4 judge 8199-6 in the land, 776 that every man 376 which hath any suit 7379 or cause 4941 might come 935-4 unto me, and I would do him justice! 6663-52

15:5 And it was [so], that when any man 376 came nigh 7126-2 [to him] to do him obeisance, 7812-99 he put forth 7971-1 his hand, 3027 and took 2388-52 him, and kissed 5401-1 him.

15:6 And on this manner 1697 did 6213-4 Absalom 53 to all Israel 3478 that came 935-4 to the king 4428 for judgment: 4941 so Absalom 53 stole 1589-17 the hearts 3820 of the men 582 of Israel. 3478

15:7 And it came to pass after 7093 forty 705 years, 8141 that Absalom 53 said 559-4 unto the king, 4428 I pray thee, let me go 3212-4 and pay 7999-17 my vow, 5088 which I have vowed 5087-1 unto the LORD, 3068 in Hebron. 2275

15:8 For thy servant 5650 vowed 5087-1 a vow 5088 while I abode 3427-2 at Geshur 1650 in Syria, 758 saying, 559-2 If the LORD 3068 shall bring me again 7725-4|7725-55-q indeed to Jerusalem, 3389 then I will serve 5647-1 the LORD. 3068

15:9 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto him, Go 3212-3 in peace. 7965 So he arose, 6965-4 and went 3212-4 to Hebron. 2275

15:10 But Absalom 53 sent 7971-4 spies 7270-18 throughout all the tribes 7626 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 As soon as ye hear 8085-2 the sound 6963 of the trumpet, 7782 then ye shall say, 559-1 Absalom 53 reigneth 4427-1 in Hebron. 2275

15:11 And with Absalom 53 went 1980-1 two hundred 3967 men 376 out of Jerusalem, 3389 [that were] called; 7121-7 and they went 1980-6 in their simplicity, 8537 and they knew 3045-1 not any thing. 1697

15:12 And Absalom 53 sent 7971-4 for Ahithophel 302 the Gilonite, 1526 David's 1732 counsellor, 3289-6 from his city, 5892 [even] from Giloh, 1542 while he offered 2076-2 sacrifices. 2077 And the conspiracy 7195 was strong; 533 for the people 5971 increased 7227 continually 1980-6 with Absalom. 53

15:13 And there came 935-4 a messenger 5046-56 to David, 1732 saying, 559-2 The hearts 3820 of the men 376 of Israel 3478 are after 310 Absalom. 53

15:14 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto all his servants 5650 that [were] with him at Jerusalem, 3389 Arise, 6965-3 and let us flee; 1272-4 for we shall not [else] escape 6413 from 6440 Absalom: 53 make speed 4116-16 to depart, 3212-2 lest he overtake 5381-52 us suddenly, 4116-17 and bring 5080-52 evil 7451 upon us, and smite 5221-52 the city 5892 with the edge 6310 of the sword. 2719

15:15 And the king's 4428 servants 5650 said 559-4 unto the king, 4428 Behold, thy servants 5650 [are ready to do] whatsoever my lord 113 the king 4428 shall appoint. 977-4

15:16 And the king 4428 went forth, 3318-4 and all his household 1004 after 7272 him. And the king 4428 left 5800-4 ten 6235 women, 802 [which were] concubines, 6370 to keep 8104-2 the house. 1004

15:17 And the king 4428 went forth, 3318-4 and all the people 5971 after 7272 him, and tarried 5975-4 in a place that was far off. 1004|4801|1023

15:18 And all his servants 5650 passed on 5674-6 beside him; 3027 and all the Cherethites, 3774 and all the Pelethites, 6432 and all the Gittites, 1663 six 8337 hundred 3967 men 376 which came 935-1 after 7272 him from Gath, 1661 passed on 5674-6 before 6440 the king. 4428

15:19 Then said 559-4 the king 4428 to Ittai 863 the Gittite, 1663 Wherefore goest 3212-4 thou also with us? return 7725-3 to thy place, 4725 and abide 3427-3 with the king: 4428 for thou [art] a stranger, 5237 and also an exile. 1540-6

15:20 Whereas thou camest 935-2 [but] yesterday, 8543 should I this day 3117 make thee go 3212-2 up and down 5128-55|5128-4-k with us? seeing I go 1980-6 whither I may, return 7725-3 thou, and take back 7725-54 thy brethren: 251 mercy 2617 and truth 571 [be] with thee.

15:21 And Ittai 863 answered 6030-4 the king, 4428 and said, 559-4 [As] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 and [as] my lord 113 the king 4428 liveth, 2416 surely in what place 4725 my lord 113 the king 4428 shall be, whether in death 4194 or life, 2416 even there also will thy servant 5650 be.

15:22 And David 1732 said 559-4 to Ittai, 863 Go 3212-3 and pass over. 5674-3 And Ittai 863 the Gittite 1663 passed over, 5674-4 and all his men, 582 and all the little ones 2945 that [were] with him.

15:23 And all the country 776 wept 1058-6 with a loud 1419 voice, 6963 and all the people 5971 passed over: 5674-6 the king 4428 also himself passed over 5674-6 the brook 5158 Kidron, 6939 and all the people 5971 passed over, 5674-6 toward 6440 the way 1870 of the wilderness. 4057

15:24 And lo Zadok 6659 also, and all the Levites 3881 [were] with him, bearing 5375-6 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of God: 430 and they set down 3332-55 the ark 727 of God; 430 and Abiathar 54 went up, 5927-4 until all the people 5971 had done 8552-2 passing 5674-2 out of the city. 5892

15:25 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto Zadok, 6659 Carry back 7725-54 the ark 727 of God 430 into the city: 5892 if I shall find 4672-4 favour 2580 in the eyes 5869 of the LORD, 3068 he will bring me again, 7725-52 and shew 7200-52 me [both] it, and his habitation: 5116

15:26 But if he thus say, 559-4 I have no delight 2654-1 in thee; behold, [here am] I, let him do 6213-4 to me as seemeth 5869 good 2896 unto him.

15:27 The king 4428 said 559-4 also unto Zadok 6659 the priest, 3548 [Art not] thou a seer? 7200-6 return 7725-3 into the city 5892 in peace, 7965 and your two 8147 sons 1121 with you, Ahimaaz 290 thy son, 1121 and Jonathan 3083 the son 1121 of Abiathar. 54

15:28 See, 7200-3 I will tarry 4102-119 in the plain 6160|5679-k of the wilderness, 4057 until there come 935-2 word 1697 from you to certify 5046-53 me.

15:29 Zadok 6659 therefore and Abiathar 54 carried the ark 727 of God 430 again 7725-55 to Jerusalem: 3389 and they tarried 3427-4 there.

15:30 And David 1732 went up 5927-6 by the ascent 4608 of [mount] Olivet, 2132 and wept 1058-6 as he went up, 5927-6 and had his head 7218 covered, 2645-6 and he went 1980-6 barefoot: 3182 and all the people 5971 that [was] with him covered 2645-1 every man 376 his head, 7218 and they went up, 5927-1 weeping 1058-2 as they went up. 5927-2

15:31 And [one] told 5046-52 David, 1732 saying, 559-2 Ahithophel 302 [is] among the conspirators 7194-6 with Absalom. 53 And David 1732 said, 559-4 O LORD, 3068 I pray thee, turn the counsel 6098 of Ahithophel 302 into foolishness. 5528-16

15:32 And it came to pass, that [when] David 1732 was come 935-1 to the top 7218 [of the mount], where he worshipped 7812-101 God, 430 behold, Hushai 2365 the Archite 757 came to meet 7125-2 him with his coat 3801 rent, 7167-7 and earth 127 upon his head: 7218

15:33 Unto whom David 1732 said, 559-4 If thou passest on 5674-1 with me, then thou shalt be a burden 4853 unto me:

15:34 But if thou return 7725-4 to the city, 5892 and say 559-1 unto Absalom, 53 I will be thy servant, 5650 O king; 4428 [as] I [have been] thy father's 1 servant 5650 hitherto, 227 so [will] I now also [be] thy servant: 5650 then mayest thou for me defeat 6565-52 the counsel 6098 of Ahithophel. 302

15:35 And [hast thou] not there with thee Zadok 6659 and Abiathar 54 the priests? 3548 therefore it shall be, [that] what thing 1697 soever thou shalt hear 8085-4 out of the king's 4428 house, 1004 thou shalt tell 5046-55 [it] to Zadok 6659 and Abiathar 54 the priests. 3548

15:36 Behold, [they have] there with them their two 8147 sons, 1121 Ahimaaz 290 Zadok's 6659 [son], and Jonathan 3083 Abiathar's 54 [son]; and by them 3027 ye shall send 7971-1 unto me every thing 1697 that ye can hear. 8085-4

15:37 So Hushai 2365 David's 1732 friend 7463 came 935-4 into the city, 5892 and Absalom 53 came 935-4 into Jerusalem. 3389

16:1 And when David 1732 was a little 4592 past 5674-1 the top 7218 [of the hill], behold, Ziba 6717 the servant 5288 of Mephibosheth 4648 met 7125-2 him, with a couple 6776 of asses 2543 saddled, 2280-7 and upon them two hundred 3967 [loaves] of bread, 3899 and an hundred 3967 bunches of raisins, 6778 and an hundred 3967 of summer fruits, 7019 and a bottle 5035 of wine. 3196

16:2 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto Ziba, 6717 What meanest thou by these? And Ziba 6717 said, 559-4 The asses 2543 [be] for the king's 4428 household 1004 to ride on; 7392-2 and the bread 3899 and summer fruit 7019 for the young men 5288 to eat; 398-2 and the wine, 3196 that such as be faint 3287 in the wilderness 4057 may drink. 8354-2

16:3 And the king 4428 said, 559-4 And where [is] thy master's 113 son? 1121 And Ziba 6717 said 559-4 unto the king, 4428 Behold, he abideth 3427-6 at Jerusalem: 3389 for he said, 559-1 To day 3117 shall the house 1004 of Israel 3478 restore 7725-55 me the kingdom 4468 of my father. 1

16:4 Then said 559-4 the king 4428 to Ziba, 6717 Behold, thine [are] all that [pertained] unto Mephibosheth. 4648 And Ziba 6717 said, 559-4 I humbly beseech 7812-98 thee [that] I may find 4672-4 grace 2580 in thy sight, 5869 my lord, 113 O king. 4428

16:5 And when king 4428 David 1732 came 935-1 to Bahurim, 980 behold, thence came out 3318-6 a man 376 of the family 4940 of the house 1004 of Saul, 7586 whose name 8034 [was] Shimei, 8096 the son 1121 of Gera: 1617 he came forth, 3318-6 and cursed 7043-18 still as he came. 3318-2

16:6 And he cast 5619-17 stones 68 at David, 1732 and at all the servants 5650 of king 4428 David: 1732 and all the people 5971 and all the mighty men 1368 [were] on his right hand 3225 and on his left. 8040

16:7 And thus said 559-1 Shimei 8096 when he cursed, 7043-15 Come out, 3318-3 come out, 3318-3 thou bloody 1818 man, 376 and thou man 376 of Belial: 1100

16:8 The LORD 3068 hath returned 7725-52 upon thee all the blood 1818 of the house 1004 of Saul, 7586 in whose stead thou hast reigned; 4427-1 and the LORD 3068 hath delivered 5414-4 the kingdom 4410 into the hand 3027 of Absalom 53 thy son: 1121 and, behold, thou [art taken] in thy mischief, 7451 because thou [art] a bloody 1818 man. 376

16:9 Then said 559-4 Abishai 52 the son 1121 of Zeruiah 6870 unto the king, 4428 Why should this dead 4191-5 dog 3611 curse 7043-17 my lord 113 the king? 4428 let me go over, 5674-4 I pray thee, and take off 5493-55 his head. 7218

16:10 And the king 4428 said, 559-4 What have I to do with you, ye sons 1121 of Zeruiah? 6870 so let him curse, 7043-17 because the LORD 3068 hath said 559-1 unto him, Curse 7043-16 David. 1732 Who shall then say, 559-4 Wherefore hast thou done 6213-1 so?

16:11 And David 1732 said 559-4 to Abishai, 52 and to all his servants, 5650 Behold, my son, 1121 which came forth 3318-1 of my bowels, 4578 seeketh 1245-18 my life: 5315 how much more now [may this] Benjamite 1145 [do it]? let him alone, 3240-54 and let him curse; 7043-17 for the LORD 3068 hath bidden 559-1 him.

16:12 It may be that the LORD 3068 will look 7200-4 on mine affliction, 5869|6040-k and that the LORD 3068 will requite 7725-52 me good 2896 for his cursing 7045 this day. 3117

16:13 And as David 1732 and his men 582 went 3212-4 by the way, 1870 Shimei 8096 went along 1980-6 on the hill's 2022 side 6763 over against 5980 him, and cursed 7043-17 as he went, 1980-2 and threw 5619-17 stones 68 at 5980 him, and cast 6080-14 dust. 6083

16:14 And the king, 4428 and all the people 5971 that [were] with him, came 935-4 weary, 5889 and refreshed 5314-11 themselves there.

16:15 And Absalom, 53 and all the people 5971 the men 376 of Israel, 3478 came 935-1 to Jerusalem, 3389 and Ahithophel 302 with him.

16:16 And it came to pass, when Hushai 2365 the Archite, 757 David's 1732 friend, 7463 was come 935-1 unto Absalom, 53 that Hushai 2365 said 559-4 unto Absalom, 53 God save 2421-4 the king, 4428 God save 2421-4 the king. 4428

16:17 And Absalom 53 said 559-4 to Hushai, 2365 [Is] this thy kindness 2617 to thy friend? 7453 why wentest 1980-1 thou not with thy friend? 7453

16:18 And Hushai 2365 said 559-4 unto Absalom, 53 Nay; but whom the LORD, 3068 and this people, 5971 and all the men 376 of Israel, 3478 choose, 977-1 his will I be, and with him will I abide. 3427-4

16:19 And again, 8145 whom should I serve? 5647-4 [should I] not [serve] in the presence 6440 of his son? 1121 as I have served 5647-1 in thy father's 1 presence, 6440 so will I be in thy presence. 6440

16:20 Then said 559-4 Absalom 53 to Ahithophel, 302 Give 3051-3 counsel 6098 among you what we shall do. 6213-4

16:21 And Ahithophel 302 said 559-4 unto Absalom, 53 Go in 935-3 unto thy father's 1 concubines, 6370 which he hath left 3240-52 to keep 8104-2 the house; 1004 and all Israel 3478 shall hear 8085-1 that thou art abhorred 887-8 of thy father: 1 then shall the hands 3027 of all that [are] with thee be strong. 2388-1

16:22 So they spread 5186-55 Absalom 53 a tent 168 upon the top 1406 of the house; and Absalom 53 went in 935-4 unto his father's 1 concubines 6370 in the sight 5869 of all Israel. 3478

16:23 And the counsel 6098 of Ahithophel, 302 which he counselled 3289-1 in those days, 3117 [was] as if a man 376-q had enquired 7592-4 at the oracle 1697 of God: 430 so [was] all the counsel 6098 of Ahithophel 302 both with David 1732 and with Absalom. 53

17:1 Moreover Ahithophel 302 said 559-4 unto Absalom, 53 Let me now choose 977-4 out twelve 8147 6240 thousand 505 men, 376 and I will arise 6965-4 and pursue 7291-4 after 310 David 1732 this night: 3915

17:2 And I will come 935-4 upon him while he [is] weary 3023 and weak 7504 handed, 3027 and will make him afraid: 2729-52 and all the people 5971 that [are] with him shall flee; 5127-1 and I will smite 5221-52 the king 4428 only:

17:3 And I will bring back 7725-55 all the people 5971 unto thee: the man 376 whom thou seekest 1245-18 [is] as if all returned: 7725-2 [so] all the people 5971 shall be in peace. 7965

17:4 And the saying 1697 pleased 3474-4 5869 Absalom 53 well, and 5869 all the elders 2205 of Israel. 3478

17:5 Then said 559-4 Absalom, 53 Call 7121-3 now Hushai 2365 the Archite 757 also, and let us hear 8085-4 likewise what he saith. 6310

17:6 And when Hushai 2365 was come 935-4 to Absalom, 53 Absalom 53 spake 559-4 unto him, saying, 559-2 Ahithophel 302 hath spoken 1696-14 after this manner: 1697 shall we do 6213-4 [after] his saying? 1697 if not; speak 1696-16 thou.

17:7 And Hushai 2365 said 559-4 unto Absalom, 53 The counsel 6098 that Ahithophel 302 hath given 3289-1 [is] not good 2896 at this time. 6471

17:8 For, said 559-4 Hushai, 2365 thou knowest 3045-1 thy father 1 and his men, 582 that they [be] mighty men, 1368 and they [be] chafed 4751 in their minds, 5315 as a bear 1677 robbed 7909 of her whelps in the field: 7704 and thy father 1 [is] a man 376 of war, 4421 and will not lodge 3885-4 with the people. 5971

17:9 Behold, he is hid 2244-12 now in some 259 pit, 6354 or in some 259 [other] place: 4725 and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown 5307-2 at the first, 8462 that whosoever 8085-6 heareth 8085-1 it will say, 559-1 There is a slaughter 4046 among the people 5971 that follow 310 Absalom. 53

17:10 And he also [that is] valiant, 1121 2428 whose heart 3820 [is] as the heart 3820 of a lion, 738 shall utterly 4549-9 melt: 4549-11 for all Israel 3478 knoweth 3045-6 that thy father 1 [is] a mighty man, 1368 and [they] which [be] with him [are] valiant 2428 men. 1121

17:11 Therefore I counsel 3289-1 that all Israel 3478 be generally 622-9 gathered 622-11 unto thee, from Dan 1835 even to Beersheba, 884 as the sand 2344 that [is] by the sea 3220 for multitude; 7230 and that thou go 1980-6 to battle 7128 in thine own person. 6440

17:12 So shall we come 935-1 upon him in some 259 place 4725 where he shall be found, 4672-8 and we 5168 will light upon him as the dew 2919 falleth 5307-4 on the ground: 127 and of him and of all the men 582 that [are] with him there shall not be left 3498-8 so much as 1571 one. 259

17:13 Moreover, if 518 he be gotten 622-11 into a city, 5892 then shall all Israel 3478 bring 5375-52 ropes 2256 to that city, 5892 and we will draw 5498-1 it into the river, 5158 until there be not one 1571 small stone 6872 found 4672-8 there.

17:14 And Absalom 53 and all the men 376 of Israel 3478 said, 559-4 The counsel 6098 of Hushai 2365 the Archite 757 [is] better 2896 than the counsel 6098 of Ahithophel. 302 For the LORD 3068 had appointed 6680-14 to defeat 6565-53 the good 2896 counsel 6098 of Ahithophel, 302 to the intent that 5668 the LORD 3068 might bring 935-53 evil 7451 upon Absalom. 53

17:15 Then said 559-4 Hushai 2365 unto Zadok 6659 and to Abiathar 54 the priests, 3548 Thus and thus did Ahithophel 302 counsel 3289-1 Absalom 53 and the elders 2205 of Israel; 3478 and thus and thus have I counselled. 3289-1

17:16 Now therefore send 7971-3 quickly, 4120 and tell 5046-54 David, 1732 saying, 559-2 Lodge 3885-4 not this night 3915 in the plains 6160|5679-k of the wilderness, 4057 but speedily 5674-2 pass over; 5674-4 lest the king 4428 be swallowed up, 1104-29 and all the people 5971 that [are] with him.

17:17 Now Jonathan 3083 and Ahimaaz 290 stayed 5975-6 by Enrogel; 5883 for they might 3201-4 not be seen 7200-9 to come 935-2 into the city: 5892 and a wench 8198 went 1980-1 and told 5046-52 them; and they went 3212-4 and told 5046-52 king 4428 David. 1732

17:18 Nevertheless a lad 5288 saw 7200-4 them, and told 5046-55 Absalom: 53 but they went 3212-4 both 8147 of them away quickly, 4120 and came 935-4 to a man's 376 house 1004 in Bahurim, 980 which had a well 875 in his court; 2691 whither 8033 they went down. 3381-4

17:19 And the woman 802 took 3947-4 and spread 6566-4 a covering 4539 over the well's 875 mouth, 6440 and spread 7849-4 ground corn 7383 thereon; and the thing 1697 was not known. 3045-8

17:20 And when Absalom's 53 servants 5650 came 935-4 to the woman 802 to the house, 1004 they said, 559-4 Where [is] Ahimaaz 290 and Jonathan? 3083 And the woman 802 said 559-4 unto them, They be gone over 5674-1 the brook 4323 of water. 4325 And when they had sought 1245-17 and could not find 4672-1 [them], they returned 7725-4 to Jerusalem. 3389

17:21 And it came to pass, after 310 they were departed, 3212-2 that they came up 5927-4 out of the well, 875 and went 3212-4 and told 5046-55 king 4428 David, 1732 and said 559-4 unto David, 1732 Arise, 6965-3 and pass quickly 4120 over 5674-3 the water: 4325 for thus hath Ahithophel 302 counselled 3289-1 against you.

17:22 Then David 1732 arose, 6965-4 and all the people 5971 that [were] with him, and they passed over 5674-4 Jordan: 3383 by the morning 1242 light 216 there lacked 5737-8 not one 259 of them that was not gone over 5674-1 Jordan. 3383

17:23 And when Ahithophel 302 saw 7200-1 that his counsel 6098 was not followed, 6213-8 he saddled 2280-4 [his] ass, 2543 and arose, 6965-4 and gat 3212-4 him home to his house, 1004 to his city, 5892 and put his household 1004 in order, 6680-17 and hanged 2614-11 himself, and died, 4191-4 and was buried 6912-11 in the sepulchre 6913 of his father. 1

17:24 Then David 1732 came 935-1 to Mahanaim. 4266 And Absalom 53 passed over 5674-1 Jordan, 3383 he and all the men 376 of Israel 3478 with him.

17:25 And Absalom 53 made 7760-1 Amasa 6021 captain of the host 6635 instead of Joab: 3097 which Amasa 6021 [was] a man's 376 son, 1121 whose name 8034 [was] Ithra 3501 an Israelite, 3481 that went in 935-1 to Abigail 26 the daughter 1323 of Nahash, 5176 sister 269 to Zeruiah 6870 Joab's 3097 mother. 517

17:26 So Israel 3478 and Absalom 53 pitched 2583-4 in the land 776 of Gilead. 1568

17:27 And it came to pass, when David 1732 was come 935-2 to Mahanaim, 4266 that Shobi 7629 the son 1121 of Nahash 5176 of Rabbah 7237 of the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 and Machir 4353 the son 1121 of Ammiel 5988 of Lodebar, 3810 and Barzillai 1271 the Gileadite 1569 of Rogelim, 7274

17:28 Brought 5066-52 beds, 4904 and basons, 5592 and earthen 3335-6 vessels, 3627 and wheat, 2406 and barley, 8184 and flour, 7058 and parched 7039 [corn], and beans, 6321 and lentiles, 5742 and parched 7039 [pulse],

17:29 And honey, 1706 and butter, 2529 and sheep, 6629 and cheese 8194 of kine, 1241 for David, 1732 and for the people 5971 that [were] with him, to eat: 398-2 for they said, 559-1 The people 5971 [is] hungry, 7457 and weary, 5889 and thirsty, 6771 in the wilderness. 4057

18:1 And David 1732 numbered 6485-4 the people 5971 that [were] with him, and set 7760-4 captains 8269 of thousands 505 and captains 8269 of hundreds 3967 over them.

18:2 And David 1732 sent forth 7971-17 a third part 7992 of the people 5971 under the hand 3027 of Joab, 3097 and a third part 7992 under the hand 3027 of Abishai 52 the son 1121 of Zeruiah, 6870 Joab's 3097 brother, 251 and a third part 7992 under the hand 3027 of Ittai 863 the Gittite. 1663 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto the people, 5971 I will surely 3318-2 go forth 3318-4 with you myself 589 also.

18:3 But the people 5971 answered, 559-4 Thou shalt not go forth: 3318-4 for if we flee 5127-4 away, 5127-2 they will not care 7760-4 3820 for us; neither if half 2677 of us die, 4191-4 will they care 7760-4 3820 for us: but now [thou art] worth 3644 ten 6235 thousand 505 of us: therefore now [it is] better 2896 that thou succour 5826-2|5826-53-k us out of the city. 5892

18:4 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto them, What seemeth 5869 you best 3190-4 I will do. 6213-4 And the king 4428 stood 5975-4 by the gate 8179 side, 3027 and all the people 5971 came out 3318-1 by hundreds 3967 and by thousands. 505

18:5 And the king 4428 commanded 6680-17 Joab 3097 and Abishai 52 and Ittai, 863 saying, 559-2 [Deal] gently 328 for my sake with the young man, 5288 [even] with Absalom. 53 And all the people 5971 heard 8085-1 when the king 4428 gave all the captains 8269 charge 6680-15 concerning 1697 Absalom. 53

18:6 So the people 5971 went out 3318-4 into the field 7704 against 7125-2 Israel: 3478 and the battle 4421 was in the wood 3293 of Ephraim; 669

18:7 Where the people 5971 of Israel 3478 were slain 5062-11 before 6440 the servants 5650 of David, 1732 and there was there a great 1419 slaughter 4046 that day 3117 of twenty 6242 thousand 505 [men].

18:8 For the battle 4421 was there scattered 6327-12 over the face 6440 of all the country: 776 and the wood 3293 devoured 398-2 more 7235-55 people 5971 that day 3117 than the sword 2719 devoured. 398-1

18:9 And Absalom 53 met 7122-11 the servants 6440 5650 of David. 1732 And Absalom 53 rode 7392-6 upon a mule, 6505 and the mule 6505 went 935-4 under the thick boughs 7730 of a great 1419 oak, 424 and his head 7218 caught hold 2388-4 of the oak, 424 and he was taken up 5414-93 between the heaven 8064 and the earth; 776 and the mule 6505 that [was] under him went away. 5674-1

18:10 And a certain 259 man 376 saw 7200-4 [it], and told 5046-55 Joab, 3097 and said, 559-4 Behold, I saw 7200-1 Absalom 53 hanged 8518-7 in an oak. 424

18:11 And Joab 3097 said 559-4 unto the man 376 that told 5046-56 him, And, behold, thou sawest 7200-1 [him], and why didst thou not smite 5221-52 him there to the ground? 776 and I would have given 5414-2 thee ten 6235 [shekels] of silver, 3701 and a 259 girdle. 2290

18:12 And the man 376 said 559-4 unto Joab, 3097 Though 3863 I should receive 8254-6 a thousand 505 [shekels] of silver 3701 in mine hand, 3709 [yet] would I not put forth 7971-4 mine hand 3027 against the king's 4428 son: 1121 for in our hearing 241 the king 4428 charged 6680-14 thee and Abishai 52 and Ittai, 863 saying, 559-2 Beware 8104-3 that none [touch] the young man 5288 Absalom. 53

18:13 Otherwise 176 I should have wrought 6213-1 falsehood 8267 against mine own life: 5315 for there is no matter 1697 hid 3582-11 from the king, 4428 and thou thyself wouldest have set 3320-101 thyself against [me].

18:14 Then said 559-4 Joab, 3097 I may not tarry 3176-55 thus with 6440 thee. And he took 3947-4 three 7969 darts 7626 in his hand, 3709 and thrust 8628-4 them through the heart 3820 of Absalom, 53 while he [was] yet alive 2416 in the midst 3820 of the oak. 424

18:15 And ten 6235 young men 5288 that bare 5375-6 Joab's 3097 armour 3627 compassed about 5437-4 and smote 5221-55 Absalom, 53 and slew 4191-55 him.

18:16 And Joab 3097 blew 8628-4 the trumpet, 7782 and the people 5971 returned 7725-4 from pursuing 7291-2 after 310 Israel: 3478 for Joab 3097 held back 2820-1 the people. 5971

18:17 And they took 3947-4 Absalom, 53 and cast 7993-55 him into a great 1419 pit 6354 in the wood, 3293 and laid 5324-55 a very 3966 great 1419 heap 1530 of stones 68 upon him: and all Israel 3478 fled 5127-1 every one 376 to his tent. 168

18:18 Now Absalom 53 in his lifetime 2416 had taken 3947-1 and reared up 5324-55 for himself a pillar, 4678 which [is] in the king's 4428 dale: 6010 for he said, 559-1 I have no son 1121 to keep my name 8034 in remembrance: 2142-53 and he called 7121-4 the pillar 4678 after his own name: 8034 and it is called 7121-11 unto this day, 3117 Absalom's 53 place. 3027

18:19 Then said 559-1 Ahimaaz 290 the son 1121 of Zadok, 6659 Let me now run, 7323-4 and bear the king 4428 tidings, 1319-17 how that the LORD 3068 hath avenged 8199-1 him 3027 of his enemies. 341-6

18:20 And Joab 3097 said 559-4 unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings 1309 376 this day, 3117 but thou shalt bear tidings 1319-14 another 312 day: 3117 but this day 3117 thou shalt bear no tidings, 1319-17 because the king's 4428 son 1121 is dead. 4191-1

18:21 Then said 559-4 Joab 3097 to Cushi, 3569 Go 3212-3 tell 5046-54 the king 4428 what thou hast seen. 7200-1 And Cushi 3569 bowed 7812-101 himself unto Joab, 3097 and ran. 7323-4

18:22 Then said 559-4 Ahimaaz 290 the son 1121 of Zadok 6659 yet again 3254-55 to Joab, 3097 But howsoever, 4100 let me, I pray thee, also run 7323-4 after 310 Cushi. 3569 And Joab 3097 said, 559-4 Wherefore wilt thou run, 7323-5 my son, 1121 seeing that thou hast no tidings 1309 ready? 4672-6

18:23 But howsoever, [said he], let me run. 7323-4 And he said 559-4 unto him, Run. 7323-3 Then Ahimaaz 290 ran 7323-4 by the way 1870 of the plain, 3603 and overran 5674-4 Cushi. 3569

18:24 And David 1732 sat 3427-6 between the two 8147 gates: 8179 and the watchman 6822-6 went up 3212-4 to the roof 1406 over the gate 8179 unto the wall, 2346 and lifted up 5375-4 his eyes, 5869 and looked, 7200-4 and behold a man 376 running 7323-5 alone.

18:25 And the watchman 6822-6 cried, 7121-4 and told 5046-55 the king. 4428 And the king 4428 said, 559-4 If he [be] alone, [there is] tidings 1309 in his mouth. 6310 And he came 3212-4 apace, 1980-2 and drew near. 7131

18:26 And the watchman 6822-6 saw 7200-4 another 312 man 376 running: 7323-5 and the watchman 6822-6 called 7121-4 unto the porter, 7778 and said, 559-4 Behold [another] man 376 running 7323-5 alone. And the king 4428 said, 559-4 He also bringeth tidings. 1319-18

18:27 And the watchman 6822-6 said, 559-4 Me thinketh 7200-6 the running 4794 of the foremost 7223 is like the running 4794 of Ahimaaz 290 the son 1121 of Zadok. 6659 And the king 4428 said, 559-4 He [is] a good 2896 man, 376 and cometh 935-4 with good 2896 tidings. 1309

18:28 And Ahimaaz 290 called, 7121-4 and said 559-4 unto the king, 4428 All is well. 7965 And he fell down 7812-101 to the earth 776 upon his face 639 before the king, 4428 and said, 559-4 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 which hath delivered up 5462-14 the men 582 that lifted up 5375-1 their hand 3027 against my lord 113 the king. 4428

18:29 And the king 4428 said, 559-4 Is the young man 5288 Absalom 53 safe? 7965 And Ahimaaz 290 answered, 559-4 When Joab 3097 sent 7971-2 the king's 4428 servant, 5650 and [me] thy servant, 5650 I saw 7200-1 a great 1419 tumult, 1995 but I knew 3045-1 not what [it was].

18:30 And the king 4428 said 559-4 [unto him], Turn aside, 5437-3 [and] stand 3320-100 here. 3541 And he turned aside, 5437-11 and stood still. 5975-4

18:31 And, behold, Cushi 3569 came; 935-6 and Cushi 3569 said, 559-4 Tidings, 1319-101 my lord 113 the king: 4428 for the LORD 3068 hath avenged 8199-1 thee 3027 this day 3117 of all them that rose up 6965-5 against thee.

18:32 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto Cushi, 3569 Is the young man 5288 Absalom 53 safe? 7965 And Cushi 3569 answered, 559-4 The enemies 341-6 of my lord 113 the king, 4428 and all that rise 6965-1 against thee to do [thee] hurt, 7451 be as [that] young man 5288 [is].

18:33 And the king 4428 was much moved, 7264-4 and went up 5927-4 to the chamber 5944 over the gate, 8179 and wept: 1058-4 and as he went, 3212-2 thus he said, 559-1 O my son 1121 Absalom, 53 my son, 1121 my son 1121 Absalom! 53 would God 5414-4 I had died 4191-2 for thee, O Absalom, 53 my son, 1121 my son! 1121

19:1 And it was told 5046-93 Joab, 3097 Behold, the king 4428 weepeth 1058-6 and mourneth 56-101 for Absalom. 53

19:2 And the victory 8668 that day 3117 was [turned] into mourning 60 unto all the people: 5971 for the people 5971 heard 8085-1 say 559-2 that day 3117 how the king 4428 was grieved 6087-8 for his son. 1121

19:3 And the people 5971 gat 935-2 them by stealth 1589-101 that day 3117 into the city, 5892 as people 5971 being ashamed 3637-12 steal away 1589-101 when they flee 5127-2 in battle. 4421

19:4 But the king 4428 covered 3813-1 his face, 6440 and the king 4428 cried 2199-4 with a loud 1419 voice, 6963 O my son 1121 Absalom, 53 O Absalom, 53 my son, 1121 my son! 1121

19:5 And Joab 3097 came 935-4 into the house 1004 to the king, 4428 and said, 559-4 Thou hast shamed 3001-52 this day 3117 the faces 6440 of all thy servants, 5650 which this day 3117 have saved 4422-18 thy life, 5315 and the lives 5315 of thy sons 1121 and of thy daughters, 1323 and the lives 5315 of thy wives, 802 and the lives 5315 of thy concubines; 6370

19:6 In that thou lovest 157-2 thine enemies, 8130-6 and hatest 8130-2 thy friends. 157-6 For thou hast declared 5046-52 this day, 3117 that thou regardest neither princes 8269 nor servants: 5650 for this day 3117 I perceive, 3045-1 that if 3863 Absalom 53 had lived, 2416 and all we had died 4191-5 this day, 3117 then it had pleased 3477 5869 thee well.

19:7 Now therefore arise, 6965-3 go forth, 3318-3 and speak 1696-16 comfortably 3820 unto thy servants: 5650 for I swear 7650-8 by the LORD, 3068 if thou go not forth, 3318-6 there will not tarry 3885-4 one 376 with thee this night: 3915 and that will be worse 7489-1 unto thee than all the evil 7451 that befell 935-1 thee from thy youth 5271 until now.

19:8 Then the king 4428 arose, 6965-4 and sat 3427-4 in the gate. 8179 And they told 5046-52 unto all the people, 5971 saying, 559-2 Behold, the king 4428 doth sit 3427-6 in the gate. 8179 And all the people 5971 came 935-4 before 6440 the king: 4428 for Israel 3478 had fled 5127-1 every man 376 to his tent. 168

19:9 And all the people 5971 were at strife 1777-12 throughout all the tribes 7626 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 The king 4428 saved 5337-52 us out of the hand 3709 of our enemies, 341-6 and he delivered 4422-14 us out of the hand 3709 of the Philistines; 6430 and now he is fled 1272-1 out of the land 776 for Absalom. 53

19:10 And Absalom, 53 whom we anointed 4886-1 over us, is dead 4191-1 in battle. 4421 Now therefore why speak ye not a word 2790-56 of bringing the king 4428 back? 7725-53

19:11 And king 4428 David 1732 sent 7971-1 to Zadok 6659 and to Abiathar 54 the priests, 3548 saying, 559-2 Speak 1696-16 unto the elders 2205 of Judah, 3063 saying, 559-2 Why are ye the last 314 to bring the king 4428 back 7725-53 to his house? 1004 seeing the speech 1697 of all Israel 3478 is come 935-1 to the king, 4428 [even] to his house. 1004

19:12 Ye [are] my brethren, 251 ye [are] my bones 6106 and my flesh: 1320 wherefore then are ye the last 314 to bring back 7725-53 the king? 4428

19:13 And say 559-4 ye to Amasa, 6021 [Art] thou not of my bone, 6106 and of my flesh? 1320 God 430 do 6213-4 so to me, and more 3254-55 also, if thou be not captain 8269 of the host 6635 before 6440 me continually 3605 3117 in the room 8478 of Joab. 3097

19:14 And he bowed 5186-55 the heart 3824 of all the men 376 of Judah, 3063 even as [the heart of] one 259 man; 376 so that they sent 7971-4 [this word] unto the king, 4428 Return 7725-3 thou, and all thy servants. 5650

19:15 So the king 4428 returned, 7725-4 and came 935-4 to Jordan. 3383 And Judah 3063 came 935-1 to Gilgal, 1537 to go 3212-2 to meet 7125-2 the king, 4428 to conduct the king 4428 over 5674-53 Jordan. 3383

19:16 And Shimei 8096 the son 1121 of Gera, 1617 a Benjamite, 1145 which [was] of Bahurim, 980 hasted 4116-17 and came down 3381-4 with the men 376 of Judah 3063 to meet 7125-2 king 4428 David. 1732

19:17 And [there were] a thousand 505 men 376 of Benjamin 1144 with him, and Ziba 6717 the servant 5288 of the house 1004 of Saul, 7586 and his fifteen 2568 6240 sons 1121 and his twenty 6242 servants 5650 with him; and they went over 6743-1 Jordan 3383 before 6440 the king. 4428

19:18 And there went over 5674-1 a ferry boat 5679 to carry over 5674-53 the king's 4428 household, 1004 and to do 6213-2 what he thought 5869 good. 2896 And Shimei 8096 the son 1121 of Gera 1617 fell down 5307-1 before 6440 the king, 4428 as he was come over 5674-2 Jordan; 3383

19:19 And said 559-4 unto the king, 4428 Let not my lord 113 impute 2803-4 iniquity 5771 unto me, neither do thou remember 2142-4 that which thy servant 5650 did perversely 5753-52 the day 3117 that my lord 113 the king 4428 went out 3318-1 of Jerusalem, 3389 that the king 4428 should take 7760-2 it to his heart. 3820

19:20 For thy servant 5650 doth know 3045-1 that I have sinned: 2398-1 therefore, behold, I am come 935-1 the first 7223 this day 3117 of all the house 1004 of Joseph 3130 to go down 3381-2 to meet 7125-2 my lord 113 the king. 4428

19:21 But Abishai 52 the son 1121 of Zeruiah 6870 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 Shall not Shimei 8096 be put to death 4191-93 for this, because he cursed 7043-14 the LORD'S 3068 anointed? 4899

19:22 And David 1732 said, 559-4 What have I to do with you, ye sons 1121 of Zeruiah, 6870 that ye should this day 3117 be adversaries 7854 unto me? shall there any man 376 be put to death 4191-93 this day 3117 in Israel? 3478 for do not I know 3045-1 that I [am] this day 3117 king 4428 over Israel? 3478

19:23 Therefore the king 4428 said 559-4 unto Shimei, 8096 Thou shalt not die. 4191-4 And the king 4428 sware 7650-11 unto him.

19:24 And Mephibosheth 4648 the son 1121 of Saul 7586 came down 3381-1 to meet 7125-2 the king, 4428 and had neither 3808 dressed 6213-1 his feet, 7272 nor 3808 trimmed 6213-1 his beard, 8222 nor 3808 washed 3526-14 his clothes, 899 from the day 3117 the king 4428 departed 3212-2 until the day 3117 he came 935-1 [again] in peace. 7965

19:25 And it came to pass, when he was come 935-1 to Jerusalem 3389 to meet 7125-2 the king, 4428 that the king 4428 said 559-4 unto him, Wherefore wentest 1980-1 not thou with me, Mephibosheth? 4648

19:26 And he answered, 559-4 My lord, 113 O king, 4428 my servant 5650 deceived 7411-14 me: for thy servant 5650 said, 559-1 I will saddle 2280-4 me an ass, 2543 that I may ride 7392-4 thereon, and go 3212-4 to the king; 4428 because thy servant 5650 [is] lame. 6455

19:27 And he hath slandered 7270-17 thy servant 5650 unto my lord 113 the king; 4428 but my lord 113 the king 4428 [is] as an angel 4397 of God: 430 do 6213-3 therefore [what is] good 2896 in thine eyes. 5869

19:28 For all [of] my father's 1 house 1004 were but 3808 dead 4194 men 582 before my lord 113 the king: 4428 yet didst thou set 7896-4 thy servant 5650 among them that did eat 398-6 at thine own table. 7979 What right 6666 therefore have 3426 I yet to cry 2199-2 any more unto the king? 4428

19:29 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto him, Why speakest 1696-17 thou any more of thy matters? 1697 I have said, 559-1 Thou and Ziba 6717 divide 2505-4 the land. 7704

19:30 And Mephibosheth 4648 said 559-4 unto the king, 4428 Yea, let him take 3947-4 all, forasmuch 310 as 834 my lord 113 the king 4428 is come 935-1 again in peace 7965 unto his own house. 1004

19:31 And Barzillai 1271 the Gileadite 1569 came down 3381-1 from Rogelim, 7274 and went over 5674-4 Jordan 3383 with the king, 4428 to conduct 7971-15 him over Jordan. 3383

19:32 Now Barzillai 1271 was a very 3966 aged 2204-1 man, [even] fourscore 8084 years 8141 old: 1121 and he had provided the king 4428 of sustenance 3557-43 while he lay 7871 at Mahanaim; 4266 for he [was] a very 3966 great 1419 man. 376

19:33 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto Barzillai, 1271 Come thou over 5674-3 with me, and I will feed 3557-43 thee with me in Jerusalem. 3389

19:34 And Barzillai 1271 said 559-4 unto the king, 4428 How long 3117 have I to live, 8141 2416 that I should go up 5927-4 with the king 4428 unto Jerusalem? 3389

19:35 I [am] this day 3117 fourscore 8084 years 8141 old: 1121 [and] can I discern 3045-4 between good 2896 and evil? 7451 can thy servant 5650 taste 2938-4 what 834 I eat 398-4 or what 834 I drink? 8354-4 can I hear 8085-4 any more the voice 6963 of singing 7891-6 men and singing 7891-6 women? wherefore then should thy servant 5650 be yet a burden 4853 unto my lord 113 the king? 4428

19:36 Thy servant 5650 will go a little 4592 way over 5674-4 Jordan 3383 with the king: 4428 and why should the king 4428 recompense 1580-4 it me with such a reward? 1578

19:37 Let thy servant, 5650 I pray thee, turn back again, 7725-4 that I may die 4191-4 in mine own city, 5892 [and be buried] by the grave 6913 of my father 1 and of my mother. 517 But behold thy servant 5650 Chimham; 3643 let him go over 5674-4 with my lord 113 the king; 4428 and do 6213-3 to him what shall seem good 2896 5869 unto thee.

19:38 And the king 4428 answered, 559-4 Chimham 3643 shall go over 5674-4 with me, and I will do 6213-4 to him that which shall seem good 2896 5869 unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require 977-4 of me, [that] will I do 6213-4 for thee.

19:39 And all the people 5971 went over 5674-4 Jordan. 3383 And when the king 4428 was come over, 5674-1 the king 4428 kissed 5401-4 Barzillai, 1271 and blessed 1288-17 him; and he returned 7725-4 unto his own place. 4725

19:40 Then the king 4428 went on 5674-4 to Gilgal, 1537 and Chimham 3643 went on 5674-1 with him: and all the people 5971 of Judah 3063 conducted 5674-52|5674-55-k the king, 4428 and also half 2677 the people 5971 of Israel. 3478

19:41 And, behold, all the men 376 of Israel 3478 came 935-6 to the king, 4428 and said 559-4 unto the king, 4428 Why have our brethren 251 the men 376 of Judah 3063 stolen thee away, 1589-1 and have brought 5674-55 the king, 4428 and his household, 1004 and all David's 1732 men 582 with him, over Jordan? 3383

19:42 And all the men 376 of Judah 3063 answered 6030-4 the men 376 of Israel, 3478 Because the king 4428 [is] near of kin 7138 to us: wherefore then be ye angry 2734-1 for this matter? 1697 have we eaten 398-1 at all 398-2 of the king's 4428 [cost]? or hath he given 5375-14 us any gift? 5379

19:43 And the men 376 of Israel 3478 answered 6030-4 the men 376 of Judah, 3063 and said, 559-4 We have ten 6235 parts 3027 in the king, 4428 and we 589 have also more [right] in David 1732 than ye: why then did ye despise 7043-52 us, that our advice 1697 should not be first 7223 had in bringing back 7725-53 our king? 4428 And the words 1697 of the men 376 of Judah 3063 were fiercer 7185-4 than the words 1697 of the men 376 of Israel. 3478

20:1 And there happened 7122-8 to be there a man 376 of Belial, 1100 whose name 8034 [was] Sheba, 7652 the son 1121 of Bichri, 1075 a Benjamite: 376 3228 and he blew 8628-4 a trumpet, 7782 and said, 559-4 We have no part 2506 in David, 1732 neither have we inheritance 5159 in the son 1121 of Jesse: 3448 every man 376 to his tents, 168 O Israel. 3478

20:2 So every man 376 of Israel 3478 went up 5927-4 from after 310 David, 1732 [and] followed 310 Sheba 7652 the son 1121 of Bichri: 1075 but the men 376 of Judah 3063 clave 1692-1 unto their king, 4428 from Jordan 3383 even to Jerusalem. 3389

20:3 And David 1732 came 935-4 to his house 1004 at Jerusalem; 3389 and the king 4428 took 3947-4 the ten 6235 women 802 [his] concubines, 6370 whom he had left 3240-52 to keep 8104-2 the house, 1004 and put 5414-4 them in ward, 4931 and fed 3557-46 them, but went 935-1 not in unto them. So they were shut up 6887-7 unto the day 3117 of their death, 4191-2 living 2424 in widowhood. 491

20:4 Then said 559-4 the king 4428 to Amasa, 6021 Assemble 2199-54 me the men 376 of Judah 3063 within three 7969 days, 3117 and be thou here present. 5975-3

20:5 So Amasa 6021 went 3212-4 to assemble 2199-53 [the men of] Judah: 3063 but he tarried longer 309-4|3186-4-k than the set time 4150 which he had appointed 3259-1 him.

20:6 And David 1732 said 559-4 to Abishai, 52 Now shall Sheba 7652 the son 1121 of Bichri 1075 do us more harm 3415-4 than [did] Absalom: 53 take 3947-3 thou thy lord's 113 servants, 5650 and pursue 7291-3 after 310 him, lest he get 4672-1 him fenced 1219-7 cities, 5892 and escape 5337-52 us. 5869

20:7 And there went out 3318-4 after 310 him Joab's 3097 men, 582 and the Cherethites, 3774 and the Pelethites, 6432 and all the mighty men: 1368 and they went out 3318-4 of Jerusalem, 3389 to pursue 7291-2 after 310 Sheba 7652 the son 1121 of Bichri. 1075

20:8 When they [were] at the great 1419 stone 68 which [is] in Gibeon, 1391 Amasa 6021 went 935-1 before 6440 them. And Joab's 3097 garment 4055 that he had put on 3830 was girded 2296-7 unto him, and upon it a girdle 2289 [with] a sword 2719 fastened 6775-30 upon his loins 4975 in the sheath 8593 thereof; and as he went forth 3318-1 it fell 5307-4 out.

20:9 And Joab 3097 said 559-4 to Amasa, 6021 [Art] thou in health, 7965 my brother? 251 And Joab 3097 took 270-4 Amasa 6021 by the beard 2206 with the right 3225 hand 3027 to kiss 5401-2 him.

20:10 But Amasa 6021 took no heed 8104-8 to the sword 2719 that [was] in Joab's 3097 hand: 3027 so he smote 5221-55 him therewith in the fifth 2570 [rib], and shed out 8210-4 his bowels 4578 to the ground, 776 and struck him not again; 8138-1 and he died. 4191-4 So Joab 3097 and Abishai 52 his brother 251 pursued 7291-1 after 310 Sheba 7652 the son 1121 of Bichri. 1075

20:11 And one 376 of Joab's 3097 men 5288 stood 5975-1 by him, and said, 559-4 He 4310 that favoureth 2654-1 Joab, 3097 and he 4310 that [is] for David, 1732 [let him go] after 310 Joab. 3097

20:12 And Amasa 6021 wallowed 1556-109 in blood 1818 in the midst 8432 of the highway. 4546 And when the man 376 saw 7200-4 that all the people 5971 stood still, 5975-1 he removed 5437-55 Amasa 6021 out of the highway 4546 into the field, 7704 and cast 7993-55 a cloth 899 upon him, when he saw 7200-1 that every one that came 935-6 by him stood still. 5975-1

20:13 When he was removed 3014-52 out of the highway, 4546 all the people 376 went on 5674-1 after 310 Joab, 3097 to pursue 7291-2 after 310 Sheba 7652 the son 1121 of Bichri. 1075

20:14 And he went through 5674-4 all the tribes 7626 of Israel 3478 unto Abel, 59 and to Bethmaachah, 1038 and all the Berites: 1276 and they were gathered together, 6950-11|7035-11-k and went 935-4 also after 310 him.

20:15 And they came 935-4 and besieged 6696-4 him in Abel 59 of Bethmaachah, 1038 and they cast up 8210-4 a bank 5550 against the city, 5892 and it stood 5975-4 in the trench: 2426 and all the people 5971 that [were] with Joab 3097 battered 7843-56 the wall, 2346 to throw it down. 5307-53

20:16 Then cried 7121-4 a wise 2450 woman 802 out of the city, 5892 Hear, 8085-3 hear; 8085-3 say, 559-3 I pray you, unto Joab, 3097 Come near 7126-3 hither, that I may speak 1696-17 with thee.

20:17 And when he was come near 7126-4 unto her, the woman 802 said, 559-4 [Art] thou Joab? 3097 And he answered, 559-4 I [am he]. Then she said 559-4 unto him, Hear 8085-3 the words 1697 of thine handmaid. 519 And he answered, 559-4 I do hear. 8085-6

20:18 Then she spake, 559-4 saying, 559-2 They were wont 1696-15 to speak 1696-17 in old time, 7223 saying, 559-2 They shall surely 7592-2 ask 7592-17 [counsel] at Abel: 59 and so they ended 8552-52 [the matter].

20:19 I [am one of them that are] peaceable 7999-7 [and] faithful 539-7 in Israel: 3478 thou seekest 1245-18 to destroy 4191-53 a city 5892 and a mother 517 in Israel: 3478 why wilt thou swallow up 1104-17 the inheritance 5159 of the LORD? 3068

20:20 And Joab 3097 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 Far be it, 2486 far be it 2486 from me, that I should swallow up 1104-17 or destroy. 7843-55

20:21 The matter 1697 [is] not so: but a man 376 of mount 2022 Ephraim, 669 Sheba 7652 the son 1121 of Bichri 1075 by name, 8034 hath lifted up 5375-1 his hand 3027 against the king, 4428 [even] against David: 1732 deliver 5414-3 him only, and I will depart 3212-4 from the city. 5892 And the woman 802 said 559-4 unto Joab, 3097 Behold, his head 7218 shall be thrown 7993-94 to thee over 1157 the wall. 2346

20:22 Then the woman 802 went 935-4 unto all the people 5971 in her wisdom. 2451 And they cut off 3772-4 the head 7218 of Sheba 7652 the son 1121 of Bichri, 1075 and cast 7993-55 [it] out to Joab. 3097 And he blew 8628-4 a trumpet, 7782 and they retired 6327-4 from the city, 5892 every man 376 to his tent. 168 And Joab 3097 returned 7725-1 to Jerusalem 3389 unto the king. 4428

20:23 Now Joab 3097 [was] over all the host 6635 of Israel: 3478 and Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada 3077 [was] over the Cherethites 3774|3746-k and over the Pelethites: 6432

20:24 And Adoram 151 [was] over the tribute: 4522 and Jehoshaphat 3092 the son 1121 of Ahilud 286 [was] recorder: 2142-56

20:25 And Sheva 7864|7724-k [was] scribe: 5608-6 and Zadok 6659 and Abiathar 54 [were] the priests: 3548

20:26 And Ira 5896 also the Jairite 2972 was a chief ruler 3548 about David. 1732

21:1 Then there was a famine 7458 in the days 3117 of David 1732 three 7969 years, 8141 year 8141 after 310 year; 8141 and David 1732 enquired 1245-17 of 6440 the LORD. 3068 And the LORD 3068 answered, 559-4 [It is] for Saul, 7586 and for [his] bloody 1818 house, 1004 because he slew 4191-52 the Gibeonites. 1393

21:2 And the king 4428 called 7121-4 the Gibeonites, 1393 and said 559-4 unto them; (now the Gibeonites 1393 [were] not of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 but of the remnant 3499 of the Amorites; 567 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 had sworn 7650-8 unto them: and Saul 7586 sought 1245-17 to slay 5221-53 them in his zeal 7065-15 to the children 1121 of Israel 3478 and Judah.) 3063

21:3 Wherefore David 1732 said 559-4 unto the Gibeonites, 1393 What shall I do 6213-4 for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, 3722-17 that ye may bless 1288-16 the inheritance 5159 of the LORD? 3068

21:4 And the Gibeonites 1393 said 559-4 unto him, We will have no silver 3701 nor gold 2091 of 5973 Saul, 7586 nor of his house; 1004 neither for us shalt thou kill 4191-53 any man 376 in Israel. 3478 And he said, 559-4 What ye shall say, 559-6 [that] will I do 6213-4 for you.

21:5 And they answered 559-4 the king, 4428 The man 376 that consumed 3615-14 us, and that devised 1819-14 against us [that] we should be destroyed 8045-8 from remaining 3320-99 in any of the coasts 1366 of Israel, 3478

21:6 Let seven 7651 men 582 of his sons 1121 be delivered 5414-93 unto us, and we will hang them up 3363-52 unto the LORD 3068 in Gibeah 1390 of Saul, 7586 [whom] the LORD 3068 did choose. 972 And the king 4428 said, 559-4 I will give 5414-4 [them].

21:7 But the king 4428 spared 2550-4 Mephibosheth, 4648 the son 1121 of Jonathan 3083 the son 1121 of Saul, 7586 because of the LORD'S 3068 oath 7621 that [was] between them, between David 1732 and Jonathan 3083 the son 1121 of Saul. 7586

21:8 But the king 4428 took 3947-4 the two 8147 sons 1121 of Rizpah 7532 the daughter 1323 of Aiah, 345 whom she bare 3205-1 unto Saul, 7586 Armoni 764 and Mephibosheth; 4648 and the five 2568 sons 1121 of Michal 4324 the daughter 1323 of Saul, 7586 whom she brought up 3205-1 for Adriel 5741 the son 1121 of Barzillai 1271 the Meholathite: 4259

21:9 And he delivered 5414-4 them into the hands 3027 of the Gibeonites, 1393 and they hanged 3363-55 them in the hill 2022 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 and they fell 5307-4 [all] seven 7651|7659-k together, 3162 and were put to death 4191-90 in the days 3117 of harvest, 7105 in the first 7223 [days], in the beginning 8462 of barley 8184 harvest. 7105

21:10 And Rizpah 7532 the daughter 1323 of Aiah 345 took 3947-4 sackcloth, 8242 and spread 5186-55 it for her upon the rock, 6697 from the beginning 8462 of harvest 7105 until water 4325 dropped 5413-8 upon them out of heaven, 8064 and suffered 5414-1 neither the birds 5775 of the air 8064 to rest 5117-2 on them by day, 3119 nor the beasts 2416 of the field 7704 by night. 3915

21:11 And it was told 5046-93 David 1732 what Rizpah 7532 the daughter 1323 of Aiah, 345 the concubine 6370 of Saul, 7586 had done. 6213-1

21:12 And David 1732 went 3212-4 and took 3947-4 the bones 6106 of Saul 7586 and the bones 6106 of Jonathan 3083 his son 1121 from the men 1167 of Jabeshgilead, 3003 1568 which had stolen 1589-1 them from the street 7339 of Bethshan, 1052 where the Philistines 6430 had hanged 8511-1|8518-1-k them, when 3117 the Philistines 6430 had slain 5221-53 Saul 7586 in Gilboa: 1533

21:13 And he brought up 5927-55 from thence the bones 6106 of Saul 7586 and the bones 6106 of Jonathan 3083 his son; 1121 and they gathered 622-4 the bones 6106 of them that were hanged. 3363-94

21:14 And the bones 6106 of Saul 7586 and Jonathan 3083 his son 1121 buried 6912-4 they in the country 776 of Benjamin 1144 in Zelah, 6762 in the sepulchre 6913 of Kish 7027 his father: 1 and they performed 6213-4 all that the king 4428 commanded. 6680-14 And after 310 that God 430 was intreated 6279-11 for the land. 776

21:15 Moreover the Philistines 6430 had yet war 4421 again with Israel; 3478 and David 1732 went down, 3381-4 and his servants 5650 with him, and fought 3898-11 against the Philistines: 6430 and David 1732 waxed faint. 5774-4

21:16 And Ishbibenob, 3430 which [was] of the sons 3211 of the giant, 7498 the weight 4948 of whose spear 7013 [weighed] three 7969 hundred 3967 [shekels] of brass 5178 in weight, 4948 he being girded 2296-7 with a new 2319 [sword], thought 559-4 to have slain 5221-53 David. 1732

21:17 But Abishai 52 the son 1121 of Zeruiah 6870 succoured 5826-4 him, and smote 5221-55 the Philistine, 6430 and killed 4191-55 him. Then the men 582 of David 1732 sware 7650-8 unto him, saying, 559-2 Thou shalt go no more out 3318-4 with us to battle, 4421 that thou quench 3518-17 not the light 5216 of Israel. 3478

21:18 And it came to pass after 310 this, that there was again a battle 4421 with the Philistines 6430 at Gob: 1359 then Sibbechai 5444 the Hushathite 2843 slew 5221-52 Saph, 5593 which [was] of the sons 3211 of the giant. 7498

21:19 And there was again a battle 4421 in Gob 1359 with the Philistines, 6430 where Elhanan 445 the son 1121 of Jaareoregim, 3296 a Bethlehemite, 1022 slew 5221-55 [the brother of] Goliath 1555 the Gittite, 1663 the staff 6086 of whose spear 2595 [was] like a weaver's 707-6 beam. 4500

21:20 And there was yet a battle 4421 in Gath, 1661 where was a man 376 of [great] stature, 4067|4055-k that had on every hand 3027 six 8337 fingers, 676 and on every foot 7272 six 8337 toes, 676 four 702 and twenty 6242 in number; 4557 and he also was born 3205-27 to the giant. 7498

21:21 And when he defied 2778-17 Israel, 3478 Jonathan 3083 the son 1121 of Shimea 8092 the brother 251 of David 1732 slew 5221-55 him.

21:22 These four 702 were born 3205-27 to the giant 7498 in Gath, 1661 and fell 5307-4 by the hand 3027 of David, 1732 and by the hand 3027 of his servants. 5650

22:1 And David 1732 spake 1696-17 unto the LORD 3068 the words 1697 of this song 7892 in the day 3117 [that] the LORD 3068 had delivered 5337-52 him out of the hand 3709 of all his enemies, 341-6 and out of the hand 3709 of Saul: 7586

22:2 And he said, 559-4 The LORD 3068 [is] my rock, 5553 and my fortress, 4686 and my deliverer; 6403-18

22:3 The God 430 of my rock; 6697 in him will I trust: 2620-4 [he is] my shield, 4043 and the horn 7161 of my salvation, 3468 my high tower, 4869 and my refuge, 4498 my saviour; 3467-56 thou savest 3467-55 me from violence. 2555

22:4 I will call 7121-4 on the LORD, 3068 [who is] worthy to be praised: 1984-30 so shall I be saved 3467-11 from mine enemies. 341-6

22:5 When the waves 4867 of death 4194 compassed 661-1 me, the floods 5158 of ungodly men 1100 made me afraid; 1204-17

22:6 The sorrows 2256 of hell 7585 compassed me about; 5437-1 the snares 4170 of death 4194 prevented 6923-14 me;

22:7 In my distress 6862 I called 7121-4 upon the LORD, 3068 and cried 7121-4 to my God: 430 and he did hear 8085-4 my voice 6963 out of his temple, 1964 and my cry 7775 [did enter] into his ears. 241

22:8 Then the earth 776 shook 1607-101|1607-4-k and trembled; 7493-4 the foundations 4146 of heaven 8064 moved 7264-4 and shook, 1607-101 because he was wroth. 2734-1

22:9 There went up 5927-1 a smoke 6227 out of his nostrils, 639 and fire 784 out of his mouth 6310 devoured: 398-4 coals 1513 were kindled 1197-1 by it.

22:10 He bowed 5186-4 the heavens 8064 also, and came down; 3381-4 and darkness 6205 [was] under his feet. 7272

22:11 And he rode 7392-4 upon a cherub, 3742 and did fly: 5774-4 and he was seen 7200-11 upon the wings 3671 of the wind. 7307

22:12 And he made 7896-4 darkness 2822 pavilions 5521 round about 5439 him, dark 2841 waters, 4325 [and] thick clouds 5645 of the skies. 7834

22:13 Through the brightness 5051 before him were coals 1513 of fire 784 kindled. 1197-1

22:14 The LORD 3068 thundered 7481-55 from heaven, 8064 and the most High 5945 uttered 5414-4 his voice. 6963

22:15 And he sent out 7971-4 arrows, 2671 and scattered 6327-55 them; lightning, 1300 and discomfited 2000-4 them.

22:16 And the channels 650 of the sea 3220 appeared, 7200-11 the foundations 4146 of the world 8398 were discovered, 1540-11 at the rebuking 1606 of the LORD, 3068 at the blast 5397 of the breath 7307 of his nostrils. 639

22:17 He sent 7971-4 from above, 4791 he took 3947-4 me; he drew 4871-55 me out of many 7227 waters; 4325

22:18 He delivered 5337-55 me from my strong 5794 enemy, 341-6 [and] from them that hated 8130-6 me: for they were too strong 553-1 for me.

22:19 They prevented 6923-17 me in the day 3117 of my calamity: 343 but the LORD 3068 was my stay. 4937

22:20 He brought me forth 3318-55 also into a large place: 4800 he delivered 2502-17 me, because he delighted 2654-1 in me.

22:21 The LORD 3068 rewarded 1580-4 me according to my righteousness: 6666 according to the cleanness 1252 of my hands 3027 hath he recompensed 7725-55 me.

22:22 For I have kept 8104-1 the ways 1870 of the LORD, 3068 and have not wickedly departed 7561-1 from my God. 430

22:23 For all his judgments 4941 [were] before me: and [as for] his statutes, 2708 I did not depart 5493-4 from them.

22:24 I was also upright 8549 before him, and have kept 8104-101 myself from mine iniquity. 5771

22:25 Therefore the LORD 3068 hath recompensed 7725-55 me according to my righteousness; 6666 according to my cleanness 1252 in 5048 his eye sight. 5869

22:26 With the merciful 2623 thou wilt shew thyself merciful, 2616-101 [and] with the upright 8549 man 1368 thou wilt shew thyself upright. 8552-101

22:27 With the pure 1305-12 thou wilt shew thyself pure; 1305-101 and with the froward 6141 thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury. 6617-101

22:28 And the afflicted 6041 people 5971 thou wilt save: 3467-55 but thine eyes 5869 [are] upon the haughty, 7311-6 [that] thou mayest bring [them] down. 8213-55

22:29 For thou [art] my lamp, 5216 O LORD: 3068 and the LORD 3068 will lighten 5050-55 my darkness. 2822

22:30 For by thee I have run 7323-4 through a troop: 1416 by my God 430 have I leaped 1801-17 over a wall. 7791

22:31 [As for] God, 410 his way 1870 [is] perfect; 8549 the word 565 of the LORD 3068 [is] tried: 6884-7 he [is] a buckler 4043 to all them that trust 2620-6 in him.

22:32 For who [is] God, 410 save 1107 the LORD? 3068 and who [is] a rock, 6697 save 1107 our God? 430

22:33 God 410 [is] my strength 4581 [and] power: 2428 and he maketh 5425-55 my way 1870 perfect. 8549

22:34 He maketh my feet 7272 like 7737-18 hinds' 355 [feet]: and setteth 5975-55 me upon my high places. 1116

22:35 He teacheth 3925-18 my hands 3027 to war; 4421 so that a bow 7198 of steel 5154 is broken 5181-14 by mine arms. 2220

22:36 Thou hast also given 5414-4 me the shield 4043 of thy salvation: 3468 and thy gentleness 6031-2|6038 hath made me great. 7235-55

22:37 Thou hast enlarged 7337-55 my steps 6806 under me; so that my feet 7166 did not slip. 4571-1

22:38 I have pursued 7291-4 mine enemies, 341-6 and destroyed 8045-55 them; and turned not again 7725-4 until I had consumed 3615-15 them.

22:39 And I have consumed 3615-17 them, and wounded 4272-4 them, that they could not arise: 6965-4 yea, they are fallen 5307-4 under my feet. 7272

22:40 For thou hast girded 247-17 me with strength 2428 to battle: 4421 them that rose up 6965-5 against me hast thou subdued 3766-55 under me.

22:41 Thou hast also given 5414-1 me the necks 6203 of mine enemies, 341-6 that I might destroy 6789-55 them that hate 8130-18 me.

22:42 They looked, 8159-4 but [there was] none to save; 3467-56 [even] unto the LORD, 3068 but he answered 6030-1 them not.

22:43 Then did I beat 7833-4 them as small as the dust 6083 of the earth, 776 I did stamp 1854-55 them as the mire 2916 of the street, 2351 [and] did spread them abroad. 7554-4

22:44 Thou also hast delivered 6403-17 me from the strivings 7379 of my people, 5971 thou hast kept 8104-4 me [to be] head 7218 of the heathen: 1471 a people 5971 [which] I knew 3045-1 not shall serve 5647-4 me.

22:45 Strangers 1121 5236 shall submit 3584-101 themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, 8085-2 241 they shall be obedient 8085-11 unto me.

22:46 Strangers 1121 5236 shall fade away, 5034-4 and they shall be afraid 2296-4 out of their close places. 4526

22:47 The LORD 3068 liveth; 2416 and blessed 1288-7 [be] my rock; 6697 and exalted 7311-4 be the God 430 of the rock 6697 of my salvation. 3468

22:48 It [is] God 410 that avengeth 5414-6 5360 me, and that bringeth down 3381-56 the people 5971 under me,

22:49 And that bringeth me forth 3318-56 from mine enemies: 341-6 thou also hast lifted me up on high 7311-34 above them that rose up 6965-5 against me: thou hast delivered 5337-55 me from the violent 2555 man. 376

22:50 Therefore I will give thanks 3034-55 unto thee, O LORD, 3068 among the heathen, 1471 and I will sing praises 2167-17 unto thy name. 8034

22:51 [He is] the tower 4024|1431-56-k of salvation 3444 for his king: 4428 and sheweth 6213-6 mercy 2617 to his anointed, 4899 unto David, 1732 and to his seed 2233 for 5704 evermore. 5769

23:1 Now these [be] the last 314 words 1697 of David. 1732 David 1732 the son 1121 of Jesse 3448 said, 5002-7 and the man 1397 [who was] raised up 6965-90 on high, 5920 the anointed 4899 of the God 430 of Jacob, 3290 and the sweet 5273 psalmist 2158 of Israel, 3478 said, 5002-7

23:2 The Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 spake 1696-14 by me, and his word 4405 [was] in my tongue. 3956

23:3 The God 430 of Israel 3478 said, 559-1 the Rock 6697 of Israel 3478 spake 1696-14 to me, He that ruleth 4910-6 over men 120 [must be] just, 6662 ruling 4910-6 in the fear 3374 of God. 430

23:4 And [he shall be] as the light 216 of the morning, 1242 [when] the sun 8121 riseth, 2224-4 [even] a morning 1242 without 3808 clouds; 5645 [as] the tender grass 1877 [springing] out of the earth 776 by clear shining 5051 after rain. 4306

23:5 Although my house 1004 [be] not so with God; 410 yet he hath made 7760-1 with me an everlasting 5769 covenant, 1285 ordered 6186-7 in all [things], and sure: 8104-7 for [this is] all my salvation, 3468 and all [my] desire, 2656 although he make [it] not to grow. 6779-55

23:6 But [the sons] of Belial 1100 [shall be] all of them as thorns 6975 thrust away, 5074-94 because they cannot be taken 3947-4 with hands: 3027

23:7 But the man 376 [that] shall touch 5060-4 them must be fenced 4390-11 with iron 1270 and the staff 6086 of a spear; 2595 and they shall be utterly 8313-2 burned 8313-11 with fire 784 in the [same] place. 7675-2

23:8 These [be] the names 8034 of the mighty men 1368 whom David 1732 had: The Tachmonite 8461 that sat in the seat, 3427-6|7674|3429 chief 7218 among the captains; 7991 the same [was] Adino 5722 the Eznite: 6112 [he lift up his spear] against eight 8083 hundred, 3967 whom he slew 2491 at one 259 time. 6471

23:9 And after 310 him [was] Eleazar 499 the son 1121 of Dodo 1734 the Ahohite, 1121 266 [one] of the three 7969 mighty men 1368 with David, 1732 when they defied 2778-15 the Philistines 6430 [that] were there gathered 622-8 together to battle, 4421 and the men 376 of Israel 3478 were gone away: 5927-4

23:10 He arose, 6965-1 and smote 5221-55 the Philistines 6430 until 3588 his hand 3027 was weary, 3021-1 and his hand 3027 clave 1692-4 unto the sword: 2719 and the LORD 3068 wrought 6213-4 a great 1419 victory 8668 that day; 3117 and the people 5971 returned 7725-4 after 310 him only to spoil. 6584-15

23:11 And after 310 him [was] Shammah 8048 the son 1121 of Agee 89 the Hararite. 2043 And the Philistines 6430 were gathered 622-11 together into a troop, 2416 where was a piece 2513 of ground 7704 full 4392 of lentiles: 5742 and the people 5971 fled 5127-1 from 6440 the Philistines. 6430

23:12 But he stood 3320-101 in the midst 8432 of the ground, 2513 and defended 5337-55 it, and slew 5221-55 the Philistines: 6430 and the LORD 3068 wrought 6213-4 a great 1419 victory. 8668

23:13 And three 7969|7970-k of the thirty 7970 chief 7218 went down, 3381-4 and came 935-4 to David 1732 in the harvest 7105 time unto the cave 4631 of Adullam: 5725 and the troop 2416 of the Philistines 6430 pitched 2583-6 in the valley 6010 of Rephaim. 7497

23:14 And David 1732 [was] then in an hold, 4686 and the garrison 4673 of the Philistines 6430 [was] then [in] Bethlehem. 1035

23:15 And David 1732 longed, 183-101 and said, 559-4 Oh that one would give me drink 8248-55 of the water 4325 of the well 953 of Bethlehem, 1035 which [is] by the gate! 8179

23:16 And the three 7969 mighty men 1368 brake through 1234-4 the host 4264 of the Philistines, 6430 and drew 7579-4 water 4325 out of the well 953 of Bethlehem, 1035 that [was] by the gate, 8179 and took 5375-4 [it], and brought 935-55 [it] to David: 1732 nevertheless he would 14-1 not drink 8354-2 thereof, but poured it out 5258-55 unto the LORD. 3068

23:17 And he said, 559-4 Be it far 2486 from me, O LORD, 3068 that I should do 6213-2 this: [is not this] the blood 1818 of the men 582 that went 1980-6 in jeopardy of their lives? 5315 therefore he would 14-1 not drink 8354-2 it. These things did 6213-1 these three 7969 mighty men. 1368

23:18 And Abishai, 52 the brother 251 of Joab, 3097 the son 1121 of Zeruiah, 6870 was chief 7218 among three. 7969|7992-k And he lifted up 5782-31 his spear 2595 against three 7969 hundred, 3967 [and] slew 2491 [them], and had the name 8034 among three. 7969

23:19 Was he not most honourable 3513-12 of three? 7969 therefore he was their captain: 8269 howbeit he attained 935-1 not unto the [first] three. 7969

23:20 And Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada, 3077 the son 1121 of a valiant 2428 man, 376 of Kabzeel, 6909 who had done many 7227 acts, 6467 he slew 5221-52 two 8147 lionlike men 739 of Moab: 4124 he went down 3381-1 also and slew 5221-52 a lion 738 in the midst 8432 of a pit 953 in time 3117 of snow: 7950

23:21 And he slew 5221-52 an Egyptian, 4713 376-q a goodly 4758 man: 376 and the Egyptian 4713 had a spear 2595 in his hand; 3027 but he went down 3381-4 to him with a staff, 7626 and plucked 1497-4 the spear 2595 out of the Egyptian's 4713 hand, 3027 and slew 2026-4 him with his own spear. 2595

23:22 These [things] did 6213-1 Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada, 3077 and had the name 8034 among three 7969 mighty men. 1368

23:23 He was more honourable 3513-12 than the thirty, 7970 but he attained 935-1 not to the [first] three. 7969 And David 1732 set 7760-4 him over his guard. 4928

23:24 Asahel 6214 the brother 251 of Joab 3097 [was] one of the thirty; 7970 Elhanan 445 the son 1121 of Dodo 1734 of Bethlehem, 1035

23:39 Uriah 223 the Hittite: 2850 thirty 7970 and seven 7651 in all.

24:1 And again 3254-55 the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 was kindled 2734-2 against Israel, 3478 and he moved 5496-55 David 1732 against them to say, 559-2 Go, 3212-3 number 4487-3 Israel 3478 and Judah. 3063

24:2 For the king 4428 said 559-4 to Joab 3097 the captain 8269 of the host, 2428 which [was] with him, Go now through 7751-3 all the tribes 7626 of Israel, 3478 from Dan 1835 even to Beersheba, 884 and number 6485-3 ye the people, 5971 that I may know 3045-1 the number 4557 of the people. 5971

24:3 And Joab 3097 said 559-4 unto the king, 4428 Now the LORD 3068 thy God 430 add 3254-55 unto the people, 5971 how many soever 1992 they be, an hundredfold, 3967 6471 and that the eyes 5869 of my lord 113 the king 4428 may see 7200-6 [it]: but why doth my lord 113 the king 4428 delight 2654-1 in this thing? 1697

24:4 Notwithstanding the king's 4428 word 1697 prevailed 2388-4 against Joab, 3097 and against the captains 8269 of the host. 2428 And Joab 3097 and the captains 8269 of the host 2428 went out 3318-4 from the presence 6440 of the king, 4428 to number 6485-2 the people 5971 of Israel. 3478

24:5 And they passed over 5674-4 Jordan, 3383 and pitched 2583-4 in Aroer, 6177 on the right side 3225 of the city 5892 that [lieth] in the midst 8432 of the river 5158 of Gad, 1410 and toward Jazer: 3270

24:6 Then they came 935-4 to Gilead, 1568 and to the land 776 of Tahtimhodshi; 8483 and they came 935-4 to Danjaan, 1842 and about 5439 to Zidon, 6721

24:7 And came 935-4 to the strong hold 4013 of Tyre, 6865 and to all the cities 5892 of the Hivites, 2340 and of the Canaanites: 3669 and they went out 3318-4 to the south 5045 of Judah, 3063 [even] to Beersheba. 884

24:8 So when they had gone 7751-4 through all the land, 776 they came 935-4 to Jerusalem 3389 at the end 7097 of nine 8672 months 2320 and twenty 6242 days. 3117

24:9 And Joab 3097 gave up 5414-4 the sum 4557 of the number 4662 of the people 5971 unto the king: 4428 and there were in Israel 3478 eight 8083 hundred 3967 thousand 505 valiant 2428 men 376 that drew 8025-6 the sword; 2719 and the men 376 of Judah 3063 [were] five 2568 hundred 3967 thousand 505 men. 376

24:10 And David's 1732 heart 3820 smote 5221-55 him after 310 that he had numbered 5608-1 the people. 5971 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto the LORD, 3068 I have sinned 2398-1 greatly 3966 in that I have done: 6213-1 and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, 3068 take away 5674-54 the iniquity 5771 of thy servant; 5650 for I have done very 3966 foolishly. 5528-8

24:11 For when David 1732 was up 6965-4 in the morning, 1242 the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto the prophet 5030 Gad, 1410 David's 1732 seer, 2374 saying, 559-2

24:12 Go 1980-2 and say 1696-14 unto David, 1732 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 I offer 5190-6 thee three 7969 [things]; choose 977-3 thee one 259 of them, that I may 6213-4 [do it] unto thee.

24:13 So Gad 1410 came 935-4 to David, 1732 and told 5046-55 him, and said 559-4 unto him, Shall seven 7651 years 8141 of famine 7458 come 935-4 unto thee in thy land? 776 or wilt thou flee 5127-2 three 7969 months 2320 before 6440 thine enemies, 6862 while they pursue 7291-6 thee? or that there be three 7969 days' 3117 pestilence 1698 in thy land? 776 now advise, 3045-3 and see 7200-3 what answer 1697 I shall return 7725-55 to him that sent 7971-6 me.

24:14 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto Gad, 1410 I am in a great 3966 strait: 6887-1 let us fall 5307-4 now into the hand 3027 of the LORD; 3068 for his mercies 7356 [are] great: 7227 and let me not fall 5307-4 into the hand 3027 of man. 120

24:15 So the LORD 3068 sent 5414-4 a pestilence 1698 upon Israel 3478 from the morning 1242 even to the time 6256 appointed: 4150 and there died 4191-4 of the people 5971 from Dan 1835 even to Beersheba 884 seventy 7657 thousand 505 men. 376

24:16 And when the angel 4397 stretched out 7971-4 his hand 3027 upon Jerusalem 3389 to destroy 7843-15 it, the LORD 3068 repented 5162-11 him of the evil, 7451 and said 559-4 to the angel 4397 that destroyed 7843-56 the people, 5971 It is enough: 7227 stay 7503-54 now thine hand. 3027 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 was by the threshingplace 1637 of Araunah 728 the Jebusite. 2983

24:17 And David 1732 spake 559-4 unto the LORD 3068 when he saw 7200-2 the angel 4397 that smote 5221-56 the people, 5971 and said, 559-4 Lo, I have sinned, 2398-1 and I have done wickedly: 5753-52 but these sheep, 6629 what have they done? 6213-1 let thine hand, 3027 I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's 1 house. 1004

24:18 And Gad 1410 came 935-4 that day 3117 to David, 1732 and said 559-4 unto him, Go up, 5927-3 rear 6965-54 an altar 4196 unto the LORD 3068 in the threshingfloor 1637 of Araunah 728 the Jebusite. 2983

24:19 And David, 1732 according to the saying 1697 of Gad, 1410 went up 5927-4 as the LORD 3068 commanded. 6680-14

24:20 And Araunah 728 looked, 8259-55 and saw 7200-4 the king 4428 and his servants 5650 coming on 5674-6 toward him: and Araunah 728 went out, 3318-4 and bowed 7812-101 himself before the king 4428 on his face 639 upon the ground. 776

24:21 And Araunah 728 said, 559-4 Wherefore is my lord 113 the king 4428 come 935-1 to his servant? 5650 And David 1732 said, 559-4 To buy 7069-2 the threshingfloor 1637 of thee, to build 1129-2 an altar 4196 unto the LORD, 3068 that the plague 4046 may be stayed 6113-11 from the people. 5971

24:22 And Araunah 728 said 559-4 unto David, 1732 Let my lord 113 the king 4428 take 3947-4 and offer up 5927-55 what [seemeth] good 2896 unto him: 5869 behold, 7200-3 [here be] oxen 1241 for burnt sacrifice, 5930 and threshing instruments 4173 and [other] instruments 3627 of the oxen 1241 for wood. 6086

24:23 All these [things] did Araunah, 728 [as] a king, 4428 give 5414-1 unto the king. 4428 And Araunah 728 said 559-4 unto the king, 4428 The LORD 3068 thy God 430 accept 7521-4 thee.

24:24 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto Araunah, 728 Nay; but I will surely 7069-2 buy 7069-4 [it] of thee at a price: 4242 neither will I offer 5927-55 burnt offerings 5930 unto the LORD 3068 my God 430 of that which doth cost me nothing. 2600 So David 1732 bought 7069-4 the threshingfloor 1637 and the oxen 1241 for fifty 2572 shekels 8255 of silver. 3701

24:25 And David 1732 built 1129-4 there an altar 4196 unto the LORD, 3068 and offered 5927-55 burnt offerings 5930 and peace offerings. 8002 So the LORD 3068 was intreated 6279-11 for the land, 776 and the plague 4046 was stayed 6113-11 from Israel. 3478
