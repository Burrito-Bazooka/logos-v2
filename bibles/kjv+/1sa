1:1 Now there was a certain 259 man 376 of Ramathaimzophim, 7413|6822|7436 of mount 2022 Ephraim, 669 and his name 8034 [was] Elkanah, 511 the son 1121 of Jeroham, 3395 the son 1121 of Elihu, 453 the son 1121 of Tohu, 8459 the son 1121 of Zuph, 6689 an Ephrathite: 673

1:2 And he had two 8147 wives; 802 the name 8034 of the one 259 [was] Hannah, 2584 and the name 8034 of the other 8145 Peninnah: 6444 and Peninnah 6444 had children, 3206 but Hannah 2584 had no children. 3206

1:3 And this 1931 man 376 went up 5927-1 out of his city 5892 yearly 3117 3117 to worship 7812-99 and to sacrifice 2076-2 unto the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 in Shiloh. 7887 And the two 8147 sons 1121 of Eli, 5941 Hophni 2652 and Phinehas, 6372 the priests 3548 of the LORD, 3068 [were] there.

1:4 And when the time 3117 was that Elkanah 511 offered, 2076-4 he gave 5414-1 to Peninnah 6444 his wife, 802 and to all her sons 1121 and her daughters, 1323 portions: 4490

1:5 But unto Hannah 2584 he gave 5414-4 a 259 worthy 639 portion; 4490 for he loved 157-1 Hannah: 2584 but the LORD 3068 had shut up 5462-1 her womb. 7358

1:6 And her adversary 6869 also provoked 3707-14 her sore, 3708 for to make her fret, 7481-53 because the LORD 3068 had shut 5462-1 up 1157 her womb. 7358

1:7 And [as] he did 6213-4 so year 8141 by year, 8141 when 1767 she went up 5927-2 to the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 so she provoked 3707-55 her; therefore she wept, 1058-4 and did not eat. 398-4

1:8 Then said 559-4 Elkanah 511 her husband 376 to her, Hannah, 2584 why weepest 1058-4 thou? and why eatest 398-4 thou not? and why is thy heart 3824 grieved? 3415-4 [am] not I better 2896 to thee than ten 6235 sons? 1121

1:9 So Hannah 2584 rose up 6965-4 after 310 they had eaten 398-2 in Shiloh, 7887 and after 310 they had drunk. 8354-2 Now Eli 5941 the priest 3548 sat 3427-6 upon a seat 3678 by a post 4201 of the temple 1964 of the LORD. 3068

1:10 And she [was] in bitterness 4751 of soul, 5315 and prayed 6419-101 unto the LORD, 3068 and wept 1058-4 sore. 1058-2

1:11 And she vowed 5087-4 a vow, 5088 and said, 559-4 O LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 if thou wilt indeed 7200-2 look 7200-4 on the affliction 6040 of thine handmaid, 519 and remember 2142-1 me, and not forget 7911-4 thine handmaid, 519 but wilt give 5414-1 unto thine handmaid 519 a man 582 child, 2233 then I will give 5414-1 him unto the LORD 3068 all the days 3117 of his life, 2416 and there shall no razor 4177 come 5927-4 upon his head. 7218

1:12 And it came to pass, as she continued 7235-52 praying 6419-99 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 that Eli 5941 marked 8104-6 her mouth. 6310

1:13 Now Hannah, 2584 she spake 1696-18 in her heart; 3820 only her lips 8193 moved, 5128-5 but her voice 6963 was not heard: 8085-11 therefore Eli 5941 thought 2803-4 she had been drunken. 7910

1:14 And Eli 5941 said 559-4 unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? 7937-101 put away 5493-54 thy wine 3196 from thee.

1:15 And Hannah 2584 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 No, my lord, 113 I [am] a woman 802 of a sorrowful 7186 spirit: 7307 I have drunk 8354-1 neither wine 3196 nor strong drink, 7941 but have poured out 8210-4 my soul 5315 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

1:16 Count 5414-4 not thine handmaid 519 for 6440 a daughter 1323 of Belial: 1100 for out of the abundance 7230 of my complaint 7879 and grief 3708 have I spoken 1696-14 hitherto.

1:17 Then Eli 5941 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 Go 3212-3 in peace: 7965 and the God 430 of Israel 3478 grant 5414-4 [thee] thy petition 7596 that thou hast asked 7592-1 of him.

1:18 And she said, 559-4 Let thine handmaid 8198 find 4672-4 grace 2580 in thy sight. 5869 So the woman 802 went 3212-4 her way, 1870 and did eat, 398-4 and her countenance 6440 was no more [sad].

1:19 And they rose up in the morning 1242 early, 7925-55 and worshipped 7812-101 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and returned, 7725-4 and came 935-4 to their house 1004 to Ramah: 7414 and Elkanah 511 knew 3045-4 Hannah 2584 his wife; 802 and the LORD 3068 remembered 2142-4 her.

1:20 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time 3117 was come 8622 about after Hannah 2584 had conceived, 2029-4 that she bare 3205-4 a son, 1121 and called 7121-4 his name 8034 Samuel, 8050 [saying], Because I have asked 7592-1 him of the LORD. 3068

1:21 And the man 376 Elkanah, 511 and all his house, 1004 went up 5927-4 to offer 2076-2 unto the LORD 3068 the yearly 3117 sacrifice, 2077 and his vow. 5088

1:22 But Hannah 2584 went not up; 5927-1 for she said 559-1 unto her husband, 376 [I will not go up] until the child 5288 be weaned, 1580-11 and [then] I will bring 935-52 him, that he may appear 7200-8 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and there abide 3427-1 for 5704 ever. 5769

1:23 And Elkanah 511 her husband 376 said 559-4 unto her, Do 6213-3 what seemeth 5869 thee good; 2896 tarry 3427-3 until thou have weaned 1580-2 him; only the LORD 3068 establish 6965-55 his word. 1697 So the woman 802 abode, 3427-4 and gave her son 1121 suck 3243-55 until she weaned 1580-2 him.

1:24 And when she had weaned 1580-1 him, she took him up 5927-55 with her, with three 7969 bullocks, 6499 and one 259 ephah 374 of flour, 7058 and a bottle 5035 of wine, 3196 and brought 935-55 him unto the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 in Shiloh: 7887 and the child 5288 [was] young. 5288

1:25 And they slew 7819-4 a bullock, 6499 and brought 935-55 the child 5288 to Eli. 5941

1:26 And she said, 559-4 Oh 994 my lord, 113 [as] thy soul 5315 liveth, 2416 my lord, 113 I [am] the woman 802 that stood 5324-12 by thee here, praying 6419-99 unto the LORD. 3068

1:27 For this child 5288 I prayed; 6419-98 and the LORD 3068 hath given 5414-4 me my petition 7596 which I asked 7592-1 of him:

1:28 Therefore also I have lent 7592-52 him to the LORD; 3068 as long 3605 as 3117 he liveth he shall be lent 7592-7 to the LORD. 3068 And he worshipped 7812-101 the LORD 3068 there.

2:1 And Hannah 2584 prayed, 6419-101 and said, 559-4 My heart 3820 rejoiceth 5970-1 in the LORD, 3068 mine horn 7161 is exalted 7311-1 in the LORD: 3068 my mouth 6310 is enlarged 7337-1 over mine enemies; 341-6 because I rejoice 8055-1 in thy salvation. 3444

2:2 [There is] none holy 6918 as the LORD: 3068 for [there is] none beside 1115 thee: neither [is there] any rock 6697 like our God. 430

2:3 Talk 1696-17 no more 7235-55 so exceeding 1364 proudly; 1364 let [not] arrogancy 6277 come out 3318-4 of your mouth: 6310 for the LORD 3068 [is] a God 410 of knowledge, 1844 and by him actions 5949 are weighed. 8505-8

2:4 The bows 7198 of the mighty 1368 men [are] broken, 2844 and they that stumbled 3782-12 are girded 247-1 with strength. 2428

2:5 [They that were] full 7649 have hired out 7936-8 themselves for bread; 3899 and [they that were] hungry 7457 ceased: 2308-1 so that the barren 6135 hath born 3205-1 seven; 7651 and she that hath many 7227 children 1121 is waxed feeble. 535-49

2:6 The LORD 3068 killeth, 4191-56 and maketh alive: 2421-18 he bringeth down 3381-56 to the grave, 7585 and bringeth up. 5927-55

2:7 The LORD 3068 maketh poor, 3423-56 and maketh rich: 6238-56 he bringeth low, 8213-56 and 637 lifteth up. 7311-35

2:8 He raiseth up 6965-56 the poor 1800 out of the dust, 6083 [and] lifteth up 7311-55 the beggar 34 from the dunghill, 830 to set 3427-53 [them] among princes, 5081 and to make them inherit 5157-55 the throne 3678 of glory: 3519 for the pillars 4690 of the earth 776 [are] the LORD'S, 3068 and he hath set 7896-4 the world 8398 upon them.

2:9 He will keep 8104-4 the feet 7272 of his saints, 2623 and the wicked 7563 shall be silent 1826-11 in darkness; 2822 for by strength 3581 shall no man 376 prevail. 1396-4

2:10 The adversaries 7378-56 of the LORD 3068 shall be broken to pieces; 2865-11 out of heaven 8064 shall he thunder 7481-55 upon them: the LORD 3068 shall judge 1777-4 the ends 657 of the earth; 776 and he shall give 5414-4 strength 5797 unto his king, 4428 and exalt 7311-55 the horn 7161 of his anointed. 4899

2:11 And Elkanah 511 went 3212-4 to Ramah 7414 to his house. 1004 And the child 5288 did 1961-1 minister 8334-18 unto the LORD 3068 before 6440 Eli 5941 the priest. 3548

2:12 Now the sons 1121 of Eli 5941 [were] sons 1121 of Belial; 1100 they knew 3045-1 not the LORD. 3068

2:13 And the priests' 3548 custom 4941 with the people 5971 [was, that], when any man 376 offered 2076-6 sacrifice, 2077 the priest's 3548 servant 5288 came, 935-1 while the flesh 1320 was in seething, 1310-15 with a fleshhook 4207 of three 7969 teeth 8127 in his hand; 3027

2:14 And he struck 5221-52 [it] into the pan, 3595 or kettle, 1731 or caldron, 7037 or pot; 6517 all that the fleshhook 4207 brought up 5927-55 the priest 3548 took 3947-4 for himself. So they did 6213-4 in Shiloh 7887 unto all the Israelites 3478 that came 935-6 thither.

2:15 Also before they burnt 6999-55 the fat, 2459 the priest's 3548 servant 5288 came, 935-1 and said 559-1 to the man 376 that sacrificed, 2076-6 Give 5414-3 flesh 1320 to roast 6740-2 for the priest; 3548 for he will not have 3947-4 sodden 1310-30 flesh 1320 of thee, but raw. 2416

2:16 And [if] any man 376 said 559-4 unto him, Let them not fail 6999-15 to burn 6999-55 the fat 2459 presently, 3117 and [then] take 3947-3 [as much] as thy soul 5315 desireth; 183-17 then he would answer 559-1 him, [Nay]; but thou shalt give 5414-4 [it me] now: and if not, I will take 3947-1 [it] by force. 2393

2:17 Wherefore the sin 2403 of the young men 5288 was very 3966 great 1419 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 for men 582 abhorred 5006-14 the offering 4503 of the LORD. 3068

2:18 But Samuel 8050 ministered 8334-18 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 [being] a child, 5288 girded 2296-7 with a linen 906 ephod. 646

2:19 Moreover his mother 517 made 6213-4 him a little 6996 coat, 4598 and brought 5927-52 [it] to him from year 3117 to year, 3117 when she came up 5927-2 with her husband 376 to offer 2076-2 the yearly 3117 sacrifice. 2077

2:20 And Eli 5941 blessed 1288-14 Elkanah 511 and his wife, 802 and said, 559-1 The LORD 3068 give 7760-4 thee seed 2233 of this woman 802 for the loan 7596 which is lent 7592-1 to the LORD. 3068 And they went 1980-1 unto their own home. 4725

2:21 And 3588 the LORD 3068 visited 6485-1 Hannah, 2584 so that she conceived, 2029-4 and bare 3205-4 three 7969 sons 1121 and two 8147 daughters. 1323 And the child 5288 Samuel 8050 grew 1431-4 before 5973 the LORD. 3068

2:22 Now Eli 5941 was very 3966 old, 2204-1 and heard 8085-1 all that his sons 1121 did 6213-4 unto all Israel; 3478 and how they lay 7901-4 with the women 802 that assembled 6633-6 [at] the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150

2:23 And he said 559-4 unto them, Why do 6213-4 ye such things? 1697 for I hear 8085-6 of your evil 7451 dealings 1697 by all this people. 5971

2:24 Nay, my sons; 1121 for [it is] no good 2896 report 8052 that I hear: 8085-6 ye make the LORD'S 3068 people 5971 to transgress. 5674-56

2:25 If one man 376 sin 2398-4 against another, 376 the judge 430 shall judge 6419-14 him: but if a man 376 sin 2398-4 against the LORD, 3068 who shall intreat 6419-101 for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened 8085-4 not unto the voice 6963 of their father, 1 because the LORD 3068 would 2654-1 slay 4191-53 them.

2:26 And the child 5288 Samuel 8050 grew 1432 on, 1980-6 and was in favour 2896 both with the LORD, 3068 and also with men. 582

2:27 And there came 935-4 a man 376 of God 430 unto Eli, 5941 and said 559-4 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Did I plainly 1540-9 appear 1540-8 unto the house 1004 of thy father, 1 when they were in Egypt 4714 in Pharaoh's 6547 house? 1004

2:28 And did I choose 977-2 him out of all the tribes 7626 of Israel 3478 [to be] my priest, 3548 to offer 5927-2 upon mine altar, 4196 to burn 6999-53 incense, 7004 to wear 5375-2 an ephod 646 before 6440 me? and did I give 5414-4 unto the house 1004 of thy father 1 all the offerings made by fire 801 of the children 1121 of Israel? 3478

2:29 Wherefore kick 1163-4 ye at my sacrifice 2077 and at mine offering, 4503 which I have commanded 6680-14 [in my] habitation; 4583 and honourest 3513-17 thy sons 1121 above me, to make yourselves fat 1254-53 with the chiefest 7225 of all the offerings 4503 of Israel 3478 my people? 5971

2:30 Wherefore the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 saith, 5002-7 I said 559-1 indeed 559-2 [that] thy house, 1004 and the house 1004 of thy father, 1 should walk 1980-101 before 6440 me for 5704 ever: 5769 but now the LORD 3068 saith, 5002-7 Be it far 2486 from me; for them that honour 3513-18 me I will honour, 3513-17 and they that despise 959-6 me shall be lightly esteemed. 7043-4

2:31 Behold, the days 3117 come, 935-6 that I will cut off 1438-1 thine arm, 2220 and the arm 2220 of thy father's 1 house, 1004 that there shall not be an old man 2205 in thine house. 1004

2:32 And thou shalt see 5027-52 an enemy 6862 [in my] habitation, 4583 in all [the wealth] which [God] shall give 3190-55 Israel: 3478 and there shall not be an old man 2205 in thine house 1004 for ever. 3605 3117

2:33 And the man 376 of thine, [whom] I shall not cut off 3772-55 from mine altar, 4196 [shall be] to consume 3615-15 thine eyes, 5869 and to grieve 109 thine heart: 5315 and all the increase 4768 of thine house 1004 shall die 4191-4 in the flower of their age. 582

2:34 And this [shall be] a sign 226 unto thee, that shall come 935-4 upon thy two 8147 sons, 1121 on Hophni 2652 and Phinehas; 6372 in one 259 day 3117 they shall die 4191-4 both 8147 of them.

2:35 And I will raise me up 6965-52 a faithful 539-12 priest, 3548 [that] shall do 6213-4 according to [that] which [is] in mine heart 3824 and in my mind: 5315 and I will build 1129-1 him a sure 539-12 house; 1004 and he shall walk 1980-98 before 6440 mine anointed 4899 for ever. 3605 3117

2:36 And it shall come to pass, [that] every one that is left 3498-12 in thine house 1004 shall come 935-4 [and] crouch 7812-99 to him for a piece 95 of silver 3701 and a morsel 3603 of bread, 3899 and shall say, 559-1 Put 5596-3 me, I pray thee, into one 259 of the priests' offices, 3550 that I may eat 398-2 a piece 6595 of bread. 3899

3:1 And the child 5288 Samuel 8050 ministered 8334-18 unto the LORD 3068 before 6440 Eli. 5941 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 was precious 3368 in those days; 3117 [there was] no open 6555-12 vision. 2377

3:2 And it came to pass at that time, 3117 when Eli 5941 [was] laid down 7901-6 in his place, 4725 and his eyes 5869 began 2490-52 to wax dim, 3544 [that] he could 3201-4 not see; 7200-2

3:3 And ere the lamp 5216 of God 430 went out 3518-4 in the temple 1964 of the LORD, 3068 where the ark 727 of God 430 [was], and Samuel 8050 was laid down 7901-6 [to sleep];

3:4 That the LORD 3068 called 7121-4 Samuel: 8050 and he answered, 559-4 Here [am] I.

3:5 And he ran 7323-4 unto Eli, 5941 and said, 559-4 Here [am] I; 2009 for thou calledst 7121-1 me. And he said, 559-4 I called 7121-1 not; lie down 7901-3 again. 7725-3 And he went 3212-4 and lay down. 7901-4

3:6 And the LORD 3068 called 7121-2 yet again, 3254-55 Samuel. 8050 And Samuel 8050 arose 6965-4 and went 3212-4 to Eli, 5941 and said, 559-4 Here [am] I; for thou didst call 7121-1 me. And he answered, 559-4 I called 7121-1 not, my son; 1121 lie down 7901-3 again. 7725-3

3:7 Now Samuel 8050 did not yet 2962 know 3045-1 the LORD, 3068 neither 2962 was the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 yet revealed 1540-11 unto him.

3:8 And the LORD 3068 called 7121-2 Samuel 8050 again 3254-55 the third 7992 time. And he arose 6965-4 and went 3212-4 to Eli, 5941 and said, 559-4 Here [am] I; for thou didst call 7121-1 me. And Eli 5941 perceived 995-4 that the LORD 3068 had called 7121-6 the child. 5288

3:9 Therefore Eli 5941 said 559-4 unto Samuel, 8050 Go, 3212-3 lie down: 7901-3 and it shall be, if he call 7121-4 thee, that thou shalt say, 559-1 Speak, 1696-16 LORD; 3068 for thy servant 5650 heareth. 8085-6 So Samuel 8050 went 3212-4 and lay down 7901-4 in his place. 4725

3:10 And the LORD 3068 came, 935-4 and stood, 3320-101 and called 7121-4 as at other times, 6471 6471 Samuel, 8050 Samuel. 8050 Then Samuel 8050 answered, 559-4 Speak; 1696-16 for thy servant 5650 heareth. 8085-6

3:11 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 to Samuel, 8050 Behold, I will do 6213-6 a thing 1697 in Israel, 3478 at which both 8147 the ears 241 of every one that heareth 8085-6 it shall tingle. 6750-4

3:12 In that day 3117 I will perform 6965-55 against Eli 5941 all [things] which I have spoken 1696-14 concerning 413 his house: 1004 when I begin, 2490-53 I will also make an end. 3615-15

3:13 For I have told 5046-52 him that I will judge 8199-6 his house 1004 for 5704 ever 5769 for the iniquity 5771 which he knoweth; 3045-1 because his sons 1121 made themselves vile, 7043-18 and he restrained 3543-14 them not.

3:14 And therefore I have sworn 7650-8 unto the house 1004 of Eli, 5941 that the iniquity 5771 of Eli's 5941 house 1004 shall not be purged 3722-101 with sacrifice 2077 nor offering 4503 for 5704 ever. 5769

3:15 And Samuel 8050 lay 7901-4 until the morning, 1242 and opened 6605-4 the doors 1817 of the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068 And Samuel 8050 feared 3372-1 to shew 5046-53 Eli 5941 the vision. 4759

3:16 Then Eli 5941 called 7121-4 Samuel, 8050 and said, 559-4 Samuel, 8050 my son. 1121 And he answered, 559-4 Here [am] I.

3:17 And he said, 559-4 What [is] the thing 1697 that [the LORD] hath said 1696-14 unto thee? I pray thee hide 3582-17 [it] not from me: God 430 do 6213-4 so to thee, and more 3254-55 also, if thou hide 3582-17 [any] thing 1697 from me of all the things 1697 that he said 1696-14 unto thee.

3:18 And Samuel 8050 told 5046-55 him every whit, 1697 and hid 3582-14 nothing from him. And he said, 559-4 It [is] the LORD: 3068 let him do 6213-4 what seemeth 5869 him good. 2896

3:19 And Samuel 8050 grew, 1431-4 and the LORD 3068 was with him, and did let none of his words 1697 fall 5307-52 to the ground. 776

3:20 And all Israel 3478 from Dan 1835 even to Beersheba 884 knew 3045-4 that Samuel 8050 [was] established 539-12 [to be] a prophet 5030 of the LORD. 3068

3:21 And the LORD 3068 appeared 7200-9 again 3254-55 in Shiloh: 7887 for the LORD 3068 revealed 1540-8 himself to Samuel 8050 in Shiloh 7887 by the word 1697 of the LORD. 3068

4:1 And the word 1697 of Samuel 8050 came to all Israel. 3478 Now Israel 3478 went out 3318-4 against 7125-2 the Philistines 6430 to battle, 4421 and pitched 2583-4 beside Ebenezer: 72 and the Philistines 6430 pitched 2583-1 in Aphek. 663

4:2 And the Philistines 6430 put themselves in array 6186-4 against 7125-2 Israel: 3478 and when they joined 5203-4 battle, 4421 Israel 3478 was smitten 5062-11 before 6440 the Philistines: 6430 and they slew 5221-55 of the army 4634 in the field 7704 about four 702 thousand 505 men. 376

4:3 And when the people 5971 were come 935-4 into the camp, 4264 the elders 2205 of Israel 3478 said, 559-4 Wherefore hath the LORD 3068 smitten 5062-1 us to day 3117 before 6440 the Philistines? 6430 Let us fetch 3947-4 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 out of Shiloh 7887 unto us, that, when it cometh 935-4 among 7130 us, it may save 3467-55 us out of the hand 3709 of our enemies. 341-6

4:4 So the people 5971 sent 7971-4 to Shiloh, 7887 that they might bring 5375-4 from thence the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 which dwelleth 3427-6 [between] the cherubims: 3742 and the two 8147 sons 1121 of Eli, 5941 Hophni 2652 and Phinehas, 6372 [were] there with the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of God. 430

4:5 And when the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 came 935-2 into the camp, 4264 all Israel 3478 shouted 7321-55 with a great 1419 shout, 8643 so that the earth 776 rang again. 1949-11

4:6 And when the Philistines 6430 heard 8085-4 the noise 6963 of the shout, 8643 they said, 559-4 What [meaneth] the noise 6963 of this great 1419 shout 8643 in the camp 4264 of the Hebrews? 5680 And they understood 3045-4 that the ark 727 of the LORD 3068 was come 935-1 into the camp. 4264

4:7 And the Philistines 6430 were afraid, 3372-4 for they said, 559-1 God 430 is come 935-1 into the camp. 4264 And they said, 559-4 Woe 188 unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore. 865 8032

4:8 Woe 188 unto us! who shall deliver 5337-55 us out of the hand 3027 of these mighty 117 Gods? 430 these [are] the Gods 430 that smote 5221-56 the Egyptians 4714 with all the plagues 4347 in the wilderness. 4057

4:9 Be strong, 2388-100 and quit 1961-3 yourselves like men, 582 O ye Philistines, 6430 that ye be not servants 5647-4 unto the Hebrews, 5680 as they have been 5647-1 to you: quit 1961-3 yourselves like men, 582 and fight. 3898-8

4:10 And the Philistines 6430 fought, 3898-11 and Israel 3478 was smitten, 5062-11 and they fled 5127-4 every man 376 into his tent: 168 and there was a very 3966 great 1419 slaughter; 4347 for there fell 5307-4 of Israel 3478 thirty 7970 thousand 505 footmen. 7273

4:11 And the ark 727 of God 430 was taken; 3947-8 and the two 8147 sons 1121 of Eli, 5941 Hophni 2652 and Phinehas, 6372 were slain. 4191-1

4:12 And there ran 7323-4 a man 376 of Benjamin 1144 out of the army, 4634 and came 935-4 to Shiloh 7887 the same day 3117 with his clothes 4055 rent, 7167-7 and with earth 127 upon his head. 7218

4:13 And when he came, 935-4 lo, Eli 5941 sat 3427-6 upon a seat 3678 by the wayside 1870 3027|3197-k watching: 6822-18 for his heart 3820 trembled 2730 for the ark 727 of God. 430 And when the man 376 came 935-6 into the city, 5892 and told 5046-53 [it], all the city 5892 cried out. 2199-4

4:14 And when Eli 5941 heard 8085-4 the noise 6963 of the crying, 6818 he said, 559-4 What [meaneth] the noise 6963 of this tumult? 1995 And the man 376 came 935-4 in hastily, 4116-14 and told 5046-55 Eli. 5941

4:15 Now Eli 5941 was ninety 8673 and eight 8083 years 8141 old; 1121 and his eyes 5869 were dim, 6965-1 that he could 3201-1 not see. 7200-2

4:16 And the man 376 said 559-4 unto Eli, 5941 I [am] he that came 935-6 out of the army, 4634 and I fled 5127-1 to day 3117 out of the army. 4634 And he said, 559-4 What is there done, 1697 my son? 1121

4:17 And the messenger 1319-18 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 Israel 3478 is fled 5127-1 before 6440 the Philistines, 6430 and there hath been also a great 1419 slaughter 4046 among the people, 5971 and thy two 8147 sons 1121 also, Hophni 2652 and Phinehas, 6372 are dead, 4191-1 and the ark 727 of God 430 is taken. 3947-8

4:18 And it came to pass, when he made mention 2142-53 of the ark 727 of God, 430 that he fell 5307-4 from off the seat 3678 backward 322 by 1157 the side 3027 of the gate, 8179 and his neck 4665 brake, 7665-11 and he died: 4191-4 for he was an old 2204-1 man, 376 and heavy. 3513-1 And he had judged 8199-1 Israel 3478 forty 705 years. 8141

4:19 And his daughter in law, 3618 Phinehas' 6372 wife, 802 was with child, 2030 [near] to be delivered: 3205-2 and when she heard 8085-4 the tidings 8052 that 413 the ark 727 of God 430 was taken, 3947-9 and that her father in law 2524 and her husband 376 were dead, 4191-1 she bowed 3766-4 herself and travailed; 3205-4 for her pains 6735 came 2015-8 upon her.

4:20 And about the time 6256 of her death 4191-2 the women that stood 5324-12 by her said 1696-17 unto her, Fear 3372-4 not; for thou hast born 3205-1 a son. 1121 But she answered 6030-1 not, neither did she regard 7896-1 3820 [it].

4:21 And she named 7121-4 the child 5288 Ichabod, 350 saying, 559-2 The glory 3519 is departed 1540-1 from Israel: 3478 because 413 the ark 727 of God 430 was taken, 3947-9 and because of her father in law 2524 and her husband. 376

4:22 And she said, 559-4 The glory 3519 is departed 1540-1 from Israel: 3478 for the ark 727 of God 430 is taken. 3947-8

5:1 And the Philistines 6430 took 3947-1 the ark 727 of God, 430 and brought 935-55 it from Ebenezer 72 unto Ashdod. 795

5:2 When the Philistines 6430 took 3947-4 the ark 727 of God, 430 they brought 935-55 it into the house 1004 of Dagon, 1712 and set 3322-55 it by 681 Dagon. 1712

5:3 And when they of Ashdod 796 arose early 7925-55 on the morrow, 4283 behold, Dagon 1712 [was] fallen 5307-6 upon his face 6440 to the earth 776 before 6440 the ark 727 of the LORD. 3068 And they took 3947-4 Dagon, 1712 and set him in his place 4725 again. 7725-55

5:4 And when they arose early 7925-55 on the morrow 4283 morning, 1242 behold, Dagon 1712 [was] fallen 5307-6 upon his face 6440 to the ground 776 before 6440 the ark 727 of the LORD; 3068 and the head 7218 of Dagon 1712 and both 8147 the palms 3709 of his hands 3027 [were] cut off 3772-7 upon the threshold; 4670 only [the stump of] Dagon 1712 was left 7604-8 to him.

5:5 Therefore neither the priests 3548 of Dagon, 1712 nor any that come 935-6 into Dagon's 1712 house, 1004 tread 1869-4 on the threshold 4670 of Dagon 1712 in Ashdod 795 unto this day. 3117

5:6 But the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 was heavy 3513-4 upon them of Ashdod, 796 and he destroyed 8074-55 them, and smote 5221-55 them with emerods, 2914|6076-k [even] Ashdod 795 and the coasts 1366 thereof.

5:7 And when the men 582 of Ashdod 795 saw 7200-4 that [it was] so, they said, 559-1 The ark 727 of the God 430 of Israel 3478 shall not abide 3427-4 with us: for his hand 3027 is sore 7185-1 upon us, and upon Dagon 1712 our god. 430

5:8 They sent 7971-4 therefore and gathered 622-4 all the lords 5633 of the Philistines 6430 unto them, and said, 559-4 What shall we do 6213-4 with the ark 727 of the God 430 of Israel? 3478 And they answered, 559-4 Let the ark 727 of the God 430 of Israel 3478 be carried about 5437-11 unto Gath. 1661 And they carried 5437-55 the ark 727 of the God 430 of Israel 3478 about [thither].

5:9 And it was [so], that, after 310 they had carried it about, 5437-52 the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 was against the city 5892 with a very 3966 great 1419 destruction: 4103 and he smote 5221-55 the men 582 of the city, 5892 both small 6996 and great, 1419 and they had emerods 2914|6076-k in their secret parts. 8368-11

5:10 Therefore they sent 7971-17 the ark 727 of God 430 to Ekron. 6138 And it came to pass, as the ark 727 of God 430 came 935-2 to Ekron, 6138 that the Ekronites 6139 cried out, 2199-4 saying, 559-2 They have brought about 5437-52 the ark 727 of the God 430 of Israel 3478 to us, to slay 4191-53 us and our people. 5971

5:11 So they sent 7971-4 and gathered 622-4 together all the lords 5633 of the Philistines, 6430 and said, 559-4 Send away 7971-16 the ark 727 of the God 430 of Israel, 3478 and let it go again 7725-4 to his own place, 4725 that it slay 4191-55 us not, and our people: 5971 for there was a deadly 4194 destruction 4103 throughout all the city; 5892 the hand 3027 of God 430 was very 3966 heavy 3513-1 there.

5:12 And the men 582 that died 4191-1 not were smitten 5221-90 with the emerods: 2914|6076-k and the cry 7775 of the city 5892 went up 5927-4 to heaven. 8064

6:1 And the ark 727 of the LORD 3068 was in the country 7704 of the Philistines 6430 seven 7651 months. 2320

6:2 And the Philistines 6430 called 7121-4 for the priests 3548 and the diviners, 7080-6 saying, 559-2 What shall we do 6213-4 to the ark 727 of the LORD? 3068 tell 3045-54 us wherewith we shall send 7971-17 it to his place. 4725

6:3 And they said, 559-4 If ye send away 7971-18 the ark 727 of the God 430 of Israel, 3478 send 7971-17 it not empty; 7387 but in any wise 7725-53 return 7725-55 him a trespass offering: 817 then ye shall be healed, 7495-11 and it shall be known 3045-8 to you why his hand 3027 is not removed 5493-4 from you.

6:4 Then said 559-4 they, What [shall be] the trespass offering 817 which we shall return 7725-55 to him? They answered, 559-4 Five 2568 golden 2091 emerods, 2914|6076-k and five 2568 golden 2091 mice, 5909 [according to] the number 4557 of the lords 5633 of the Philistines: 6430 for one 259 plague 4046 [was] on you all, and on your lords. 5633

6:5 Wherefore ye shall make 6213-1 images 6754 of your emerods, 2914|6076-k and images 6754 of your mice 5909 that mar 7843-56 the land; 776 and ye shall give 5414-1 glory 3519 unto the God 430 of Israel: 3478 peradventure he will lighten 7043-55 his hand 3027 from off you, and from off your gods, 430 and from off your land. 776

6:6 Wherefore then do ye harden 3513-17 your hearts, 3824 as the Egyptians 4714 and Pharaoh 6547 hardened 3513-14 their hearts? 3820 when he had wrought wonderfully 5953-98 among them, did they not let the people go, 7971-17 and they departed? 3212-4

6:7 Now therefore make 6213-3 a 259 new 2319 cart, 5699 and take 3947-3 two 8147 milch 5763-6 kine, 6510 on which there hath come 5927-1 no yoke, 5923 and tie 631-1 the kine 6510 to the cart, 5699 and bring 7725-52 their calves 1121 home 1004 from 310 them:

6:8 And take 3947-1 the ark 727 of the LORD, 3068 and lay 5414-1 it upon the cart; 5699 and put 7760-4 the jewels 3627 of gold, 2091 which ye return 7725-52 him [for] a trespass offering, 817 in a coffer 712 by the side 6654 thereof; and send it away, 7971-14 that it may go. 1980-1

6:9 And see, 7200-1 if it goeth up 5927-4 by the way 1870 of his own coast 1366 to Bethshemesh, 1053 [then] he hath done 6213-1 us this great 1419 evil: 7451 but if not, then we shall know 3045-1 that [it is] not his hand 3027 [that] smote 5060-1 us: it [was] a chance 4745 [that] happened 1961-1 to us.

6:10 And the men 582 did 6213-4 so; and took 3947-4 two 8147 milch 5763-6 kine, 6510 and tied 631-4 them to the cart, 5699 and shut up 3607-1 their calves 1121 at home: 1004

6:11 And they laid 7760-4 the ark 727 of the LORD 3068 upon the cart, 5699 and the coffer 712 with the mice 5909 of gold 2091 and the images 6754 of their emerods. 2914

6:12 And the kine 6510 took the straight 3474-4 way 1870 to the way 1870 of Bethshemesh, 1053 [and] went 1980-1 along 1980-2 the highway, 4546 259 lowing 1600-2 as they went, and turned not aside 5493-1 [to] the right hand 3225 or [to] the left; 8040 and the lords 5633 of the Philistines 6430 went 1980-6 after 310 them unto the border 1366 of Bethshemesh. 1053

6:13 And [they of] Bethshemesh 1053 [were] reaping 7114-6 their wheat 2406 harvest 7105 in the valley: 6010 and they lifted up 5375-4 their eyes, 5869 and saw 7200-4 the ark, 727 and rejoiced 8055-4 to see 7200-2 [it].

6:14 And the cart 5699 came 935-6 into the field 7704 of Joshua, 3091 a Bethshemite, 1030 and stood 5975-4 there, where [there was] a great 1419 stone: 68 and they clave 1234-17 the wood 6086 of the cart, 5699 and offered 5927-52 the kine 6510 a burnt offering 5930 unto the LORD. 3068

6:15 And the Levites 3881 took down 3381-52 the ark 727 of the LORD, 3068 and the coffer 712 that [was] with it, wherein the jewels 3627 of gold 2091 [were], and put 7760-4 [them] on the great 1419 stone: 68 and the men 582 of Bethshemesh 1053 offered 5927-52 burnt offerings 5930 and sacrificed 2076-4 sacrifices 2077 the same day 3117 unto the LORD. 3068

6:16 And when the five 2568 lords 5633 of the Philistines 6430 had seen 7200-1 [it], they returned 7725-4 to Ekron 6138 the same day. 3117

6:17 And these [are] the golden 2091 emerods 2914 which the Philistines 6430 returned 7725-52 [for] a trespass offering 817 unto the LORD; 3068 for Ashdod 795 one, 259 for Gaza 5804 one, 259 for Askelon 831 one, 259 for Gath 1661 one, 259 for Ekron 6138 one; 259

6:18 And the golden 2091 mice, 5909 [according to] the number 4557 of all the cities 5892 of the Philistines 6430 [belonging] to the five 2568 lords, 5633 [both] of fenced 4013 cities, 5892 and of country 6521 villages, 3724 even unto the great 1419 [stone of] Abel, 59 whereon they set down 3240-52 the ark 727 of the LORD: 3068 [which stone remaineth] unto this day 3117 in the field 7704 of Joshua, 3091 the Bethshemite. 1030

6:19 And he smote 5221-55 the men 582 of Bethshemesh, 1053 because they had looked 7200-1 into the ark 727 of the LORD, 3068 even he smote 5221-55 of the people 5971 fifty 2572 thousand 505 and threescore 376 and ten 7657 men: 376 and the people 5971 lamented, 56-101 because the LORD 3068 had smitten 5221-52 [many] of the people 5971 with a great 1419 slaughter. 4347

6:20 And the men 582 of Bethshemesh 1053 said, 559-4 Who is able 3201-4 to stand 5975-2 before 6440 this holy 6918 LORD 3068 God? 430 and to whom shall he go up 5927-4 from us?

6:21 And they sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 to the inhabitants 3427-6 of Kirjathjearim, 7157 saying, 559-2 The Philistines 6430 have brought again 7725-52 the ark 727 of the LORD; 3068 come ye down, 3381-3 [and] fetch it up 5927-54 to you.

7:1 And the men 582 of Kirjathjearim 7157 came, 935-4 and fetched up 5927-55 the ark 727 of the LORD, 3068 and brought 935-55 it into the house 1004 of Abinadab 41 in the hill, 1389|1390 and sanctified 6942-14 Eleazar 499 his son 1121 to keep 8104-2 the ark 727 of the LORD. 3068

7:2 And it came to pass, while 3117 the ark 727 abode 3427-2 in Kirjathjearim, 7157 that the time 3117 was long; 7235-4 for it was twenty 6242 years: 8141 and all the house 1004 of Israel 3478 lamented 5091-11 after 310 the LORD. 3068

7:3 And Samuel 8050 spake 559-4 unto all the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 If ye do return 7725-6 unto the LORD 3068 with all your hearts, 3824 [then] put away 5493-54 the strange 5236 gods 430 and Ashtaroth 6252 from among 8432 you, and prepare 3559-54 your hearts 3824 unto the LORD, 3068 and serve 5647-3 him only: and he will deliver 5337-55 you out of the hand 3027 of the Philistines. 6430

7:4 Then the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did put away 5493-55 Baalim 1168 and Ashtaroth, 6252 and served 5647-4 the LORD 3068 only.

7:5 And Samuel 8050 said, 559-4 Gather 6908-3 all Israel 3478 to Mizpeh, 4708 and I will pray 6419-101 for you unto the LORD. 3068

7:6 And they gathered together 6908-11 to Mizpeh, 4709 and drew 7579-4 water, 4325 and poured [it] out 8210-4 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and fasted 6684-4 on that day, 3117 and said 559-4 there, We have sinned 2398-1 against the LORD. 3068 And Samuel 8050 judged 8199-4 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 in Mizpeh. 4708

7:7 And when the Philistines 6430 heard 8085-4 that the children 1121 of Israel 3478 were gathered together 6908-98 to Mizpeh, 4708 the lords 5633 of the Philistines 6430 went up 5927-4 against Israel. 3478 And when the children 1121 of Israel 3478 heard 8085-4 [it], they were afraid 3372-4 of 6440 the Philistines. 6430

7:8 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 said 559-4 to Samuel, 8050 Cease 2790-55 not to cry 2199-2 unto the LORD 3068 our God 430 for us, that he will save 3467-55 us out of the hand 3027 of the Philistines. 6430

7:9 And Samuel 8050 took 3947-4 a 259 sucking 2461 lamb, 2924 and offered 5927-55 [it for] a burnt offering 5930 wholly 3632 unto the LORD: 3068 and Samuel 8050 cried 2199-4 unto the LORD 3068 for Israel; 3478 and the LORD 3068 heard 6030-4 him.

7:10 And as Samuel 8050 was offering up 5927-56 the burnt offering, 5930 the Philistines 6430 drew near 5066-8 to battle 4421 against Israel: 3478 but the LORD 3068 thundered 7481-55 with a great 1419 thunder 6963 on that day 3117 upon the Philistines, 6430 and discomfited 2000-4 them; and they were smitten 5062-11 before 6440 Israel. 3478

7:11 And the men 582 of Israel 3478 went out 3318-4 of Mizpeh, 4709 and pursued 7291-4 the Philistines, 6430 and smote 5221-55 them, until [they came] under Bethcar. 1033

7:12 Then Samuel 8050 took 3947-4 a 259 stone, 68 and set 7760-4 [it] between Mizpeh 4709 and Shen, 8129 and called 7121-4 the name 8034 of it Ebenezer, 72 saying, 559-4 Hitherto hath the LORD 3068 helped 5826-1 us.

7:13 So the Philistines 6430 were subdued, 3665-11 and they came 935-2 no more 3254-1 into the coast 1366 of Israel: 3478 and the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 was against the Philistines 6430 all the days 3117 of Samuel. 8050

7:14 And the cities 5892 which the Philistines 6430 had taken 3947-1 from Israel 3478 were restored 7725-4 to Israel, 3478 from Ekron 6138 even unto Gath; 1661 and the coasts 1366 thereof did Israel 3478 deliver 5337-52 out of the hands 3027 of the Philistines. 6430 And there was peace 7965 between Israel 3478 and the Amorites. 567

7:15 And Samuel 8050 judged 8199-4 Israel 3478 all the days 3117 of his life. 2416

7:16 And he went 1980-1 from 1767 year 8141 to year 8141 in circuit 5437-1 to Bethel, 1008 and Gilgal, 1537 and Mizpeh, 4709 and judged 8199-1 Israel 3478 in all those places. 4725

7:17 And his return 8666 [was] to Ramah; 7414 for there [was] his house; 1004 and there he judged 8199-1 Israel; 3478 and there he built 1129-4 an altar 4196 unto the LORD. 3068

8:1 And it came to pass, when Samuel 8050 was old, 2204-1 that he made 7760-4 his sons 1121 judges 8199-6 over Israel. 3478

8:2 Now the name 8034 of his firstborn 1121 1060 was Joel; 3100 and the name 8034 of his second, 4932 Abiah: 29 [they were] judges 8199-6 in Beersheba. 884

8:3 And his sons 1121 walked 1980-1 not in his ways, 1870 but turned aside 5186-4 after 310 lucre, 1215 and took 3947-4 bribes, 7810 and perverted 5186-55 judgment. 4941

8:4 Then all the elders 2205 of Israel 3478 gathered themselves together, 6908-101 and came 935-4 to Samuel 8050 unto Ramah, 7414

8:5 And said 559-4 unto him, Behold, thou art old, 2204-1 and thy sons 1121 walk 1980-1 not in thy ways: 1870 now make 7760-3 us a king 4428 to judge 8199-2 us like all the nations. 1471

8:6 But the thing 1697 displeased 3415-4 5869 Samuel, 8050 when they said, 559-1 Give 5414-3 us a king 4428 to judge 8199-2 us. And Samuel 8050 prayed 6419-101 unto the LORD. 3068

8:7 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Samuel, 8050 Hearken 8085-3 unto the voice 6963 of the people 5971 in all that they say 559-4 unto thee: for they have not rejected 3988-1 thee, but they have rejected 3988-1 me, that I should not reign 4427-2 over them.

8:8 According to all the works 4639 which they have done 6213-1 since the day 3117 that I brought them up 5927-53 out of Egypt 4714 even unto this day, 3117 wherewith they have forsaken 5800-4 me, and served 5647-4 other 312 gods, 430 so do 6213-6 they also unto thee.

8:9 Now therefore hearken 8085-3 unto their voice: 6963 howbeit 389 yet protest 5749-55 solemnly 5749-53 unto them, and shew 5046-52 them the manner 4941 of the king 4428 that shall reign 4427-4 over them.

8:10 And Samuel 8050 told 559-4 all the words 1697 of the LORD 3068 unto the people 5971 that asked 7592-6 of him a king. 4428

8:11 And he said, 559-4 This will be the manner 4941 of the king 4428 that shall reign 4427-4 over you: He will take 3947-4 your sons, 1121 and appoint 7760-1 [them] for himself, for his chariots, 4818 and [to be] his horsemen; 6571 and [some] shall run 7323-1 before 6440 his chariots. 4818

8:12 And he will appoint 7760-2 him captains 8269 over thousands, 505 and captains 8269 over fifties; 2572 and [will set them] to ear 2790-2 his ground, 2758 and to reap 7114-2 his harvest, 7105 and to make 6213-2 his instruments 3627 of war, 4421 and instruments 3627 of his chariots. 7393

8:13 And he will take 3947-4 your daughters 1323 [to be] confectionaries, 7548 and [to be] cooks, 2879 and [to be] bakers. 644-6

8:14 And he will take 3947-4 your fields, 7704 and your vineyards, 3754 and your oliveyards, 2132 [even] the best 2896 [of them], and give 5414-1 [them] to his servants. 5650

8:15 And he will take the tenth 6237-4 of your seed, 2233 and of your vineyards, 3754 and give 5414-1 to his officers, 5631 and to his servants. 5650

8:16 And he will take 3947-4 your menservants, 5650 and your maidservants, 8198 and your goodliest 2896 young men, 970 and your asses, 2543 and put 6213-1 [them] to his work. 4399

8:17 He will take the tenth 6237-4 of your sheep: 6629 and ye shall be his servants. 5650

8:18 And ye shall cry out 2199-1 in that day 3117 because 6440 of your king 4428 which ye shall have chosen 977-1 you; and the LORD 3068 will not hear 6030-4 you in that day. 3117

8:19 Nevertheless the people 5971 refused 3985-17 to obey 8085-2 the voice 6963 of Samuel; 8050 and they said, 559-4 Nay; but we will have a king 4428 over us;

8:20 That we also may be like all the nations; 1471 and that our king 4428 may judge 8199-1 us, and go out 3318-1 before 6440 us, and fight 3898-8 our battles. 4421

8:21 And Samuel 8050 heard 8085-4 all the words 1697 of the people, 5971 and he rehearsed 1696-17 them in the ears 241 of the LORD. 3068

8:22 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 to Samuel, 8050 Hearken 8085-3 unto their voice, 6963 and make 4427-52 them a king. 4428 And Samuel 8050 said 559-4 unto the men 582 of Israel, 3478 Go 3212-3 ye every man 376 unto his city. 5892

9:1 Now there was a man 376 of Benjamin, 1144 whose name 8034 [was] Kish, 7027 the son 1121 of Abiel, 22 the son 1121 of Zeror, 6872 the son 1121 of Bechorath, 1064 the son 1121 of Aphiah, 647 a Benjamite, 1121 3228 376 a mighty 1368 man of power. 2428

9:2 And he had a son, 1121 whose name 8034 [was] Saul, 7586 a choice young man, 970 and a goodly: 2896 and [there was] not among the children 1121 of Israel 3478 a goodlier 2896 person 376 than he: from his shoulders 7926 and upward 4605 [he was] higher 1364 than any of the people. 5971

9:3 And the asses 860 of Kish 7027 Saul's 7586 father 1 were lost. 6-4 And Kish 7027 said 559-4 to Saul 7586 his son, 1121 Take 3947-3 now one 259 of the servants 5288 with thee, and arise, 6965-3 go 3212-3 seek 1245-16 the asses. 860

9:4 And he passed 5674-4 through mount 2022 Ephraim, 669 and passed 5674-4 through the land 776 of Shalisha, 8031 but they found 4672-1 [them] not: then they passed 5674-4 through the land 776 of Shalim, 8171 and [there they were] not: and he passed 5674-4 through the land 776 of the Benjamites, 3228 but they found 4672-1 [them] not.

9:5 [And] when they were come 935-1 to the land 776 of Zuph, 6689 Saul 7586 said 559-1 to his servant 5288 that [was] with him, Come, 3212-3 and let us return; 7725-4 lest my father 1 leave 2308-4 [caring] for the asses, 860 and take thought 1672-1 for us.

9:6 And he said 559-4 unto him, Behold now, [there is] in this city 5892 a man 376 of God, 430 and [he is] an honourable 3513-12 man; 376 all that he saith 1696-17 cometh 935-4 surely to pass: 935-2 now let us go 3212-4 thither; peradventure he can shew 5046-55 us our way 1870 that we should go. 1980-1

9:7 Then said 559-4 Saul 7586 to his servant, 5288 But, behold, [if] we go, 3212-4 what shall we bring 935-55 the man? 376 for the bread 3899 is spent 235-1 in our vessels, 3627 and [there is] not a present 8670 to bring 935-53 to the man 376 of God: 430 what have we?

9:8 And the servant 5288 answered 6030-2 Saul 7586 again, 3254-55 and said, 559-4 Behold, I have here 4672-8 at hand 3027 the fourth 7253 part of a shekel 8255 of silver: 3701 [that] will I give 5414-1 to the man 376 of God, 430 to tell 5046-52 us our way. 1870

9:9 (Beforetime 6440 in Israel, 3478 when a man 376 went 3212-2 to enquire 1875-2 of God, 430 thus he spake, 559-1 Come, 3212-3 and let us go 3212-4 to the seer: 7200-6 for [he that is] now 3117 [called] a Prophet 5030 was beforetime 6440 called 7121-11 a Seer.) 7200-6

9:10 Then said 559-4 Saul 7586 to his servant, 5288 Well 2896 said; 1697 come, 3212-3 let us go. 3212-4 So they went 3212-4 unto the city 5892 where the man 376 of God 430 [was].

9:11 [And] as they went up 5927-6 the hill 4608 to the city, 5892 they found 4672-1 young maidens 5291 going out 3318-6 to draw 7579-2 water, 4325 and said 559-4 unto them, Is 3426 the seer 7200-6 here?

9:12 And they answered 6030-4 them, and said, 559-4 He is; 3426 behold, [he is] before 6440 you: make haste 4116-16 now, for he came 935-1 to day 3117 to the city; 5892 for [there is] a sacrifice 2077 of the people 5971 to day 3117 in the high place: 1116

9:13 As soon as ye be come 935-2 into the city, 5892 ye shall straightway 3651 find 4672-4 him, before he go up 5927-4 to the high place 1116 to eat: 398-2 for the people 5971 will not eat 398-4 until he come, 935-2 because he doth bless 1288-17 the sacrifice; 2077 [and] afterwards 310 3651 they eat 398-4 that be bidden. 7121-7 Now therefore get you up; 5927-3 for about this time 3117 ye shall find 4672-4 him.

9:14 And they went up 5927-4 into 8432 the city: 5892 [and] when they were come 935-6 into the city, 5892 behold, Samuel 8050 came out 3318-6 against 7125-2 them, for to go up 5927-2 to the high place. 1116

9:15 Now the LORD 3068 had told 1540-1 Samuel 8050 in his ear 241 a 259 day 3117 before 6440 Saul 7586 came, 935-2 saying, 559-2

9:16 To morrow 4279 about this time 6256 I will send 7971-4 thee a man 376 out of the land 776 of Benjamin, 1144 and thou shalt anoint 4886-1 him [to be] captain 5057 over my people 5971 Israel, 3478 that he may save 3467-52 my people 5971 out of the hand 3027 of the Philistines: 6430 for I have looked 7200-1 upon my people, 5971 because their cry 6818 is come 935-1 unto me.

9:17 And when Samuel 8050 saw 7200-1 Saul, 7586 the LORD 3068 said 6030-1 unto him, Behold the man 376 whom I spake 559-1 to thee of! this same shall reign 6113-4 over my people. 5971

9:18 Then Saul 7586 drew near 5066-4 to Samuel 8050 in 8432 the gate, 8179 and said, 559-4 Tell 5046-54 me, I pray thee, where 335 the seer's 7200-6 house 1004 [is].

9:19 And Samuel 8050 answered 6030-4 Saul, 7586 and said, 559-4 I [am] the seer: 7200-6 go up 5927-3 before 6440 me unto the high place; 1116 for ye shall eat 398-1 with me to day, 3117 and to morrow 1242 I will let thee go, 7971-14 and will tell 5046-55 thee all that [is] in thine heart. 3824

9:20 And as for thine asses 860 that were lost 6-6 three 7969 days 3117 ago, 3117 set 7760-4 not thy mind 3820 on them; for they are found. 4672-8 And on whom [is] all the desire 2532 of Israel? 3478 [Is it] not on thee, and on all thy father's 1 house? 1004

9:21 And Saul 7586 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 [Am] not I a Benjamite, 1145 of the smallest 6996 of the tribes 7626 of Israel? 3478 and my family 4940 the least 6810 of all the families 4940 of the tribe 7626 of Benjamin? 1144 wherefore then speakest 1696-14 thou so 1697 to me?

9:22 And Samuel 8050 took 3947-4 Saul 7586 and his servant, 5288 and brought 935-55 them into the parlour, 3957 and made 5414-4 them sit in the chiefest 7218 place 4725 among them that were bidden, 7121-7 which [were] about thirty 7970 persons. 376

9:23 And Samuel 8050 said 559-4 unto the cook, 2876 Bring 5414-3 the portion 4490 which I gave 5414-1 thee, of which I said 559-1 unto thee, Set 7760-3 it by thee.

9:24 And the cook 2876 took up 7311-55 the shoulder, 7785 and [that] which [was] upon it, and set 7760-4 [it] before 6440 Saul. 7586 And [Samuel] said, 559-4 Behold that which is left! 7604-12 set 7760-3 [it] before 6440 thee, [and] eat: 398-3 for unto this time 4150 hath it been kept 8104-7 for thee since I said, 559-2 I have invited 7121-1 the people. 5971 So Saul 7586 did eat 398-4 with Samuel 8050 that day. 3117

9:25 And when they were come down 3381-4 from the high place 1116 into the city, 5892 [Samuel] communed 1696-17 with Saul 7586 upon the top 1406 of the house.

9:26 And they arose early: 7925-55 and it came to pass about the spring 5927-2 of the day, 7837 that Samuel 8050 called 7121-4 Saul 7586 to the top 1406 of the house, saying, 559-2 Up, 6965-3 that I may send thee away. 7971-17 And Saul 7586 arose, 6965-4 and they went out 3318-4 both 8147 of them, he and Samuel, 8050 abroad. 2351

9:27 [And] as they were going down 3381-6 to the end 7097 of the city, 5892 Samuel 8050 said 559-1 to Saul, 7586 Bid 559-3 the servant 5288 pass on 5674-4 before 6440 us, (and he passed on,) 5674-4 but stand 5975-3 thou still a while, 3117 that I may shew 8085-55 thee the word 1697 of God. 430

10:1 Then Samuel 8050 took 3947-4 a vial 6378 of oil, 8081 and poured 3332-4 [it] upon his head, 7218 and kissed 5401-4 him, and said, 559-4 [Is it] not because the LORD 3068 hath anointed 4886-1 thee [to be] captain 5057 over his inheritance? 5159

10:2 When thou art departed 3212-2 from me 5978 to day, 3117 then thou shalt find 4672-1 two 8147 men 582 by Rachel's 7354 sepulchre 6900 in the border 1366 of Benjamin 1144 at Zelzah; 6766 and they will say 559-1 unto thee, The asses 860 which thou wentest 1980-1 to seek 1245-15 are found: 4672-8 and, lo, thy father 1 hath left 5203-1 the care 1697 of the asses, 860 and sorroweth 1672-1 for you, saying, 559-2 What shall I do 6213-4 for my son? 1121

10:3 Then shalt thou go on 2498-1 forward 1973 from thence, and thou shalt come 935-1 to the plain 436 of Tabor, 8396 and there shall meet 4672-1 thee three 7969 men 582 going up 5927-6 to God 430 to Bethel, 1008 one 259 carrying 5375-6 three 7969 kids, 1423 and another 259 carrying 5375-6 three 7969 loaves 3603 of bread, 3899 and another 259 carrying 5375-6 a bottle 5035 of wine: 3196

10:4 And they will 7592-1 salute 7965 thee, and give 5414-1 thee two 8147 [loaves] of bread; 3899 which thou shalt receive 3947-1 of their hands. 3027

10:5 After 310 that thou shalt come 935-4 to the hill 1389 of God, 430 where [is] the garrison 5333 of the Philistines: 6430 and it shall come to pass, when thou art come 935-2 thither to the city, 5892 that thou shalt meet 6293-1 a company 2256 of prophets 5030 coming down 3381-6 from the high place 1116 with a psaltery, 5035 and a tabret, 8596 and a pipe, 2485 and a harp, 3658 before 6440 them; and they shall prophesy: 5012-102

10:6 And the Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 will come 6743-1 upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy 5012-98 with them, and shalt be turned 2015-8 into another 312 man. 376

10:7 And let it be, when these signs 226 are come 935-4 unto thee, [that] thou do 6213-3 as occasion 4672-4 serve thee; 3027 for God 430 [is] with thee.

10:8 And thou shalt go down 3381-1 before 6440 me to Gilgal; 1537 and, behold, I will come down 3381-6 unto thee, to offer 5927-53 burnt offerings, 5930 [and] to sacrifice 2076-2 sacrifices 2077 of peace offerings: 8002 seven 7651 days 3117 shalt thou tarry, 3176-55 till I come 935-2 to thee, and shew 3045-52 thee what thou shalt do. 6213-4

10:9 And it was [so], that when he had turned 6437-53 his back 7926 to go 3212-2 from Samuel, 8050 God 430 gave 2015-4 him another 312 heart: 3820 and all those signs 226 came to pass 935-4 that day. 3117

10:10 And when they came 935-4 thither to the hill, 1389|1390 behold, a company 2256 of prophets 5030 met 7125-2 him; and the Spirit 7307 of God 430 came 6743-4 upon him, and he prophesied 5012-101 among 8432 them.

10:11 And it came to pass, when all that knew 3045-6 him beforetime 865 8032 saw 7200-4 that, behold, he prophesied 5012-8 among the prophets, 5030 then the people 5971 said 559-4 one 376 to another, 7453 What [is] this [that] is come unto the son 1121 of Kish? 7027 [Is] Saul 7586 also among the prophets? 5030

10:12 And one 376 of the same place answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 But who [is] their father? 1 Therefore it became a proverb, 4912 [Is] Saul 7586 also among the prophets? 5030

10:13 And when he had made an end 3615-17 of prophesying, 5012-99 he came 935-4 to the high place. 1116

10:14 And Saul's 7586 uncle 1730 said 559-4 unto him and to his servant, 5288 Whither 575 went 1980-1 ye? And he said, 559-4 To seek 1245-15 the asses: 860 and when we saw 7200-4 that [they were] no where, 369 we came 935-4 to Samuel. 8050

10:15 And Saul's 7586 uncle 1730 said, 559-4 Tell 5046-54 me, I pray thee, what Samuel 8050 said 559-1 unto you.

10:16 And Saul 7586 said 559-4 unto his uncle, 1730 He told 5046-52 us plainly 5046-53 that the asses 860 were found. 4672-8 But of the matter 1697 of the kingdom, 4410 whereof Samuel 8050 spake, 559-1 he told 5046-52 him not.

10:17 And Samuel 8050 called 6817-55 the people 5971 together unto the LORD 3068 to Mizpeh; 4709

10:18 And said 559-4 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 I brought up 5927-52 Israel 3478 out of Egypt, 4714 and delivered 5337-55 you out of the hand 3027 of the Egyptians, 4714 and out of the hand 3027 of all kingdoms, 4467 [and] of them that oppressed 3905-5 you:

10:19 And ye have this day 3117 rejected 3988-1 your God, 430 who himself saved 3467-56 you out of all your adversities 7451 and your tribulations; 6869 and ye have said 559-4 unto him, [Nay], but set 7760-4 a king 4428 over us. Now therefore present 3320-100 yourselves before 6440 the LORD 3068 by your tribes, 7626 and by your thousands. 505

10:20 And when Samuel 8050 had caused all the tribes 7626 of Israel 3478 to come near, 7126-55 the tribe 7626 of Benjamin 1144 was taken. 3920-11

10:21 When he had caused the tribe 7626 of Benjamin 1144 to come near 7126-55 by their families, 4940 the family 4940 of Matri 4309 was taken, 3920-11 and Saul 7586 the son 1121 of Kish 7027 was taken: 3920-11 and when they sought 1245-17 him, he could not be found. 4672-8

10:22 Therefore they enquired 7592-4 of the LORD 3068 further, if the man 376 should yet come 935-1 thither. 1988 And the LORD 3068 answered, 559-4 Behold, he hath hid 2244-12 himself among the stuff. 3627

10:23 And they ran 7323-4 and fetched 3947-4 him thence: and when he stood 3320-101 among 8432 the people, 5971 he was higher 1361-4 than any of the people 5971 from his shoulders 7926 and upward. 4605

10:24 And Samuel 8050 said 559-4 to all the people, 5971 See 7200-1 ye him whom the LORD 3068 hath chosen, 977-1 that [there is] none like him among all the people? 5971 And all the people 5971 shouted, 7321-55 and said, 559-4 God save 2421-4 the king. 4428

10:25 Then Samuel 8050 told 1696-17 the people 5971 the manner 4941 of the kingdom, 4410 and wrote 3789-4 [it] in a book, 5612 and laid [it] up 3240-55 before 6440 the LORD. 3068 And Samuel 8050 sent all the people 5971 away, 7971-17 every man 376 to his house. 1004

10:26 And Saul 7586 also went 1980-1 home 1004 to Gibeah; 1390 and there went 3212-4 with him a band of men, 2428 whose hearts 3820 God 430 had touched. 5060-1

10:27 But the children 1121 of Belial 1100 said, 559-1 How shall this man save 3467-55 us? And they despised 959-4 him, and brought 935-52 him no presents. 4503 But he held his peace. 2790-56

11:1 Then Nahash 5176 the Ammonite 5984 came up, 5927-4 and encamped 2583-4 against Jabeshgilead: 3003 1568 and all the men 582 of Jabesh 3003 said 559-4 unto Nahash, 5176 Make 3772-3 a covenant 1285 with us, and we will serve 5647-4 thee.

11:2 And Nahash 5176 the Ammonite 5984 answered 559-4 them, On this 2063 [condition] will I make 3772-4 [a covenant] with you, that I may thrust out 5365-2 all your right 3225 eyes, 5869 and lay 7760-1 it [for] a reproach 2781 upon all Israel. 3478

11:3 And the elders 2205 of Jabesh 3003 said 559-4 unto him, Give us seven 7651 days' 3117 respite, 7503-54 that we may send 7971-4 messengers 4397 unto all the coasts 1366 of Israel: 3478 and then, if [there be] no man to save 3467-56 us, we will come out 3318-1 to thee.

11:4 Then came 935-4 the messengers 4397 to Gibeah 1390 of Saul, 7586 and told 1696-17 the tidings 1697 in the ears 241 of the people: 5971 and all the people 5971 lifted up 5375-4 their voices, 6963 and wept. 1058-4

11:5 And, behold, Saul 7586 came 935-1 after 310 the herd 1241 out of the field; 7704 and Saul 7586 said, 559-4 What [aileth] the people 5971 that they weep? 1058-4 And they told 5608-17 him the tidings 1697 of the men 582 of Jabesh. 3003

11:6 And the Spirit 7307 of God 430 came 6743-4 upon Saul 7586 when he heard 8085-2 those tidings, 1697 and his anger 639 was kindled 2734-4 greatly. 3966

11:7 And he took 3947-4 a yoke 6776 of oxen, 1241 and hewed them in pieces, 5408-17 and sent 7971-17 [them] throughout all the coasts 1366 of Israel 3478 by the hands 3027 of messengers, 4397 saying, 559-2 Whosoever cometh not forth 3318-6 after 310 Saul 7586 and after 310 Samuel, 8050 so shall it be done 6213-11 unto his oxen. 1241 And the fear 6343 of the LORD 3068 fell 5307-4 on the people, 5971 and they came out 3318-4 with one 259 consent. 376

11:8 And when he numbered 6485-4 them in Bezek, 966 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 were three 7969 hundred 3967 thousand, 505 and the men 376 of Judah 3063 thirty 7970 thousand. 505

11:9 And they said 559-4 unto the messengers 4397 that came, 935-6 Thus shall ye say 559-4 unto the men 376 of Jabeshgilead, 3003 1568 To morrow, 4279 by [that time] the sun 8121 be hot, 2527 ye shall have help. 8668 And the messengers 4397 came 935-4 and shewed 5046-55 [it] to the men 582 of Jabesh; 3003 and they were glad. 8055-4

11:10 Therefore the men 582 of Jabesh 3003 said, 559-4 To morrow 4279 we will come out 3318-4 unto you, and ye shall do 6213-1 with us all that seemeth 5869 good 2896 unto you.

11:11 And it was [so] on the morrow, 4283 that Saul 7586 put 7760-4 the people 5971 in three 7969 companies; 7218 and they came 935-4 into the midst 8432 of the host 4264 in the morning 1242 watch, 821 and slew 5221-55 the Ammonites 5983 until the heat 2527 of the day: 3117 and it came to pass, that they which remained 7604-12 were scattered, 6327-4 so that two 8147 of them were not left 7604-8 together. 3162

11:12 And the people 5971 said 559-4 unto Samuel, 8050 Who [is] he that said, 559-6 Shall Saul 7586 reign 4427-4 over us? bring 5414-3 the men, 582 that we may put them to death. 4191-55

11:13 And Saul 7586 said, 559-4 There shall not a man 376 be put to death 4191-93 this day: 3117 for to day 3117 the LORD 3068 hath wrought 6213-1 salvation 8668 in Israel. 3478

11:14 Then said 559-4 Samuel 8050 to the people, 5971 Come, 3212-3 and let us go 3212-4 to Gilgal, 1537 and renew 2318-17 the kingdom 4410 there.

11:15 And all the people 5971 went 3212-4 to Gilgal; 1537 and there they made Saul 7586 king 4427-55 before 6440 the LORD 3068 in Gilgal; 1537 and there they sacrificed 2076-4 sacrifices 2077 of peace offerings 8002 before 6440 the LORD; 3068 and there Saul 7586 and all the men 582 of Israel 3478 rejoiced 8055-4 greatly. 3966

12:1 And Samuel 8050 said 559-4 unto all Israel, 3478 Behold, I have hearkened 8085-1 unto your voice 6963 in all that ye said 559-1 unto me, and have made 4427-55 a king 4428 over you.

12:2 And now, behold, the king 4428 walketh 1980-102 before 6440 you: and I am old 2204-1 and grayheaded; 7867-1 and, behold, my sons 1121 [are] with you: and I have walked 1980-98 before 6440 you from my childhood 5271 unto this day. 3117

12:3 Behold, here I [am]: witness 6030-3 against me before the LORD, 3068 and before his anointed: 4899 whose ox 7794 have I taken? 3947-1 or whose ass 2543 have I taken? 3947-1 or whom have I defrauded? 6231-1 whom have I oppressed? 7533-1 or of whose hand 3027 have I received 3947-1 [any] bribe 3724 to blind 5956-55 mine eyes 5869 therewith? and I will restore 7725-55 it you.

12:4 And they said, 559-4 Thou hast not defrauded 6231-1 us, nor oppressed 7533-1 us, neither hast thou taken 3947-1 ought 3972 of any man's 376 hand. 3027

12:5 And he said 559-4 unto them, The LORD 3068 [is] witness 5707 against you, and his anointed 4899 [is] witness 5707 this day, 3117 that ye have not found 4672-1 ought 3972 in my hand. 3027 And they answered, 559-4 [He is] witness. 5707

12:6 And Samuel 8050 said 559-4 unto the people, 5971 [It is] the LORD 3068 that advanced 6213-1 Moses 4872 and Aaron, 175 and that brought 5927-52 your fathers 1 up out of the land 776 of Egypt. 4714

12:7 Now therefore stand still, 3320-100 that I may reason 8199-11 with you before 6440 the LORD 3068 of all the righteous acts 6666 of the LORD, 3068 which he did 6213-1 to you and to your fathers. 1

12:8 When Jacob 3290 was come 935-1 into Egypt, 4714 and your fathers 1 cried 2199-4 unto the LORD, 3068 then the LORD 3068 sent 7971-4 Moses 4872 and Aaron, 175 which brought forth 3318-55 your fathers 1 out of Egypt, 4714 and made them dwell 3427-55 in this place. 4725

12:9 And when they forgat 7911-4 the LORD 3068 their God, 430 he sold 4376-4 them into the hand 3027 of Sisera, 5516 captain 8269 of the host 6635 of Hazor, 2674 and into the hand 3027 of the Philistines, 6430 and into the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Moab, 4124 and they fought 3898-11 against them.

12:10 And they cried 2199-4 unto the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 We have sinned, 2398-1 because we have forsaken 5800-1 the LORD, 3068 and have served 5647-4 Baalim 1168 and Ashtaroth: 6252 but now deliver 5337-54 us out of the hand 3027 of our enemies, 341-6 and we will serve 5647-4 thee.

12:11 And the LORD 3068 sent 7971-4 Jerubbaal, 3378 and Bedan, 917 and Jephthah, 3316 and Samuel, 8050 and delivered 5337-55 you out of the hand 3027 of your enemies 341-6 on every side, 5439 and ye dwelled 3427-4 safe. 983

12:12 And when ye saw 7200-4 that Nahash 5176 the king 4428 of the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 came 935-1 against you, ye said 559-4 unto me, Nay; but a king 4428 shall reign 4427-4 over us: when the LORD 3068 your God 430 [was] your king. 4428

12:13 Now therefore behold the king 4428 whom ye have chosen, 977-1 [and] whom ye have desired! 7592-1 and, behold, the LORD 3068 hath set 5414-1 a king 4428 over you.

12:14 If ye will fear 3372-4 the LORD, 3068 and serve 5647-1 him, and obey 8085-1 his voice, 6963 and not rebel 4784-55 against the commandment 6310 of the LORD, 3068 then shall both ye and also the king 4428 that reigneth 4427-1 over you continue following 310 the LORD 3068 your God: 430

12:15 But if ye will not obey 8085-4 the voice 6963 of the LORD, 3068 but rebel 4784-1 against the commandment 6310 of the LORD, 3068 then shall the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 be against you, as [it was] against your fathers. 1

12:16 Now therefore 1571 stand 3320-100 and see 7200-3 this great 1419 thing, 1697 which the LORD 3068 will do 6213-6 before your eyes. 5869

12:17 [Is it] not wheat 2406 harvest 7105 to day? 3117 I will call 7121-4 unto the LORD, 3068 and he shall send 5414-4 thunder 6963 and rain; 4306 that ye may perceive 3045-3 and see 7200-3 that your wickedness 7451 [is] great, 7227 which ye have done 6213-1 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 in asking 7592-2 you a king. 4428

12:18 So Samuel 8050 called 7121-4 unto the LORD; 3068 and the LORD 3068 sent 5414-4 thunder 6963 and rain 4306 that day: 3117 and all the people 5971 greatly 3966 feared 3372-4 the LORD 3068 and Samuel. 8050

12:19 And all the people 5971 said 559-4 unto Samuel, 8050 Pray 6419-100 for thy servants 5650 unto the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 that we die 4191-4 not: for we have added 3254-1 unto all our sins 2403 [this] evil, 7451 to ask 7592-2 us a king. 4428

12:20 And Samuel 8050 said 559-4 unto the people, 5971 Fear 3372-4 not: ye have done 6213-1 all this wickedness: 7451 yet turn not aside 5493-4 from following 310 the LORD, 3068 but serve 5647-1 the LORD 3068 with all your heart; 3824

12:21 And turn ye not aside: 5493-4 for [then should ye go] after 310 vain 8414 [things], which cannot profit 3276-55 nor deliver; 5337-55 for they [are] vain. 8414

12:22 For the LORD 3068 will not forsake 5203-4 his people 5971 for his great 1419 name's 8034 sake: because it hath pleased 2974-52 the LORD 3068 to make 6213-2 you his people. 5971

12:23 Moreover as for me, 595 God forbid 2486 that I should sin 2398-2 against the LORD 3068 in ceasing 2308-2 to pray 6419-99 for you: but I will teach 3384-52 you the good 2896 and the right 3477 way: 1870

12:24 Only fear 3372-3 the LORD, 3068 and serve 5647-1 him in truth 571 with all your heart: 3824 for consider 7200-3 how great [things] he hath done 1431-52 for you.

12:25 But if ye shall still 7489-53 do wickedly, 7489-55 ye shall be consumed, 5595-11 both ye and your king. 4428

13:1 Saul 7586 reigned 4427-2 one year; 1121 8141 and when he had reigned 4427-1 two 8147 years 8141 over Israel, 3478

13:2 Saul 7586 chose 977-4 him three 7969 thousand 505 [men] of Israel; 3478 [whereof] two thousand 505 were with Saul 7586 in Michmash 4363 and in mount 2022 Bethel, 1008 and a thousand 505 were with Jonathan 3129 in Gibeah 1390 of Benjamin: 1144 and the rest 3499 of the people 5971 he sent 7971-14 every man 376 to his tent. 168

13:3 And Jonathan 3129 smote 5221-55 the garrison 5333 of the Philistines 6430 that [was] in Geba, 1387 and the Philistines 6430 heard 8085-4 [of it]. And Saul 7586 blew 8628-1 the trumpet 7782 throughout all the land, 776 saying, 559-2 Let the Hebrews 5680 hear. 8085-4

13:4 And all Israel 3478 heard 8085-1 say 559-2 [that] Saul 7586 had smitten 5221-52 a garrison 5333 of the Philistines, 6430 and [that] Israel 3478 also was had in abomination 887-8 with the Philistines. 6430 And the people 5971 were called together 6817-11 after 310 Saul 7586 to Gilgal. 1537

13:5 And the Philistines 6430 gathered 622-8 themselves together to fight 3898-9 with Israel, 3478 thirty 7970 thousand 505 chariots, 7393 and six 8337 thousand 505 horsemen, 6571 and people 5971 as the sand 2344 which [is] on the sea 3220 shore 8193 in multitude: 7230 and they came up, 5927-4 and pitched 2583-4 in Michmash, 4363 eastward 6926 from Bethaven. 1007

13:6 When the men 376 of Israel 3478 saw 7200-1 that they were in a strait, 6887-1 (for the people 5971 were distressed,) 5065-8 then the people 5971 did hide 2244-101 themselves in caves, 4631 and in thickets, 2337 and in rocks, 5553 and in high places, 6877 and in pits. 953

13:7 And [some of] the Hebrews 5680 went over 5674-1 Jordan 3383 to the land 776 of Gad 1410 and Gilead. 1568 As for Saul, 7586 he [was] yet in Gilgal, 1537 and all the people 5971 followed 310 him trembling. 2729-1

13:8 And he tarried 3176-55|3176-11-k seven 7651 days, 3117 according to the set time 4150 that Samuel 8050 [had appointed]: but Samuel 8050 came 935-1 not to Gilgal; 1537 and the people 5971 were scattered 6327-55 from him.

13:9 And Saul 7586 said, 559-4 Bring hither 5066-54 a burnt offering 5930 to me, and peace offerings. 8002 And he offered 5927-55 the burnt offering. 5930

13:10 And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end 3615-15 of offering 5927-53 the burnt offering, 5930 behold, Samuel 8050 came; 935-6 and Saul 7586 went out 3318-4 to meet 7125-2 him, that he might salute 1288-2 him.

13:11 And Samuel 8050 said, 559-4 What hast thou done? 6213-1 And Saul 7586 said, 559-4 Because I saw 7200-1 that the people 5971 were scattered 5310-1 from me, and [that] thou camest 935-1 not within the days 3117 appointed, 4150 and [that] the Philistines 6430 gathered 622-12 themselves together at Michmash; 4363

13:12 Therefore said 559-4 I, The Philistines 6430 will come down 3381-4 now upon me to Gilgal, 1537 and I have not made supplication 2470-14 unto 6440 the LORD: 3068 I forced 662-101 myself therefore, and offered 5927-55 a burnt offering. 5930

13:13 And Samuel 8050 said 559-4 to Saul, 7586 Thou hast done foolishly: 5528-8 thou hast not kept 8104-1 the commandment 4687 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 which he commanded 6680-14 thee: for now would the LORD 3068 have established 3559-52 thy kingdom 4467 upon Israel 3478 for 5704 ever. 5769

13:14 But now thy kingdom 4467 shall not continue: 6965-4 the LORD 3068 hath sought 1245-14 him a man 376 after his own heart, 3824 and the LORD 3068 hath commanded 6680-17 him [to be] captain 5057 over his people, 5971 because thou hast not kept 8104-1 [that] which the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 thee.

13:15 And Samuel 8050 arose, 6965-4 and gat him up 5927-4 from Gilgal 1537 unto Gibeah 1390 of Benjamin. 1144 And Saul 7586 numbered 6485-4 the people 5971 [that were] present 4672-12 with him, about six 8337 hundred 3967 men. 376

13:16 And Saul, 7586 and Jonathan 3129 his son, 1121 and the people 5971 [that were] present 4672-12 with them, abode 3427-6 in Gibeah 1387 of Benjamin: 1144 but the Philistines 6430 encamped 2583-1 in Michmash. 4363

13:17 And the spoilers 7843-56 came out 3318-4 of the camp 4264 of the Philistines 6430 in three 7969 companies: 7218 one 259 company 7218 turned 6437-4 unto the way 1870 [that leadeth to] Ophrah, 6084 unto the land 776 of Shual: 7777

13:18 And another 259 company 7218 turned 6437-4 the way 1870 [to] Bethhoron: 1032 and another 259 company 7218 turned 6437-4 [to] the way 1870 of the border 1366 that looketh 8259-12 to the valley 1516 of Zeboim 6650 toward the wilderness. 4057

13:19 Now there was no smith 2796 found 4672-11 throughout all the land 776 of Israel: 3478 for the Philistines 6430 said, 559-1 Lest the Hebrews 5680 make 6213-4 [them] swords 2719 or spears: 2595

13:20 But all the Israelites 3478 went down 3381-4 to the Philistines, 6430 to sharpen 3913-2 every man 376 his share, 4282 and his coulter, 855 and his axe, 7134 and his mattock. 4281

13:21 Yet they had a file 6477 6310 for the mattocks, 4281 and for the coulters, 855 and for the forks, 7969 7053 and for the axes, 7134 and to sharpen 5324-53 the goads. 1861

13:22 So it came to pass in the day 3117 of battle, 4421 that there was neither sword 2719 nor spear 2595 found 4672-8 in the hand 3027 of any of the people 5971 that [were] with Saul 7586 and Jonathan: 3129 but with Saul 7586 and with Jonathan 3129 his son 1121 was there found. 4672-11

13:23 And the garrison 4673 of the Philistines 6430 went out 3318-4 to the passage 4569 of Michmash. 4363

14:1 Now it came to pass upon a day, 3117 that Jonathan 3129 the son 1121 of Saul 7586 said 559-4 unto the young man 5288 that bare 5375-6 his armour, 3627 Come, 3212-3 and let us go over 5674-4 to the Philistines' 6430 garrison, 4673 that [is] on the other side. 5676 1975 But he told 5046-52 not his father. 1

14:2 And Saul 7586 tarried 3427-6 in the uttermost part 7097 of Gibeah 1390 under a pomegranate tree 7416 which [is] in Migron: 4051 and the people 5971 that [were] with him [were] about six 8337 hundred 3967 men; 376

14:3 And Ahiah, 281 the son 1121 of Ahitub, 285 Ichabod's 350 brother, 251 the son 1121 of Phinehas, 6372 the son 1121 of Eli, 5941 the LORD'S 3068 priest 3548 in Shiloh, 7887 wearing 5375-6 an ephod. 646 And the people 5971 knew 3045-1 not that Jonathan 3129 was gone. 1980-1

14:4 And between the passages, 4569 by which Jonathan 3129 sought 1245-14 to go over 5674-2 unto the Philistines' 6430 garrison, 4673 [there was] a sharp 8127 rock 5553 on the one side, 5676 and a sharp 8127 rock 5553 on the other side: 5676 and the name 8034 of the one 259 [was] Bozez, 949 and the name 8034 of the other 259 Seneh. 5573

14:5 The forefront 8127 of the one 259 [was] situate 4690 northward 6828 over against 4136 Michmash, 4363 and the other 259 southward 5045 over against 4136 Gibeah. 1387

14:6 And Jonathan 3083 said 559-4 to the young man 5288 that bare 5375-6 his armour, 3627 Come, 3212-3 and let us go over 5674-4 unto the garrison 4673 of these uncircumcised: 6189 it may be that the LORD 3068 will work 6213-4 for us: for [there is] no restraint 4622 to the LORD 3068 to save 3467-53 by many 7227 or by few. 4592

14:7 And his armourbearer 5375-6 3627 said 559-4 unto him, Do 6213-3 all that [is] in thine heart: 3824 turn 5186-3 thee; behold, I [am] with thee according to thy heart. 3824

14:8 Then said 559-4 Jonathan, 3083 Behold, we will pass over 5674-6 unto [these] men, 582 and we will discover 1540-8 ourselves unto them.

14:9 If they say 559-4 thus unto us, Tarry 1826-3 until we come 5060-53 to you; then we will stand still 5975-1 in our place, and will not go up 5927-4 unto them.

14:10 But if they say 559-4 thus, Come up 5927-3 unto us; then we will go up: 5927-1 for the LORD 3068 hath delivered 5414-1 them into our hand: 3027 and this [shall be] a sign 226 unto us.

14:11 And both 8147 of them discovered 1540-11 themselves unto the garrison 4673 of the Philistines: 6430 and the Philistines 6430 said, 559-4 Behold, the Hebrews 5680 come forth 3318-6 out of the holes 2356 where they had hid 2244-98 themselves.

14:12 And the men 582 of the garrison 4675 answered 6030-4 Jonathan 3129 and his armourbearer, 5375-6 3627 and said, 559-4 Come up 5927-3 to us, and we will shew 3045-55 you a thing. 1697 And Jonathan 3129 said 559-4 unto his armourbearer, 5375-6 3627 Come up 5927-3 after 310 me: for the LORD 3068 hath delivered 5414-1 them into the hand 3027 of Israel. 3478

14:13 And Jonathan 3129 climbed up 5927-4 upon his hands 3027 and upon his feet, 7272 and his armourbearer 5375-6 3627 after 310 him: and they fell 5307-4 before 6440 Jonathan; 3129 and his armourbearer 5375-6 3627 slew 4191-35 after 310 him.

14:14 And that first 7223 slaughter, 4347 which Jonathan 3129 and his armourbearer 5375-6 3627 made, 5221-52 was about twenty 6242 men, 376 within as it were an half 2677 acre 4618 of land, 7704 [which] a yoke 6776 [of oxen might plow].

14:15 And there was trembling 2731 in the host, 4264 in the field, 7704 and among all the people: 5971 the garrison, 4673 and the spoilers, 7843-56 they also trembled, 2729-1 and the earth 776 quaked: 7264-4 so it was a very great 430 trembling. 2731

14:16 And the watchmen 6822-6 of Saul 7586 in Gibeah 1390 of Benjamin 1144 looked; 7200-4 and, behold, the multitude 1995 melted away, 4127-8 and they went 3212-4 on beating down 1986-2 [one another].

14:17 Then said 559-4 Saul 7586 unto the people 5971 that [were] with him, Number 6485-3 now, and see 7200-3 who is gone 1980-1 from us. And when they had numbered, 6485-4 behold, Jonathan 3129 and his armourbearer 5375-6 3627 [were] not [there].

14:18 And Saul 7586 said 559-4 unto Ahiah, 281 Bring hither 5066-54 the ark 727 of God. 430 For the ark 727 of God 430 was at that time 3117 with the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

14:19 And it came to pass, while Saul 7586 talked 1696-14 unto the priest, 3548 that the noise 1995 that [was] in the host 4264 of the Philistines 6430 went 3212-4 on 1980-2 and increased: 7227 and Saul 7586 said 559-4 unto the priest, 3548 Withdraw 622-3 thine hand. 3027

14:20 And Saul 7586 and all the people 5971 that [were] with him assembled 2199-11 themselves, and they came 935-4 to the battle: 4421 and, behold, every man's 376 sword 2719 was against his fellow, 7453 [and there was] a very 3966 great 1419 discomfiture. 4103

14:21 Moreover the Hebrews 5680 [that] were with the Philistines 6430 before 865 that time, 8032 which went up 5927-1 with them into the camp 4264 [from the country] round about, 5439 even they also [turned] to be with the Israelites 3478 that [were] with Saul 7586 and Jonathan. 3129

14:22 Likewise all the men 376 of Israel 3478 which had hid 2244-102 themselves in mount 2022 Ephraim, 669 [when] they heard 8085-1 that the Philistines 6430 fled, 5127-1 even they also followed hard 1692-55 after 310 them in the battle. 4421

14:23 So the LORD 3068 saved 3467-55 Israel 3478 that day: 3117 and the battle 4421 passed over 5674-1 unto Bethaven. 1007

14:24 And the men 376 of Israel 3478 were distressed 5065-8 that day: 3117 for Saul 7586 had adjured 422-55 the people, 5971 saying, 559-2 Cursed 779-7 [be] the man 376 that eateth 398-4 [any] food 3899 until evening, 6153 that I may be avenged 5358-8 on mine enemies. 341-6 So none of the people 5971 tasted 2938-1 [any] food. 3899

14:25 And all [they of] the land 776 came 935-1 to a wood; 3293 and there was honey 1706 upon 6440 the ground. 7704

14:26 And when the people 5971 were come 935-4 into the wood, 3293 behold, the honey 1706 dropped; 1982 but no man put 5381-56 his hand 3027 to his mouth: 6310 for the people 5971 feared 3372-1 the oath. 7621

14:27 But Jonathan 3129 heard 8085-1 not when his father 1 charged the people 5971 with the oath: 7650-53 wherefore he put forth 7971-4 the end 7097 of the rod 4294 that [was] in his hand, 3027 and dipped 2881-4 it in an honeycomb, 3295 1706 and put 7725-55 his hand 3027 to his mouth; 6310 and his eyes 5869 were enlightened. 215-4-q

14:28 Then answered 6030-4 one 376 of the people, 5971 and said, 559-4 Thy father 1 straitly 7650-53 charged the people 5971 with an oath, 7650-52 saying, 559-2 Cursed 779-7 [be] the man 376 that eateth 398-4 [any] food 3899 this day. 3117 And the people 5971 were faint. 5774-4

14:29 Then said 559-4 Jonathan, 3129 My father 1 hath troubled 5916-1 the land: 776 see, 7200-3 I pray you, how mine eyes 5869 have been enlightened, 215-1 because I tasted 2938-1 a little 4592 of this honey. 1706

14:30 How much more, 637 if haply 3863 the people 5971 had eaten 398-1 freely 398-2 to day 3117 of the spoil 7998 of their enemies 341-6 which they found? 4672-1 for had there not been now a much greater 7235-1 slaughter 4347 among the Philistines? 6430

14:31 And they smote 5221-55 the Philistines 6430 that day 3117 from Michmash 4363 to Aijalon: 357 and the people 5971 were very 3966 faint. 5774-4

14:32 And the people 5971 flew 5860-4|6213-4-k upon the spoil, 7998 and took 3947-4 sheep, 6629 and oxen, 1241 and calves, 1121 1241 and slew 7819-4 [them] on the ground: 776 and the people 5971 did eat 398-4 [them] with the blood. 1818

14:33 Then they told 5046-55 Saul, 7586 saying, 559-2 Behold, the people 5971 sin 2398-6 against the LORD, 3068 in that they eat 398-2 with the blood. 1818 And he said, 559-4 Ye have transgressed: 898-1 roll 1556-3 a great 1419 stone 68 unto me this day. 3117

14:34 And Saul 7586 said, 559-4 Disperse 6327-3 yourselves among the people, 5971 and say 559-1 unto them, Bring me hither 5066-54 every man 376 his ox, 7794 and every man 376 his sheep, 7716 and slay 7819-1 [them] here, and eat; 398-1 and sin 2398-4 not against the LORD 3068 in eating 398-2 with the blood. 1818 And all the people 5971 brought 5066-55 every man 376 his ox 7794 with him 3027 that night, 3915 and slew 7819-4 [them] there.

14:35 And Saul 7586 built 1129-4 an altar 4196 unto the LORD: 3068 the same was the first 2490-52 altar 4196 that he built 1129-2 unto the LORD. 3068

14:36 And Saul 7586 said, 559-4 Let us go down 3381-4 after 310 the Philistines 6430 by night, 3915 and spoil 962-4 them until the morning 1242 light, 216 and let us not leave 7604-55 a man 376 of them. And they said, 559-4 Do 6213-3 whatsoever seemeth 5869 good 2896 unto thee. Then said 559-4 the priest, 3548 Let us draw near 7126-4 hither 1988 unto God. 430

14:37 And Saul 7586 asked 7592-4 counsel of God, 430 Shall I go down 3381-4 after 310 the Philistines? 6430 wilt thou deliver 5414-4 them into the hand 3027 of Israel? 3478 But he answered 6030-1 him not that day. 3117

14:38 And Saul 7586 said, 559-4 Draw ye near 5066-3 hither, 1988 all the chief 6438 of the people: 5971 and know 3045-3 and see 7200-3 wherein 4100 this sin 2403 hath been this day. 3117

14:39 For, [as] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 which saveth 3467-56 Israel, 3478 though it be 3426 in Jonathan 3129 my son, 1121 he shall surely 4191-2 die. 4191-4 But [there was] not a man among all the people 5971 [that] answered 6030-6 him.

14:40 Then said 559-4 he unto all Israel, 3478 Be ye on one 259 side, 5676 and I and Jonathan 3129 my son 1121 will be on the other 259 side. 5676 And the people 5971 said 559-4 unto Saul, 7586 Do 6213-3 what seemeth 5869 good 2896 unto thee.

14:41 Therefore Saul 7586 said 559-4 unto the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 Give 3051-3 a perfect 8549 [lot]. And Saul 7586 and Jonathan 3129 were taken: 3920-11 but the people 5971 escaped. 3318-1

14:42 And Saul 7586 said, 559-4 Cast 5307-54 [lots] between me and Jonathan 3129 my son. 1121 And Jonathan 3129 was taken. 3920-11

14:43 Then Saul 7586 said 559-4 to Jonathan, 3129 Tell 5046-54 me what thou hast done. 6213-1 And Jonathan 3129 told 5046-55 him, and said, 559-4 I did but 2938-2 taste 2938-1 a little 4592 honey 1706 with the end 7097 of the rod 4294 that [was] in mine hand, 3027 [and], lo, 2009 I must die. 4191-4

14:44 And Saul 7586 answered, 559-4 God 430 do 6213-4 so and more 3254-55 also: for thou shalt surely 4191-2 die, 4191-4 Jonathan. 3129

14:45 And the people 5971 said 559-4 unto Saul, 7586 Shall Jonathan 3129 die, 4191-4 who hath wrought 6213-1 this great 1419 salvation 3444 in Israel? 3478 God forbid: 2486 [as] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 there shall not one hair 8185 of his head 7218 fall 5307-4 to the ground; 776 for he hath wrought 6213-1 with God 430 this day. 3117 So the people 5971 rescued 6299-4 Jonathan, 3129 that he died 4191-1 not.

14:46 Then Saul 7586 went up 5927-4 from following 310 the Philistines: 6430 and the Philistines 6430 went 1980-1 to their own place. 4725

14:47 So Saul 7586 took 3920-1 the kingdom 4410 over Israel, 3478 and fought 3898-11 against all his enemies 341-6 on every side, 5439 against Moab, 4124 and against the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 and against Edom, 123 and against the kings 4428 of Zobah, 6678 and against the Philistines: 6430 and whithersoever he turned 6437-4 himself, he vexed 7561-55 [them].

14:48 And he gathered 6213-4 an host, 2428 and smote 5221-55 the Amalekites, 6002 and delivered 5337-55 Israel 3478 out of the hands 3027 of them that spoiled 8154-6 them.

14:49 Now the sons 1121 of Saul 7586 were Jonathan, 3129 and Ishui, 3440 and Melchishua: 4444 and the names 8034 of his two 8147 daughters 1323 [were these]; the name 8034 of the firstborn 1067 Merab, 4764 and the name 8034 of the younger 6996 Michal: 4324

14:50 And the name 8034 of Saul's 7586 wife 802 [was] Ahinoam, 293 the daughter 1323 of Ahimaaz: 290 and the name 8034 of the captain 8269 of his host 6635 [was] Abner, 74 the son 1121 of Ner, 5369 Saul's 7586 uncle. 1730

14:51 And Kish 7027 [was] the father 1 of Saul; 7586 and Ner 5369 the father 1 of Abner 74 [was] the son 1121 of Abiel. 22

14:52 And there was sore 2389 war 4421 against the Philistines 6430 all the days 3117 of Saul: 7586 and when Saul 7586 saw 7200-1 any strong 1368 man, 376 or any valiant 2428 man, 1121 he took 622-4 him unto him.

15:1 Samuel 8050 also said 559-4 unto Saul, 7586 The LORD 3068 sent 7971-1 me to anoint 4886-2 thee [to be] king 4428 over his people, 5971 over Israel: 3478 now therefore hearken 8085-3 thou unto the voice 6963 of the words 1697 of the LORD. 3068

15:2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 I remember 6485-1 [that] which Amalek 6002 did 6213-1 to Israel, 3478 how he laid 7760-1 [wait] for him in the way, 1870 when he came up 5927-2 from Egypt. 4714

15:3 Now go 3212-3 and smite 5221-52 Amalek, 6002 and utterly destroy 2763-52 all that they have, and spare 2550-4 them not; but slay 4191-52 both man 376 and woman, 802 infant 5768 and suckling, 3243-6 ox 7794 and sheep, 7716 camel 1581 and ass. 2543

15:4 And Saul 7586 gathered the people 5971 together, 8085-17 and numbered 6485-4 them in Telaim, 2923 two hundred 3967 thousand 505 footmen, 7273 and ten 6235 thousand 505 men 376 of Judah. 3063

15:5 And Saul 7586 came 935-4 to a city 5892 of Amalek, 6002 and laid wait 7378-4 693-55 in the valley. 5158

15:6 And Saul 7586 said 559-4 unto the Kenites, 7017 Go, 3212-3 depart, 5493-3 get you down 3381-3 from among 8432 the Amalekites, 6002 lest I destroy 622-4 you with them: for ye shewed 6213-1 kindness 2617 to all the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 when they came up 5927-2 out of Egypt. 4714 So the Kenites 7017 departed 5493-4 from among 8432 the Amalekites. 6003

15:7 And Saul 7586 smote 5221-55 the Amalekites 6002 from Havilah 2341 [until] thou comest 935-2 to Shur, 7793 that [is] over against 6440 Egypt. 4714

15:8 And he took 8610-4 Agag 90 the king 4428 of the Amalekites 6002 alive, 2416 and utterly destroyed 2763-52 all the people 5971 with the edge 6310 of the sword. 2719

15:9 But Saul 7586 and the people 5971 spared 2550-4 Agag, 90 and the best 4315 of the sheep, 6629 and of the oxen, 1241 and of the fatlings, 4932 and the lambs, 3733 and all [that was] good, 2896 and would 14-1 not utterly destroy 2763-53 them: but every thing 4399 [that was] vile 5240 and refuse, 4549-8 that they destroyed utterly. 2763-52

15:10 Then came the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 unto Samuel, 8050 saying, 559-2

15:11 It repenteth 5162-8 me that I have set up 4427-52 Saul 7586 [to be] king: 4428 for he is turned back 7725-1 from following 310 me, and hath not performed 6965-52 my commandments. 1697 And it grieved 2734-4 Samuel; 8050 and he cried 2199-4 unto the LORD 3068 all night. 3915

15:12 And when Samuel 8050 rose early 7925-55 to meet 7125-2 Saul 7586 in the morning, 1242 it was told 5046-93 Samuel, 8050 saying, 559-2 Saul 7586 came 935-1 to Carmel, 3760 and, behold, he set him up 5324-56 a place, 3027 and is gone about, 5437-11 and passed on, 5674-4 and gone down 3381-4 to Gilgal. 1537

15:13 And Samuel 8050 came 935-4 to Saul: 7586 and Saul 7586 said 559-4 unto him, Blessed 1288-7 [be] thou of the LORD: 3068 I have performed 6965-52 the commandment 1697 of the LORD. 3068

15:14 And Samuel 8050 said, 559-4 What [meaneth] then this bleating 6963 of the sheep 6629 in mine ears, 241 and the lowing 6963 of the oxen 1241 which I hear? 8085-6

15:15 And Saul 7586 said, 559-4 They have brought 935-52 them from the Amalekites: 6003 for the people 5971 spared 2550-1 the best 4315 of the sheep 6629 and of the oxen, 1241 to sacrifice 2076-2 unto the LORD 3068 thy God; 430 and the rest 3498-6 we have utterly destroyed. 2763-52

15:16 Then Samuel 8050 said 559-4 unto Saul, 7586 Stay, 7503-54 and I will tell 5046-55 thee what the LORD 3068 hath said 1696-14 to me this night. 3915 And he said 559-4 unto him, Say on. 1696-16

15:17 And Samuel 8050 said, 559-4 When thou [wast] little 6996 in thine own sight, 5869 [wast] thou not [made] the head 7218 of the tribes 7626 of Israel, 3478 and the LORD 3068 anointed 4886-4 thee king 4428 over Israel? 3478

15:18 And the LORD 3068 sent 7971-4 thee on a journey, 1870 and said, 559-4 Go 3212-3 and utterly destroy 2763-52 the sinners 2400 the Amalekites, 6002 and fight 3898-8 against them until they be consumed. 3615-15

15:19 Wherefore then didst thou not obey 8085-1 the voice 6963 of the LORD, 3068 but didst fly 5860-4 upon the spoil, 7998 and didst 6213-4 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD? 3068

15:20 And Saul 7586 said 559-4 unto Samuel, 8050 Yea, I have obeyed 8085-1 the voice 6963 of the LORD, 3068 and have gone 3212-4 the way 1870 which the LORD 3068 sent 7971-1 me, and have brought 935-55 Agag 90 the king 4428 of Amalek, 6002 and have utterly destroyed 2763-52 the Amalekites. 6002

15:21 But the people 5971 took 3947-4 of the spoil, 7998 sheep 6629 and oxen, 1241 the chief 7225 of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, 2764 to sacrifice 2076-2 unto the LORD 3068 thy God 430 in Gilgal. 1537

15:22 And Samuel 8050 said, 559-4 Hath the LORD 3068 [as great] delight 2656 in burnt offerings 5930 and sacrifices, 2077 as in obeying 8085-2 the voice 6963 of the LORD? 3068 Behold, to obey 8085-2 [is] better 2896 than sacrifice, 2077 [and] to hearken 7181-53 than the fat 2459 of rams. 352

15:23 For rebellion 4805 [is as] the sin 2403 of witchcraft, 7081 and stubbornness 6484-53 [is as] iniquity 205 and idolatry. 8655 Because thou hast rejected 3988-1 the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 he hath also rejected 3988-4 thee from [being] king. 4428

15:24 And Saul 7586 said 559-4 unto Samuel, 8050 I have sinned: 2398-1 for I have transgressed 5674-1 the commandment 6310 of the LORD, 3068 and thy words: 1697 because I feared 3372-1 the people, 5971 and obeyed 8085-4 their voice. 6963

15:25 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon 5375-3 my sin, 2403 and turn again 7725-3 with me, that I may worship 7812-101 the LORD. 3068

15:26 And Samuel 8050 said 559-4 unto Saul, 7586 I will not return 7725-4 with thee: for thou hast rejected 3988-1 the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 and the LORD 3068 hath rejected 3988-4 thee from being king 4428 over Israel. 3478

15:27 And as Samuel 8050 turned about 5437-11 to go away, 3212-2 he laid hold 2388-55 upon the skirt 3671 of his mantle, 4598 and it rent. 7167-11

15:28 And Samuel 8050 said 559-4 unto him, The LORD 3068 hath rent 7167-1 the kingdom 4468 of Israel 3478 from thee this day, 3117 and hath given 5414-1 it to a neighbour 7453 of thine, [that is] better 2896 than thou.

15:29 And also the Strength 5331 of Israel 3478 will not lie 8266-17 nor repent: 5162-11 for he [is] not a man, 120 that he should repent. 5162-9

15:30 Then he said, 559-4 I have sinned: 2398-1 [yet] honour 3513-16 me now, I pray thee, before the elders 2205 of my people, 5971 and before Israel, 3478 and turn again 7725-3 with me, that I may worship 7812-98 the LORD 3068 thy God. 430

15:31 So Samuel 8050 turned again 7725-4 after 310 Saul; 7586 and Saul 7586 worshipped 7812-101 the LORD. 3068

15:32 Then said 559-4 Samuel, 8050 Bring ye hither 5066-54 to me Agag 90 the king 4428 of the Amalekites. 6002 And Agag 90 came 3212-4 unto him delicately. 4574 And Agag 90 said, 559-4 Surely 403 the bitterness 4751 of death 4194 is past. 5493-1

15:33 And Samuel 8050 said, 559-4 As thy sword 2719 hath made women 802 childless, 7921-14 so shall thy mother 517 be childless 7921-4 among women. 802 And Samuel 8050 hewed Agag 90 in pieces 8158-17 before 6440 the LORD 3068 in Gilgal. 1537

15:34 Then Samuel 8050 went 3212-4 to Ramah; 7414 and Saul 7586 went up 5927-1 to his house 1004 to Gibeah 1390 of Saul. 7586

15:35 And Samuel 8050 came no more 3254-1 to see 7200-2 Saul 7586 until the day 3117 of his death: 4194 nevertheless 3588 Samuel 8050 mourned 56-98 for Saul: 7586 and the LORD 3068 repented 5162-8 that he had made Saul 7586 king 4427-52 over Israel. 3478

16:1 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Samuel, 8050 How long wilt thou mourn 56-102 for Saul, 7586 seeing I have rejected 3988-1 him from reigning 4427-2 over Israel? 3478 fill 4390-16 thine horn 7161 with oil, 8081 and go, 3212-3 I will send 7971-4 thee to Jesse 3448 the Bethlehemite: 1022 for I have provided 7200-1 me a king 4428 among his sons. 1121

16:2 And Samuel 8050 said, 559-4 How can I go? 3212-4 if Saul 7586 hear 8085-1 [it], he will kill 2026-1 me. And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 Take 3947-4 an heifer 1241 5697 with thee, 3027 and say, 559-1 I am come 935-1 to sacrifice 2076-2 to the LORD. 3068

16:3 And call 7121-1 Jesse 3448 to the sacrifice, 2077 and I will shew 3045-55 thee what thou shalt do: 6213-4 and thou shalt anoint 4886-1 unto me [him] whom I name 559-4 unto thee.

16:4 And Samuel 8050 did 6213-4 that which the LORD 3068 spake, 1696-14 and came 935-4 to Bethlehem. 1035 And the elders 2205 of the town 5892 trembled 2729-4 at his coming, 7125-2 and said, 559-4 Comest 935-2 thou peaceably? 7965

16:5 And he said, 559-4 Peaceably: 7965 I am come 935-1 to sacrifice 2076-2 unto the LORD: 3068 sanctify 6942-100 yourselves, and come 935-1 with me to the sacrifice. 2077 And he sanctified 6942-17 Jesse 3448 and his sons, 1121 and called 7121-4 them to the sacrifice. 2077

16:6 And it came to pass, when they were come, 935-2 that he looked 7200-4 on Eliab, 446 and said, 559-4 Surely the LORD'S 3068 anointed 4899 [is] before him.

16:7 But the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Samuel, 8050 Look 5027-55 not on his countenance, 4758 or on the height 1364 of his stature; 6967 because I have refused 3988-1 him: for [the LORD seeth] not as man 120 seeth; 7200-4 for man 120 looketh 7200-4 on the outward appearance, 5869 but the LORD 3068 looketh 7200-4 on the heart. 3824

16:8 Then Jesse 3448 called 7121-4 Abinadab, 41 and made him pass 5674-55 before 6440 Samuel. 8050 And he said, 559-4 Neither hath the LORD 3068 chosen 977-1 this.

16:9 Then Jesse 3448 made Shammah 8048 to pass by. 5674-55 And he said, 559-4 Neither hath the LORD 3068 chosen 977-1 this.

16:10 Again, Jesse 3448 made seven 7651 of his sons 1121 to pass 5674-55 before 6440 Samuel. 8050 And Samuel 8050 said 559-4 unto Jesse, 3448 The LORD 3068 hath not chosen 977-1 these.

16:11 And Samuel 8050 said 559-4 unto Jesse, 3448 Are here all 8552-1 [thy] children? 5288 And he said, 559-4 There remaineth 7604-1 yet the youngest, 6996 and, behold, he keepeth 7462-6 the sheep. 6629 And Samuel 8050 said 559-4 unto Jesse, 3448 Send 7971-3 and fetch 3947-3 him: for we will not sit down 5437-4 till he come 935-2 hither. 6311

16:12 And he sent, 7971-4 and brought him in. 935-55 Now he [was] ruddy, 132 [and] withal 5973 of a beautiful 3303 countenance, 5869 and goodly 2896 to look to. 7210 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 Arise, 6965-3 anoint 4886-3 him: for this [is] he.

16:13 Then Samuel 8050 took 3947-4 the horn 7161 of oil, 8081 and anointed 4886-4 him in the midst 7130 of his brethren: 251 and the Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 came 6743-4 upon David 1732 from that day 3117 forward. 4605 So Samuel 8050 rose up, 6965-4 and went 3212-4 to Ramah. 7414

16:14 But the Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 departed 5493-1 from Saul, 7586 and an evil 7451 spirit 7307 from the LORD 3068 troubled 1204-14 him.

16:15 And Saul's 7586 servants 5650 said 559-4 unto him, Behold now, an evil 7451 spirit 7307 from God 430 troubleth 1204-18 thee.

16:16 Let our lord 113 now command 559-4 thy servants, 5650 [which are] before 6440 thee, to seek out 1245-17 a man, 376 [who is] a cunning 3045-6 player 5059-18 on an harp: 3658 and it shall come to pass, when the evil 7451 spirit 7307 from God 430 is upon thee, that he shall play 5059-14 with his hand, 3027 and thou shalt be well. 2895-1

16:17 And Saul 7586 said 559-4 unto his servants, 5650 Provide 7200-3 me now a man 376 that can play 5059-15 well, 3190-56 and bring 935-52 [him] to me.

16:18 Then answered 6030-4 one 259 of the servants, 5288 and said, 559-4 Behold, I have seen 7200-1 a son 1121 of Jesse 3448 the Bethlehemite, 1022 [that is] cunning 3045-6 in playing, 5059-15 and a mighty 1368 valiant 2428 man, and a man 376 of war, 4421 and prudent 995-12 in matters, 1697 and a comely 8389 person, 376 and the LORD 3068 [is] with him.

16:19 Wherefore Saul 7586 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 unto Jesse, 3448 and said, 559-4 Send 7971-3 me David 1732 thy son, 1121 which [is] with the sheep. 6629

16:20 And Jesse 3448 took 3947-4 an ass 2543 [laden] with bread, 3899 and a bottle 4997 of wine, 3196 and a 259 kid, 1423 5795 and sent 7971-4 [them] by 3027 David 1732 his son 1121 unto Saul. 7586

16:21 And David 1732 came 935-4 to Saul, 7586 and stood 5975-4 before 6440 him: and he loved 157-4 him greatly; 3966 and he became his armourbearer. 5375-6 3627

16:22 And Saul 7586 sent 7971-4 to Jesse, 3448 saying, 559-2 Let David, 1732 I pray thee, stand 5975-4 before 6440 me; for he hath found 4672-1 favour 2580 in my sight. 5869

16:23 And it came to pass, when the [evil] spirit 7307 from God 430 was upon Saul, 7586 that David 1732 took 3947-1 an harp, 3658 and played 5059-14 with his hand: 3027 so Saul 7586 was refreshed, 7304-1 and was well, 2895-1 and the evil 7451 spirit 7307 departed 5493-1 from him.

17:1 Now the Philistines 6430 gathered 622-4 together their armies 4264 to battle, 4421 and were gathered 622-11 together at Shochoh, 7755 which [belongeth] to Judah, 3063 and pitched 2583-4 between Shochoh 7755 and Azekah, 5825 in Ephesdammim. 658

17:2 And Saul 7586 and the men 376 of Israel 3478 were gathered 622-8 together, and pitched 2583-4 by the valley 6010 of Elah, 425 and set the battle 4421 in array 6186-4 against 7125-2 the Philistines. 6430

17:3 And the Philistines 6430 stood 5975-6 on a mountain 2022 on the one side, and Israel 3478 stood 5975-6 on a mountain 2022 on the other side: and [there was] a valley 1516 between them.

17:4 And there went out 3318-4 a champion 376 1143 out of the camp 4264 of the Philistines, 6430 named 8034 Goliath, 1555 of Gath, 1661 whose height 1363 [was] six 8337 cubits 520 and a span. 2239

17:5 And [he had] an helmet 3553 of brass 5178 upon his head, 7218 and he [was] armed 3847-7 with a coat 8302 of mail; 7193 and the weight 4948 of the coat 8302 [was] five 2568 thousand 505 shekels 8255 of brass. 5178

17:6 And [he had] greaves 4697 of brass 5178 upon his legs, 7272 and a target 3591 of brass 5178 between his shoulders. 3802

17:7 And the staff 6086|2671-k of his spear 2595 [was] like a weaver's 707-6 beam; 4500 and his spear's 2595 head 3852 [weighed] six 8337 hundred 3967 shekels 8255 of iron: 1270 and one bearing 5375-6 a shield 6793 went 1980-6 before 6440 him.

17:8 And he stood 5975-4 and cried 7121-4 unto the armies 4634 of Israel, 3478 and said 559-4 unto them, Why are ye come out 3318-4 to set [your] battle 4421 in array? 6186-2 [am] not I a Philistine, 6430 and ye servants 5650 to Saul? 7586 choose 1262-3 you a man 376 for you, and let him come down 3381-4 to me.

17:9 If he be able 3201-4 to fight 3898-9 with me, and to kill 5221-52 me, then will we be your servants: 5650 but if I prevail 3201-4 against him, and kill 5221-52 him, then shall ye be our servants, 5650 and serve 5647-1 us.

17:10 And the Philistine 6430 said, 559-4 I defy 2778-14 the armies 4634 of Israel 3478 this day; 3117 give 5414-3 me a man, 376 that we may fight 3898-11 together. 3162

17:11 When Saul 7586 and all Israel 3478 heard 8085-4 those words 1697 of the Philistine, 6430 they were dismayed, 2865-11 and greatly 3966 afraid. 3372-4

17:12 Now David 1732 [was] the son 1121 of that Ephrathite 376 673 of Bethlehemjudah, 1035 3063 whose name 8034 [was] Jesse; 3448 and he had eight 8083 sons: 1121 and the man 376 went 935-1 among men 582 [for] an old man 2204-1 in the days 3117 of Saul. 7586

17:13 And the three 7969 eldest 1419 sons 1121 of Jesse 3448 went 3212-4 [and] followed 1980-1 310 Saul 7586 to the battle: 4421 and the names 8034 of his three 7969 sons 1121 that went 1980-1 to the battle 4421 [were] Eliab 446 the firstborn, 1060 and next 4932 unto him Abinadab, 41 and the third 7992 Shammah. 8048

17:14 And David 1732 [was] the youngest: 6996 and the three 7969 eldest 1419 followed 1980-1 310 Saul. 7586

17:15 But David 1732 went 1980-6 and returned 7725-6 from Saul 7586 to feed 7462-2 his father's 1 sheep 6629 at Bethlehem. 1035

17:16 And the Philistine 6430 drew near 5066-4 morning 7925-53 and evening, 6150-53 and presented 3320-101 himself forty 705 days. 3117

17:17 And Jesse 3448 said 559-4 unto David 1732 his son, 1121 Take 3947-3 now for thy brethren 251 an ephah 374 of this parched 7039 [corn], and these 2088 ten 6235 loaves, 3899 and run 7323-54 to the camp 4264 to thy brethren; 251

17:18 And carry 935-55 these ten 6235 cheeses 2461 2757 unto the captain 8269 of [their] thousand, 505 and look 6485-4 how thy brethren 251 fare, 7965 and take 3947-4 their pledge. 6161

17:19 Now Saul, 7586 and they, and all the men 376 of Israel, 3478 [were] in the valley 6010 of Elah, 425 fighting 3898-12 with the Philistines. 6430

17:20 And David 1732 rose up early 7925-55 in the morning, 1242 and left 5203-4 the sheep 6629 with a keeper, 8104-6 and took, 5375-4 and went, 3212-4 as Jesse 3448 had commanded 6680-14 him; and he came 935-4 to the trench, 4570 as the host 2428 was going forth 3318-6 to the fight, 4634 and shouted 7321-52 for the battle. 4421

17:21 For Israel 3478 and the Philistines 6430 had put the battle in array, 6186-4 army 4634 against 7125-2 army. 4634

17:22 And David 1732 left 5203-4 his carriage 3627 in the hand 3027 of the keeper 8104-6 of the carriage, 3627 and ran 7323-4 into the army, 4634 and came 935-4 and saluted 7592-4 7965 his brethren. 251

17:23 And as he talked 1696-18 with them, behold, there came up 5927-6 the champion, 376 1143 the Philistine 6430 of Gath, 1661 Goliath 1555 by name, 8034 out of the armies 4634|4630-k of the Philistines, 6430 and spake 1696-17 according to the same 428 words: 1697 and David 1732 heard 8085-4 [them].

17:24 And all the men 376 of Israel, 3478 when they saw 7200-2 the man, 376 fled 5127-4 from him, 6440 and were sore 3966 afraid. 3372-4

17:25 And the men 376 of Israel 3478 said, 559-4 Have ye seen 7200-1 this man 376 that is come up? 5927-6 surely to defy 2778-15 Israel 3478 is he come up: 5927-6 and it shall be, [that] the man 376 who killeth 5221-55 him, the king 4428 will enrich 6238-55 him with great 1419 riches, 6239 and will give 5414-4 him his daughter, 1323 and make 6213-4 his father's 1 house 1004 free 2670 in Israel. 3478

17:26 And David 1732 spake 559-4 to the men 582 that stood 5975-6 by him, saying, 559-2 What shall be done 6213-11 to the man 376 that killeth 5221-55 this 1975 Philistine, 6430 and taketh away 5493-52 the reproach 2781 from Israel? 3478 for who [is] this uncircumcised 6189 Philistine, 6430 that he should defy 2778-14 the armies 4634 of the living 2416 God? 430

17:27 And the people 5971 answered 559-4 him after this manner, 1697 saying, 559-2 So shall it be done 6213-11 to the man 376 that killeth 5221-55 him.

17:28 And Eliab 446 his eldest 1419 brother 251 heard 8085-4 when he spake 1696-15 unto the men; 582 and Eliab's 446 anger 639 was kindled 2734-4 against David, 1732 and he said, 559-4 Why camest thou down 3381-1 hither? and with whom hast thou left 5203-1 those 2007 few 4592 sheep 6629 in the wilderness? 4057 I know 3045-1 thy pride, 2087 and the naughtiness 7455 of thine heart; 3824 for thou art come down 3381-1 that thou mightest see 7200-2 the battle. 4421

17:29 And David 1732 said, 559-4 What have I now done? 6213-1 [Is there] not a cause? 1697

17:30 And he turned 5437-11 from him 681 toward 4136 another, 312 and spake 559-4 after the same manner: 1697 and the people 5971 answered 1697 him again 7725-55 after the former 7223 manner. 1697

17:31 And when the words 1697 were heard 8085-11 which David 1732 spake, 1696-14 they rehearsed 5046-55 [them] before 6440 Saul: 7586 and he sent 3947-4 for him.

17:32 And David 1732 said 559-4 to Saul, 7586 Let no man's 120 heart 3820 fail 5307-4 because of him; thy servant 5650 will go 3212-4 and fight 3898-8 with this Philistine. 6430

17:33 And Saul 7586 said 559-4 to David, 1732 Thou art not able 3201-4 to go 3212-2 against this Philistine 6430 to fight 3898-9 with him: for thou [art but] a youth, 5288 and he a man 376 of war 4421 from his youth. 5271

17:34 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto Saul, 7586 Thy servant 5650 kept 7462-6 his father's 1 sheep, 6629 and there came 935-1 a lion, 738 and a bear, 1677 and took 5375-1 a lamb 7716|2089 out of the flock: 5739

17:35 And I went out 3318-1 after 310 him, and smote 5221-52 him, and delivered 5337-52 [it] out of his mouth: 6310 and when he arose 6965-4 against me, I caught 2388-52 [him] by his beard, 2206 and smote 5221-52 him, and slew 4191-52 him.

17:36 Thy servant 5650 slew 5221-52 both the lion 738 and the bear: 1677 and this uncircumcised 6189 Philistine 6430 shall be as one 259 of them, seeing he hath defied 2778-14 the armies 4634 of the living 2416 God. 430

17:37 David 1732 said 559-4 moreover, The LORD 3068 that delivered 5337-52 me out of the paw 3027 of the lion, 738 and out of the paw 3027 of the bear, 1677 he will deliver 5337-55 me out of the hand 3027 of this Philistine. 6430 And Saul 7586 said 559-4 unto David, 1732 Go, 3212-3 and the LORD 3068 be with thee.

17:38 And Saul 7586 armed 3847-55 David 1732 with his armour, 4055 and he put 5414-1 an helmet 6959 of brass 5178 upon his head; 7218 also he armed 3847-55 him with a coat of mail. 8302

17:39 And David 1732 girded 2296-4 his sword 2719 upon his armour, 4055 and he assayed 2974-55 to go; 3212-2 for he had not proved 5254-14 [it]. And David 1732 said 559-4 unto Saul, 7586 I cannot 3808 3201-4 go 3212-2 with these; for I have not proved 5254-14 [them]. And David 1732 put 5493-55 them off him.

17:40 And he took 3947-4 his staff 4731 in his hand, 3027 and chose 977-4 him five 2568 smooth 2512 stones 68 out of the brook, 5158 and put 7760-4 them in a shepherd's 7462-6 bag 3627 which he had, even in a scrip; 3219 and his sling 7050 [was] in his hand: 3027 and he drew near 5066-4 to the Philistine. 6430

17:41 And the Philistine 6430 came 3212-4 on 1980-6 and drew near 7131 unto David; 1732 and the man 376 that bare 5375-6 the shield 6793 [went] before 6440 him.

17:42 And when the Philistine 6430 looked about, 5027-55 and saw 7200-4 David, 1732 he disdained 959-4 him: for he was [but] a youth, 5288 and ruddy, 132 and of a fair 3303 countenance. 4758

17:43 And the Philistine 6430 said 559-4 unto David, 1732 [Am] I a dog, 3611 that thou comest 935-6 to me with staves? 4731 And the Philistine 6430 cursed 7043-17 David 1732 by his gods. 430

17:44 And the Philistine 6430 said 559-4 to David, 1732 Come 3212-3 to me, and I will give 5414-4 thy flesh 1320 unto the fowls 5775 of the air, 8064 and to the beasts 929 of the field. 7704

17:45 Then said 559-4 David 1732 to the Philistine, 6430 Thou comest 935-6 to me with a sword, 2719 and with a spear, 2595 and with a shield: 3591 but I come 935-6 to thee in the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of the armies 4634 of Israel, 3478 whom thou hast defied. 2778-14

17:46 This day 3117 will the LORD 3068 deliver 5462-17 thee into mine hand; 3027 and I will smite 5221-52 thee, and take 5493-52 thine head 7218 from thee; and I will give 5414-1 the carcases 6297 of the host 4264 of the Philistines 6430 this day 3117 unto the fowls 5775 of the air, 8064 and to the wild beasts 2416 of the earth; 776 that all the earth 776 may know 3045-4 that there is 3426 a God 430 in Israel. 3478

17:47 And all this assembly 6951 shall know 3045-4 that the LORD 3068 saveth 3467-55 not with sword 2719 and spear: 2595 for the battle 4421 [is] the LORD'S, 3068 and he will give 5414-1 you into our hands. 3027

17:48 And it came to pass, when the Philistine 6430 arose, 6965-1 and came 3212-4 and drew nigh 7126-4 to meet 7125-2 David, 1732 that David 1732 hasted, 4116-17 and ran 7323-4 toward the army 4634 to meet 7125-2 the Philistine. 6430

17:49 And David 1732 put 7971-4 his hand 3027 in his bag, 3627 and took 3947-4 thence a stone, 68 and slang 7049-17 [it], and smote 5221-55 the Philistine 6430 in his forehead, 4696 that the stone 68 sunk 2883-4 into his forehead; 4696 and he fell 5307-4 upon his face 6440 to the earth. 776

17:50 So David 1732 prevailed 2388-4 over 4480 the Philistine 6430 with a sling 7050 and with a stone, 68 and smote 5221-55 the Philistine, 6430 and slew 4191-55 him; but [there was] no sword 2719 in the hand 3027 of David. 1732

17:51 Therefore David 1732 ran, 7323-4 and stood 5975-4 upon the Philistine, 6430 and took 3947-4 his sword, 2719 and drew 8025-4 it out of the sheath 8593 thereof, and slew 4191-34 him, and cut off 3772-4 his head 7218 therewith. And when the Philistines 6430 saw 7200-4 their champion 1368 was dead, 4191-1 they fled. 5127-4

17:52 And the men 582 of Israel 3478 and of Judah 3063 arose, 6965-4 and shouted, 7321-55 and pursued 7291-4 the Philistines, 6430 until thou come 935-2 to the valley, 1516 and to the gates 8179 of Ekron. 6138 And the wounded 2491 of the Philistines 6430 fell down 5307-4 by the way 1870 to Shaaraim, 8189 even unto Gath, 1661 and unto Ekron. 6138

17:53 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 returned 7725-4 from chasing 1814-2 after 310 the Philistines, 6430 and they spoiled 8155-4 their tents. 4264

17:54 And David 1732 took 3947-4 the head 7218 of the Philistine, 6430 and brought 935-55 it to Jerusalem; 3389 but he put 7760-1 his armour 3627 in his tent. 168

17:55 And when Saul 7586 saw 7200-2 David 1732 go forth 3318-6 against 7125-2 the Philistine, 6430 he said 559-1 unto Abner, 74 the captain 8269 of the host, 6635 Abner, 74 whose son 1121 [is] this youth? 5288 And Abner 74 said, 559-4 [As] thy soul 5315 liveth, 2416 O king, 4428 I cannot 518 tell. 3045-1

17:56 And the king 4428 said, 559-4 Enquire 7592-3 thou whose son 1121 the stripling 5958 [is].

17:57 And as David 1732 returned 7725-2 from the slaughter 5221-53 of the Philistine, 6430 Abner 74 took 3947-4 him, and brought 935-55 him before 6440 Saul 7586 with the head 7218 of the Philistine 6430 in his hand. 3027

17:58 And Saul 7586 said 559-4 to him, Whose son 1121 [art] thou, [thou] young man? 5288 And David 1732 answered, 559-4 I [am] the son 1121 of thy servant 5650 Jesse 3448 the Bethlehemite. 1022

18:1 And it came to pass, when he had made an end 3615-15 of speaking 1696-15 unto Saul, 7586 that the soul 5315 of Jonathan 3083 was knit 7194-8 with the soul 5315 of David, 1732 and Jonathan 3083 loved 157-4 him as his own soul. 5315

18:2 And Saul 7586 took 3947-4 him that day, 3117 and would let 5414-1 him go no more home 7725-2 to his father's 1 house. 1004

18:3 Then Jonathan 3083 and David 1732 made 3772-4 a covenant, 1285 because he loved 160 him as his own soul. 5315

18:4 And Jonathan 3083 stripped 6584-101 himself of the robe 4598 that [was] upon him, and gave 5414-4 it to David, 1732 and his garments, 4055 even to his sword, 2719 and to his bow, 7198 and to his girdle. 2289

18:5 And David 1732 went out 3318-4 whithersoever Saul 7586 sent 7971-4 him, [and] behaved himself wisely: 7919-55 and Saul 7586 set 7760-4 him over the men 582 of war, 4421 and he was accepted 3190-4 in the sight 5869 of all the people, 5971 and also in the sight 5869 of Saul's 7586 servants. 5650

18:6 And it came to pass as they came, 935-2 when David 1732 was returned 7725-2 from the slaughter 5221-53 of the Philistine, 6430 that the women 802 came out 3318-4 of all cities 5892 of Israel, 3478 singing 7891-2 and dancing, 4246 to meet 7125-2 king 4428 Saul, 7586 with tabrets, 8596 with joy, 8057 and with instruments 7991 of musick.

18:7 And the women 802 answered 6030-4 [one another] as they played, 7832-18 and said, 559-4 Saul 7586 hath slain 5221-52 his thousands, 505 and David 1732 his ten thousands. 7233

18:8 And Saul 7586 was very 3966 wroth, 2734-4 and the saying 1697 displeased 3415-4 5869 him; and he said, 559-4 They have ascribed 5414-1 unto David 1732 ten thousands, 7233 and to me they have ascribed 5414-1 [but] thousands: 505 and [what] can he have more but the kingdom? 4410

18:9 And Saul 7586 eyed 5770-6 David 1732 from that day 3117 and forward. 1973

18:10 And it came to pass on the morrow, 4283 that the evil 7451 spirit 7307 from God 430 came 6743-4 upon Saul, 7586 and he prophesied 5012-101 in the midst 8432 of the house: 1004 and David 1732 played 5059-18 with his hand, 3027 as at other times: 3117 3117 and [there was] a javelin 2595 in Saul's 7586 hand. 3027

18:11 And Saul 7586 cast 2904-55 the javelin; 2595 for he said, 559-4 I will smite 5221-55 David 1732 even to the wall 7023 [with it]. And David 1732 avoided 5437-11 out of his presence 6440 twice. 6471

18:12 And Saul 7586 was afraid 3372-4 of 6440 David, 1732 because the LORD 3068 was with him, and was departed 5493-1 from Saul. 7586

18:13 Therefore Saul 7586 removed 5493-55 him from him, and made 7760-4 him his captain 8269 over a thousand; 505 and he went out 3318-4 and came in 935-4 before 6440 the people. 5971

18:14 And David 1732 behaved himself wisely 7919-56 in all his ways; 1870 and the LORD 3068 [was] with him.

18:15 Wherefore when Saul 7586 saw 7200-4 that he behaved himself very 3966 wisely, 7919-56 he was afraid 1481-4 of 6440 him.

18:16 But all Israel 3478 and Judah 3063 loved 157-6 David, 1732 because he went out 3318-6 and came in 935-6 before 6440 them.

18:17 And Saul 7586 said 559-4 to David, 1732 Behold my elder 1419 daughter 1323 Merab, 4764 her will I give 5414-4 thee to wife: 802 only be thou valiant 1121 2428 for me, and fight 3898-10 the LORD'S 3068 battles. 4421 For Saul 7586 said, 559-1 Let not mine hand 3027 be upon him, but let the hand 3027 of the Philistines 6430 be upon him.

18:18 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto Saul, 7586 Who [am] I? and what [is] my life, 2416 [or] my father's 1 family 4940 in Israel, 3478 that I should be son in law 2860 to the king? 4428

18:19 But it came to pass at the time 6256 when Merab 4764 Saul's 7586 daughter 1323 should have been given 5414-2 to David, 1732 that she was given 5414-8 unto Adriel 5741 the Meholathite 4259 to wife. 802

18:20 And Michal 4324 Saul's 7586 daughter 1323 loved 157-4 David: 1732 and they told 5046-55 Saul, 7586 and the thing 1697 pleased 3474-4 5869 him.

18:21 And Saul 7586 said, 559-4 I will give 5414-4 him her, that she may be a snare 4170 to him, and that the hand 3027 of the Philistines 6430 may be against him. Wherefore Saul 7586 said 559-4 to David, 1732 Thou shalt this day 3117 be my son in law 2859-101 in [the one of] the twain. 8147

18:22 And Saul 7586 commanded 6680-17 his servants, 5650 [saying], Commune 1696-16 with David 1732 secretly, 3909 and say, 559-2 Behold, the king 4428 hath delight 2654-1 in thee, and all his servants 5650 love 157-1 thee: now therefore be the king's 4428 son in law. 2859-100

18:23 And Saul's 7586 servants 5650 spake 1696-17 those words 1697 in the ears 241 of David. 1732 And David 1732 said, 559-4 Seemeth 5869 it to you [a] light 7043-8 [thing] to be a king's 4428 son in law, 2859-99 seeing that I [am] a poor 7326-6 man, 376 and lightly esteemed? 7034-12

18:24 And the servants 5650 of Saul 7586 told 5046-55 him, saying, 559-2 On this manner 1697 spake 1696-14 David. 1732

18:25 And Saul 7586 said, 559-4 Thus shall ye say 559-4 to David, 1732 The king 4428 desireth 2656 not any dowry, 4119 but an hundred 3967 foreskins 6190 of the Philistines, 6430 to be avenged 5358-9 of the king's 4428 enemies. 341-6 But Saul 7586 thought 2803-1 to make David 1732 fall 5307-53 by the hand 3027 of the Philistines. 6430

18:26 And when his servants 5650 told 5046-55 David 1732 these words, 1697 it 1697 pleased 3474-4 5869 David 1732 well to be the king's 4428 son in law: 2859-99 and the days 3117 were not expired. 4390-1

18:27 Wherefore David 1732 arose 6965-4 and went, 3212-4 he and his men, 582 and slew 5221-55 of the Philistines 6430 two hundred 3967 men; 376 and David 1732 brought 935-55 their foreskins, 6190 and they gave them in full 4390-17 tale to the king, 4428 that he might be the king's 4428 son in law. 2859-99 And Saul 7586 gave 5414-4 him Michal 4324 his daughter 1323 to wife. 802

18:28 And Saul 7586 saw 7200-4 and knew 3045-4 that the LORD 3068 [was] with David, 1732 and [that] Michal 4324 Saul's 7586 daughter 1323 loved 157-1 him.

18:29 And Saul 7586 was yet the more 3254-55 afraid 3372-2 of 6440 David; 1732 and Saul 7586 became David's 1732 enemy 341-6 continually. 3605 3117

18:30 Then the princes 8269 of the Philistines 6430 went forth: 3318-4 and it came to pass, after 1767 they went forth, 3318-2 [that] David 1732 behaved himself more wisely 7919-1 than all the servants 5650 of Saul; 7586 so that his name 8034 was much 3966 set by. 3365-4

19:1 And Saul 7586 spake 1696-17 to Jonathan 3129 his son, 1121 and to all his servants, 5650 that they should kill 4191-53 David. 1732

19:2 But Jonathan 3083 Saul's 7586 son 1121 delighted 2654-1 much 3966 in David: 1732 and Jonathan 3083 told 5046-55 David, 1732 saying, 559-2 Saul 7586 my father 1 seeketh 1245-18 to kill 4191-53 thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed 8104-10 to thyself until the morning, 1242 and abide 3427-1 in a secret 5643 [place], and hide 2244-8 thyself:

19:3 And I will go out 3318-4 and stand 5975-1 beside 3027 my father 1 in the field 7704 where thou [art], and I will commune 1696-17 with my father 1 of thee; and what 4100 I see, 7200-1 that I will tell 5046-52 thee.

19:4 And Jonathan 3083 spake 1696-17 good 2896 of David 1732 unto Saul 7586 his father, 1 and said 559-4 unto him, Let not the king 4428 sin 2398-4 against his servant, 5650 against David; 1732 because he hath not sinned 2398-1 against thee, and because his works 4639 [have been] to thee-ward very 3966 good: 2896

19:5 For he did put 7760-4 his life 5315 in his hand, 3709 and slew 5221-55 the Philistine, 6430 and the LORD 3068 wrought 6213-4 a great 1419 salvation 8668 for all Israel: 3478 thou sawest 7200-1 [it], and didst rejoice: 8055-4 wherefore then wilt thou sin 2398-4 against innocent 5355 blood, 1818 to slay 4191-53 David 1732 without a cause? 2600

19:6 And Saul 7586 hearkened 8085-4 unto the voice 6963 of Jonathan: 3083 and Saul 7586 sware, 7650-11 [As] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 he shall not 518 be slain. 4191-93

19:7 And Jonathan 3083 called 7121-4 David, 1732 and Jonathan 3083 shewed 5046-55 him all those things. 1697 And Jonathan 3083 brought 935-55 David 1732 to Saul, 7586 and he was in his presence, 6440 as in times past. 865 8032

19:8 And there was war 4421 again: 3254-55 and David 1732 went out, 3318-4 and fought 3898-11 with the Philistines, 6430 and slew 5221-55 them with a great 1419 slaughter; 4347 and they fled 5127-4 from him. 6440

19:9 And the evil 7451 spirit 7307 from the LORD 3068 was upon Saul, 7586 as he sat 3427-6 in his house 1004 with his javelin 2595 in his hand: 3027 and David 1732 played 5059-18 with [his] hand. 3027

19:10 And Saul 7586 sought 1245-17 to smite 5221-53 David 1732 even to the wall 7023 with the javelin; 2595 but he slipped away 6362-4 out of Saul's 7586 presence, 6440 and he smote 5221-55 the javelin 2595 into the wall: 7023 and David 1732 fled, 5127-1 and escaped 4422-11 that night. 3915

19:11 Saul 7586 also sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 unto David's 1732 house, 1004 to watch 8104-2 him, and to slay 4191-53 him in the morning: 1242 and Michal 4324 David's 1732 wife 802 told 5046-55 him, saying, 559-2 If thou save 4422-18 not thy life 5315 to night, 3915 to morrow 4279 thou shalt be slain. 4191-94

19:12 So Michal 4324 let David 1732 down 3381-55 through a window: 2474 and he went, 3212-4 and fled, 1272-4 and escaped. 4422-11

19:13 And Michal 4324 took 3947-4 an image, 8655 and laid 7760-4 [it] in the bed, 4296 and put 7760-1 a pillow 3523 of goats' 5795 [hair] for his bolster, 4763 and covered 3680-17 [it] with a cloth. 899

19:14 And when Saul 7586 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 to take 3947-2 David, 1732 she said, 559-4 He [is] sick. 2470-6

19:15 And Saul 7586 sent 7971-4 the messengers 4397 [again] to see 7200-2 David, 1732 saying, 559-2 Bring him up 5927-54 to me in the bed, 4296 that I may slay 4191-53 him.

19:16 And when the messengers 4397 were come in, 935-4 behold, [there was] an image 8655 in the bed, 4296 with a pillow 3523 of goats' 5795 [hair] for his bolster. 4763

19:17 And Saul 7586 said 559-4 unto Michal, 4324 Why hast thou deceived 7411-14 me so, and sent away 7971-17 mine enemy, 341-6 that he is escaped? 4422-11 And Michal 4324 answered 559-4 Saul, 7586 He said 559-1 unto me, Let me go; 7971-16 why should I kill 4191-55 thee?

19:18 So David 1732 fled, 1272-1 and escaped, 4422-11 and came 935-4 to Samuel 8050 to Ramah, 7414 and told 5046-55 him all that Saul 7586 had done 6213-1 to him. And he and Samuel 8050 went 3212-4 and dwelt 3427-4 in Naioth. 5121

19:19 And it was told 5046-93 Saul, 7586 saying, 559-2 Behold, David 1732 [is] at Naioth 5121 in Ramah. 7414

19:20 And Saul 7586 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 to take 3947-2 David: 1732 and when they saw 7200-4 the company 3862 of the prophets 5030 prophesying, 5012-12 and Samuel 8050 standing 5975-6 [as] appointed 5324-12 over them, the Spirit 7307 of God 430 was upon the messengers 4397 of Saul, 7586 and they also prophesied. 5012-101

19:21 And when it was told 5046-55 Saul, 7586 he sent 7971-4 other 312 messengers, 4397 and they prophesied 5012-101 likewise. And Saul 7586 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 again 3254-55 the third 7992 time, and they prophesied 5012-101 also.

19:22 Then went 3212-4 he also to Ramah, 7414 and came 935-4 to a great 1419 well 953 that [is] in Sechu: 7906 and he asked 7592-4 and said, 559-4 Where 375 [are] Samuel 8050 and David? 1732 And [one] said, 559-4 Behold, [they be] at Naioth 5121 in Ramah. 7414

19:23 And he went 3212-4 thither to Naioth 5121 in Ramah: 7414 and the Spirit 7307 of God 430 was upon him also, and he went 3212-4 on, 1980-2 and prophesied, 5012-101 until he came 935-2 to Naioth 5121 in Ramah. 7414

19:24 And he stripped off 6584-4 his clothes 899 also, 1571 and prophesied 5012-101 before 6440 Samuel 8050 in like manner, 1571 and lay down 5307-4 naked 6174 all that day 3117 and all that night. 3915 Wherefore they say, 559-4 [Is] Saul 7586 also among the prophets? 5030

20:1 And David 1732 fled 1272-4 from Naioth 5121 in Ramah, 7414 and came 935-4 and said 559-4 before 6440 Jonathan, 3083 What have I done? 6213-1 what [is] mine iniquity? 5771 and what [is] my sin 2403 before 6440 thy father, 1 that he seeketh 1245-18 my life? 5315

20:2 And he said 559-4 unto him, God forbid; 2486 thou shalt not die: 4191-4 behold, my father 1 will do 6213-4|6213-1-k nothing either great 1419 1697 or small, 6996 1697 but that he will shew 1540-4 it me: 241 and why should my father 1 hide 5641-55 this thing 1697 from me? it [is] not [so].

20:3 And David 1732 sware 7650-11 moreover, and said, 559-4 Thy father 1 certainly 3045-2 knoweth 3045-1 that I have found 4672-1 grace 2580 in thine eyes; 5869 and he saith, 559-4 Let not Jonathan 3083 know 3045-4 this, lest he be grieved: 6087-11 but truly 199 [as] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 and [as] thy soul 5315 liveth, 2416 [there is] but a step 6587 between me and death. 4194

20:4 Then said 559-4 Jonathan 3083 unto David, 1732 Whatsoever thy soul 5315 desireth, 559-4 I will even do 6213-4 [it] for thee.

20:5 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto Jonathan, 3083 Behold, to morrow 4279 [is] the new moon, 2320 and I should not fail 3427-2 to sit 3427-4 with the king 4428 at meat: 398-2 but let me go, 7971-14 that I may hide 5641-8 myself in the field 7704 unto the third 7992 [day] at even. 6153

20:6 If thy father 1 at all 6485-2 miss 6485-4 me, then say, 559-1 David 1732 earnestly 7592-9 asked 7592-8 [leave] of me that he might run 7323-2 to Bethlehem 1035 his city: 5892 for [there is] a yearly 3117 sacrifice 2077 there for all the family. 4940

20:7 If he say 559-4 thus, [It is] well; 2896 thy servant 5650 shall have peace: 7965 but if he be very 2734-2 wroth, 2734-4 [then] be sure 3045-3 that evil 7451 is determined 3615-1 by him.

20:8 Therefore thou shalt deal 6213-1 kindly 2617 with thy servant; 5650 for thou hast brought 935-52 thy servant 5650 into a covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 with thee: notwithstanding, if there be 3426 in me iniquity, 5771 slay 4191-54 me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring 935-55 me to thy father? 1

20:9 And Jonathan 3083 said, 559-4 Far be it 2486 from thee: for if I knew 3045-4 certainly 3045-2 that evil 7451 were determined 3615-1 by my father 1 to come 935-2 upon thee, then would not I tell 5046-55 it thee?

20:10 Then said 559-4 David 1732 to Jonathan, 3083 Who shall tell 5046-55 me? or what [if] thy father 1 answer 6030-4 thee roughly? 7186

20:11 And Jonathan 3083 said 559-4 unto David, 1732 Come, 3212-3 and let us go out 3318-4 into the field. 7704 And they went out 3318-4 both 8147 of them into the field. 7704

20:12 And Jonathan 3083 said 559-4 unto David, 1732 O LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 when I have sounded 2713-4 my father 1 about to morrow 4279 any time, 6256 [or] the third 7992 [day], and, behold, [if there be] good 2895-1 toward David, 1732 and I then send 7971-4 not unto thee, and shew 1540-1 it thee; 241

20:13 The LORD 3068 do 6213-4 so 3541 and much 3541 more 3254-55 to Jonathan: 3083 but if it please 3190-55 my father 1 [to do] thee evil, 7451 then I will shew 1540-1 it thee, 241 and send thee away, 7971-14 that thou mayest go 1980-1 in peace: 7965 and the LORD 3068 be with thee, as he hath been with my father. 1

20:14 And thou shalt not only while yet 518 I live 2416 shew 6213-4 me the kindness 2617 of the LORD, 3068 that I die 4191-4 not:

20:15 But [also] thou shalt not cut off 3772-55 thy kindness 2617 from my house 1004 for 5704 ever: 5769 no, not when the LORD 3068 hath cut off 3772-53 the enemies 341-6 of David 1732 every one 376 from the face 6440 of the earth. 127

20:16 So Jonathan 3083 made 3772-4 [a covenant] with the house 1004 of David, 1732 [saying], Let the LORD 3068 even require 1245-14 [it] at the hand 3027 of David's 1732 enemies. 341-6

20:17 And Jonathan 3083 caused David 1732 to swear 7650-53 again, 3254-55 because he loved 160 him: for he loved 157-1 him as he loved 160 his own soul. 5315

20:18 Then Jonathan 3083 said 559-4 to David, To morrow 4279 [is] the new moon: 2320 and thou shalt be missed, 6485-8 because thy seat 4186 will be empty. 6485-11

20:19 And [when] thou hast stayed three days, 8027-14 [then] thou shalt go down 3381-4 quickly, 3966 and come 935-1 to the place 4725 where thou didst hide 5641-8 thyself when 3117 the business 4639 was [in hand], and shalt remain 3427-1 by 681 the stone 68 Ezel. 237

20:20 And I will shoot 3384-55 three 7969 arrows 2671 on the side 6654 [thereof], as though I shot 7971-15 at a mark. 4307

20:21 And, behold, I will send 7971-4 a lad, 5288 [saying], Go, 3212-3 find out 4672-3 the arrows. 2671 If I expressly 559-2 say 559-4 unto the lad, 5288 Behold, the arrows 2671 [are] on this side of thee, take 3947-3 them; then come 935-3 thou: for [there is] peace 7965 to thee, and no hurt; 1697 [as] the LORD 3068 liveth. 2416

20:22 But if I say 559-4 thus unto the young man, 5958 Behold, the arrows 2671 [are] beyond 1973 thee; go thy way: 3212-3 for the LORD 3068 hath sent thee away. 7971-14

20:23 And [as touching] the matter 1697 which thou and I have spoken 1696-14 of, behold, the LORD 3068 [be] between thee and me for 5704 ever. 5769

20:24 So David 1732 hid 5641-11 himself in the field: 7704 and when the new moon 2320 was come, the king 4428 sat him down 3427-4 to eat 398-2 meat. 3899

20:25 And the king 4428 sat 3427-4 upon his seat, 4186 as at other times, 6471 6471 [even] upon a seat 4186 by the wall: 7023 and Jonathan 3083 arose, 6965-4 and Abner 74 sat 3427-4 by Saul's 7586 side, 6654 and David's 1732 place 4725 was empty. 6485-11

20:26 Nevertheless Saul 7586 spake 1696-14 not any thing 3972 that day: 3117 for he thought, 559-1 Something hath befallen 4745 him, he [is] not 1115 clean; 2889 surely he [is] not clean. 2889

20:27 And it came to pass on the morrow, 4283 [which was] the second 8145 [day] of the month, 2320 that David's 1732 place 4725 was empty: 6485-11 and Saul 7586 said 559-4 unto Jonathan 3083 his son, 1121 Wherefore cometh 935-1 not the son 1121 of Jesse 3448 to meat, 3899 neither yesterday, 8543 nor to day? 3117

20:28 And Jonathan 3083 answered 6030-4 Saul, 7586 David 1732 earnestly 7592-9 asked 7592-8 [leave] of me 5978 [to go] to Bethlehem: 1035

20:29 And he said, 559-4 Let me go, 7971-16 I pray thee; for our family 4940 hath a sacrifice 2077 in the city; 5892 and my brother, 251 he hath commanded 6680-14 me [to be there]: and now, if I have found 4672-1 favour 2580 in thine eyes, 5869 let me get away, 4422-11 I pray thee, and see 7200-4 my brethren. 251 Therefore he cometh 935-1 not unto the king's 4428 table. 7979

20:30 Then Saul's 7586 anger 639 was kindled 2734-4 against Jonathan, 3083 and he said 559-4 unto him, Thou son 1121 of the perverse 5753-12 rebellious 4780 [woman], do not I know 3045-1 that thou hast chosen 977-6 the son 1121 of Jesse 3448 to thine own confusion, 1322 and unto the confusion 1322 of thy mother's 517 nakedness? 6172

20:31 For as long as 3117 the son 1121 of Jesse 3448 liveth 2425-1 upon the ground, 127 thou shalt not be established, 3559-11 nor thy kingdom. 4438 Wherefore now send 7971-3 and fetch 3947-3 him unto me, for he shall surely die. 1121 4194

20:32 And Jonathan 3083 answered 6030-4 Saul 7586 his father, 1 and said 559-4 unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? 4191-93 what hath he done? 6213-1

20:33 And Saul 7586 cast 2904-55 a javelin 2595 at him to smite 5221-53 him: whereby Jonathan 3083 knew 3045-4 that it was determined 3617 of his father 1 to slay 4191-53 David. 1732

20:34 So Jonathan 3083 arose 6965-4 from the table 7979 in fierce 2750 anger, 639 and did eat 398-1 no meat 3899 the second 8145 day 3117 of the month: 2320 for he was grieved 6087-8 for David, 1732 because his father 1 had done him shame. 3637-52

20:35 And it came to pass in the morning, 1242 that Jonathan 3083 went out 3318-4 into the field 7704 at the time appointed 4150 with David, 1732 and a little 6996 lad 5288 with him.

20:36 And he said 559-4 unto his lad, 5288 Run, 7323-3 find out 4672-3 now the arrows 2671 which I shoot. 3384-56 [And] as the lad 5288 ran, 7323-5 he shot 3384-1 an arrow 2678 beyond 5674-53 him.

20:37 And when the lad 5288 was come 935-4 to the place 4725 of the arrow 2678 which Jonathan 3083 had shot, 3384-1 Jonathan 3083 cried 7121-4 after 310 the lad, 5288 and said, 559-4 [Is] not the arrow 2678 beyond 1973 thee?

20:38 And Jonathan 3083 cried 7121-4 after 310 the lad, 5288 Make speed, 4120 haste, 2363-3 stay 5975-4 not. And Jonathan's 3083 lad 5288 gathered up 3950-17 the arrows, 2671|2678-k and came 935-4 to his master. 113

20:39 But the lad 5288 knew 3045-1 not any thing: 3972 only Jonathan 3083 and David 1732 knew 3045-1 the matter. 1697

20:40 And Jonathan 3083 gave 5414-4 his artillery 3627 unto his lad, 5288 and said 559-4 unto him, Go, 3212-3 carry 935-54 [them] to the city. 5892

20:41 [And] as soon as the lad 5288 was gone, 935-6 David 1732 arose 6965-1 out of [a place] toward 681 the south, 5045 and fell 5307-4 on his face 639 to the ground, 776 and bowed 7812-101 himself three 7969 times: 6471 and they kissed 5401-4 one 376 another, 7453 and wept 1058-4 one 376 with another, 7453 until David 1732 exceeded. 1431-52

20:42 And Jonathan 3083 said 559-4 to David, 1732 Go 3212-3 in peace, 7965 forasmuch as we have sworn 7650-8 both 8147 of us in the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 The LORD 3068 be between me and thee, and between my seed 2233 and thy seed 2233 for 5704 ever. 5769 And he arose 6965-4 and departed: 3212-4 and Jonathan 3083 went into 935-6 the city. 5892

21:1 Then came 935-4 David 1732 to Nob 5011 to Ahimelech 288 the priest: 3548 and Ahimelech 288 was afraid 2729-4 at the meeting 7125-2 of David, 1732 and said 559-4 unto him, Why [art] thou alone, and no man 376 with thee?

21:2 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto Ahimelech 288 the priest, 3548 The king 4428 hath commanded 6680-14 me a business, 1697 and hath said 559-4 unto me, Let no man 376 know 3045-4 any thing 3972 of the business 1697 whereabout I send 7971-6 thee, and what I have commanded 6680-14 thee: and I have appointed 3045-19 [my] servants 5288 to such 6423 and such 492 a place. 4725

21:3 Now therefore what is 3426 under thine hand? 3027 give 5414-3 [me] five 2568 [loaves of] bread 3899 in mine hand, 3027 or what there is present. 4672-12

21:4 And the priest 3548 answered 6030-4 David, 1732 and said, 559-4 [There is] no common 2455 bread 3899 under mine hand, 3027 but there is 3426 hallowed 6944 bread; 3899 if the young men 5288 have kept 8104-8 themselves at least 389 from women. 802

21:5 And David 1732 answered 6030-4 the priest, 3548 and said 559-4 unto him, Of a truth 518 women 802 [have been] kept 6113-7 from us about these three 8032 days, 8543 since I came out, 3318-2 and the vessels 3627 of the young men 5288 are holy, 6944 and [the bread is] in a manner 1870 common, 2455 yea, though it were sanctified 6942-4 this day 3117 in the vessel. 3627

21:6 So the priest 3548 gave 5414-4 him hallowed 6944 [bread]: for there was no bread 3899 there but the shewbread, 3899 6440 that was taken from 5493-94 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 to put 7760-2 hot 2527 bread 3899 in the day 3117 when it was taken away. 3947-9

21:7 Now a certain man 376 of the servants 5650 of Saul 7586 [was] there that day, 3117 detained 6113-12 before 6440 the LORD; 3068 and his name 8034 [was] Doeg, 1673 an Edomite, 130 the chiefest 47 of the herdmen 7462-6 that [belonged] to Saul. 7586

21:8 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto Ahimelech, 288 And is there 3426 not 371 here under thine hand 3027 spear 2595 or sword? 2719 for I have neither brought 3947-1 my sword 2719 nor my weapons 3627 with me, 3027 because the king's 4428 business 1697 required 1961-1 haste. 5169-7

21:9 And the priest 3548 said, 559-4 The sword 2719 of Goliath 1555 the Philistine, 6430 whom thou slewest 5221-52 in the valley 6010 of Elah, 425 behold, it [is here] wrapped 3874-7 in a cloth 8071 behind 310 the ephod: 646 if thou wilt take 3947-4 that, take 3947-3 [it]: for [there is] no other 312 save 2108 that here. 2088 And David 1732 said, 559-4 [There is] none like that; give 5414-3 it me.

21:10 And David 1732 arose, 6965-4 and fled 1272-4 that day 3117 for fear 6440 of Saul, 7586 and went 935-4 to Achish 397 the king 4428 of Gath. 1661

21:11 And the servants 5650 of Achish 397 said 559-4 unto him, [Is] not this David 1732 the king 4428 of the land? 776 did they not sing 6030-4 one to another of him 2088 in dances, 4246 saying, 559-2 Saul 7586 hath slain 5221-52 his thousands, 505 and David 1732 his ten thousands? 7233

21:12 And David 1732 laid up 7760-4 these words 1697 in his heart, 3824 and was sore 3966 afraid 3372-4 of 6440 Achish 397 the king 4428 of Gath. 1661

21:13 And he changed 8138-17 his behaviour 2940 before 5869 them, and feigned himself mad 1984-108 in their hands, 3027 and scrabbled 8427-17 on the doors 1817 of the gate, 8179 and let his spittle 7388 fall down 3381-55 upon his beard. 2206

21:14 Then said 559-4 Achish 397 unto his servants, 5650 Lo, ye see 7200-4 the man 376 is mad: 7696-102 wherefore [then] have ye brought 935-55 him to me?

21:15 Have I need 2638 of mad 7696-30 men, that ye have brought 935-52 this [fellow] to play the mad 7696-99 man in my presence? shall this [fellow] come 935-4 into my house? 1004

22:1 David 1732 therefore departed 3212-4 thence, and escaped 4422-11 to the cave 4631 Adullam: 5725 and when his brethren 251 and all his father's 1 house 1004 heard 8085-4 [it], they went down 3381-4 thither to him.

22:2 And every one 376 [that was] in distress, 4689 and every one 376 that [was] in debt, 5378-5 and every one 376 [that was] discontented, 4751 5315 gathered 6908-101 themselves unto him; and he became a captain 8269 over them: and there were with him about four 702 hundred 3967 men. 376

22:3 And David 1732 went 3212-4 thence to Mizpeh 4708 of Moab: 4124 and he said 559-4 unto the king 4428 of Moab, 4124 Let my father 1 and my mother, 517 I pray thee, come forth, 3318-4 [and be] with you, till I know 3045-4 what God 430 will do 6213-4 for me.

22:4 And he brought 5148-55 them before 6440 the king 4428 of Moab: 4124 and they dwelt 3427-4 with him all the while 3117 that David 1732 was in the hold. 4686

22:5 And the prophet 5030 Gad 1410 said 559-4 unto David, 1732 Abide 3427-4 not in the hold; 4686 depart, 3212-3 and get 935-1 thee into the land 776 of Judah. 3063 Then David 1732 departed, 3212-4 and came 935-4 into the forest 3293 of Hareth. 2802

22:6 When Saul 7586 heard 8085-4 that David 1732 was discovered, 3045-8 and the men 582 that [were] with him, (now Saul 7586 abode 3427-6 in Gibeah 1390 under a tree 815 in Ramah, 7414 having his spear 2595 in his hand, 3027 and all his servants 5650 [were] standing 5324-12 about him;)

22:7 Then Saul 7586 said 559-4 unto his servants 5650 that stood 5324-12 about him, Hear 8085-3 now, ye Benjamites; 1145 will the son 1121 of Jesse 3448 give 5414-4 every one of you fields 7704 and vineyards, 3754 [and] make 7760-4 you all captains 8269 of thousands, 505 and captains 8269 of hundreds; 3967

22:8 That all of you have conspired 7194-1 against me, and [there is] none that sheweth 1540-6 me 241 that my son 1121 hath made a league 3772-2 with the son 1121 of Jesse, 3448 and [there is] none of you that is sorry 2470-6 for me, or sheweth 1540-6 unto me 241 that my son 1121 hath stirred up 6965-52 my servant 5650 against me, to lie in wait, 693-6 as at this day? 3117

22:9 Then answered 6030-4 Doeg 1673 the Edomite, 130 which was set over 5324-12 the servants 5650 of Saul, 7586 and said, 559-4 I saw 7200-1 the son 1121 of Jesse 3448 coming 935-6 to Nob, 5011 to Ahimelech 288 the son 1121 of Ahitub. 285

22:10 And he enquired 7592-4 of the LORD 3068 for him, and gave 5414-1 him victuals, 6720 and gave 5414-1 him the sword 2719 of Goliath 1555 the Philistine. 6430

22:11 Then the king 4428 sent 7971-4 to call 7121-2 Ahimelech 288 the priest, 3548 the son 1121 of Ahitub, 285 and all his father's 1 house, 1004 the priests 3548 that [were] in Nob: 5011 and they came 935-4 all of them to the king. 4428

22:12 And Saul 7586 said, 559-4 Hear 8085-3 now, thou son 1121 of Ahitub. 285 And he answered, 559-4 Here I [am], my lord. 113

22:13 And Saul 7586 said 559-4 unto him, Why have ye conspired 7194-1 against me, thou and the son 1121 of Jesse, 3448 in that thou hast given 5414-2 him bread, 3899 and a sword, 2719 and hast enquired 7592-2 of God 430 for him, that he should rise 6965-2 against me, to lie in wait, 693-6 as at this day? 3117

22:14 Then Ahimelech 288 answered 6030-4 the king, 4428 and said, 559-4 And who [is so] faithful 539-12 among all thy servants 5650 as David, 1732 which is the king's 4428 son in law, 2860 and goeth 5493-1 at thy bidding, 4928 and is honourable 3513-12 in thine house? 1004

22:15 Did I then 3117 begin 2490-52 to enquire 7592-2 of God 430 for him? be it far 2486 from me: let not the king 4428 impute 7760-4 [any] thing 1697 unto his servant, 5650 [nor] to all the house 1004 of my father: 1 for thy servant 5650 knew 3045-1 nothing 1697 of all this, less 6996 or more. 1419

22:16 And the king 4428 said, 559-4 Thou shalt surely 4191-2 die, 4191-4 Ahimelech, 288 thou, and all thy father's 1 house. 1004

22:17 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto the footmen 7323-5 that stood 5324-12 about him, Turn, 5437-3 and slay 4191-54 the priests 3548 of the LORD; 3068 because their hand 3027 also [is] with David, 1732 and because they knew 3045-1 when he fled, 1272-6 and did not shew 1540-1 it to me. 241 But the servants 5650 of the king 4428 would 14-1 not put forth 7971-2 their hand 3027 to fall 6293-2 upon the priests 3548 of the LORD. 3068

22:18 And the king 4428 said 559-4 to Doeg, 1673 Turn 5437-3 thou, and fall 6293-3 upon the priests. 3548 And Doeg 1673 the Edomite 130 turned, 5437-11 and he fell 6293-4 upon the priests, 3548 and slew 4191-55 on that day 3117 fourscore 8084 and five 2568 persons 376 that did wear 5375-6 a linen 906 ephod. 646

22:19 And Nob, 5011 the city 5892 of the priests, 3548 smote 5221-52 he with the edge 6310 of the sword, 2719 both men 376 and women, 802 children 5768 and sucklings, 3243-6 and oxen, 7794 and asses, 2543 and sheep, 7716 with the edge 6310 of the sword. 2719

22:20 And one 259 of the sons 1121 of Ahimelech 288 the son 1121 of Ahitub, 285 named 8034 Abiathar, 54 escaped, 4422-11 and fled 1272-4 after 310 David. 1732

22:21 And Abiathar 54 shewed 5046-55 David 1732 that Saul 7586 had slain 2026-1 the LORD'S 3068 priests. 3548

22:22 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto Abiathar, 54 I knew 3045-1 [it] that day, 3117 when Doeg 1673 the Edomite 130 [was] there, that he would surely 5046-53 tell 5046-55 Saul: 7586 I have occasioned 5437-1 [the death] of all the persons 5315 of thy father's 1 house. 1004

22:23 Abide 3427-3 thou with me, fear 3372-4 not: for he that seeketh 1245-17 my life 5315 seeketh 1245-17 thy life: 5315 but with me thou [shalt be] in safeguard. 4931

23:1 Then they told 5046-55 David, 1732 saying, 559-2 Behold, the Philistines 6430 fight 3898-12 against Keilah, 7084 and they rob 8154-6 the threshingfloors. 1637

23:2 Therefore David 1732 enquired 7592-4 of the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 Shall I go 3212-4 and smite 5221-52 these Philistines? 6430 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto David, 1732 Go, 3212-3 and smite 5221-52 the Philistines, 6430 and save 3467-52 Keilah. 7084

23:3 And David's 1732 men 582 said 559-4 unto him, Behold, we be afraid 3373 here in Judah: 3063 how much more then if we come 3212-4 to Keilah 7084 against the armies 4634 of the Philistines? 6430

23:4 Then David 1732 enquired 7592-2 of the LORD 3068 yet again. 3254-55 And the LORD 3068 answered 6030-4 him and said, 559-4 Arise, 6965-3 go down 3381-3 to Keilah; 7084 for I will deliver 5414-6 the Philistines 6430 into thine hand. 3027

23:5 So David 1732 and his men 582 went 3212-4 to Keilah, 7084 and fought 3898-11 with the Philistines, 6430 and brought away 5090-4 their cattle, 4735 and smote 5221-55 them with a great 1419 slaughter. 4347 So David 1732 saved 3467-55 the inhabitants 3427-6 of Keilah. 7084

23:6 And it came to pass, when Abiathar 54 the son 1121 of Ahimelech 288 fled 1272-2 to David 1732 to Keilah, 7084 [that] he came down 3381-1 [with] an ephod 646 in his hand. 3027

23:7 And it was told 5046-93 Saul 7586 that David 1732 was come 935-1 to Keilah. 7084 And Saul 7586 said, 559-4 God 430 hath delivered 5234-14 him into mine hand; 3027 for he is shut in, 5462-8 by entering 935-2 into a town 5892 that hath gates 1817 and bars. 1280

23:8 And Saul 7586 called all the people 5971 together 8085-17 to war, 4421 to go down 3381-2 to Keilah, 7084 to besiege 6696-2 David 1732 and his men. 582

23:9 And David 1732 knew 3045-4 that Saul 7586 secretly practised 2790-56 mischief 7451 against him; and he said 559-4 to Abiathar 54 the priest, 3548 Bring hither 5066-54 the ephod. 646

23:10 Then said 559-4 David, 1732 O LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 thy servant 5650 hath certainly 8085-2 heard 8085-1 that Saul 7586 seeketh 1245-18 to come 935-2 to Keilah, 7084 to destroy 7843-15 the city 5892 for my sake.

23:11 Will the men 1167 of Keilah 7084 deliver me up 5462-55 into his hand? 3027 will Saul 7586 come down, 3381-4 as thy servant 5650 hath heard? 8085-1 O LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 I beseech thee, tell 5046-54 thy servant. 5650 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 He will come down. 3381-4

23:12 Then said 559-4 David, 1732 Will the men 1167 of Keilah 7084 deliver 5462-55 me and my men 582 into the hand 3027 of Saul? 7586 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 They will deliver [thee] up. 5462-55

23:13 Then David 1732 and his men, 582 [which were] about six 8337 hundred, 3967 376 arose 6965-4 and departed 3318-4 out of Keilah, 7084 and went 1980-101 whithersoever 834 they could go. 1980-101 And it was told 5046-90 Saul 7586 that David 1732 was escaped 4422-8 from Keilah; 7084 and he forbare 2308-4 to go forth. 3318-2

23:14 And David 1732 abode 3427-4 in the wilderness 4057 in strong holds, 4679 and remained 3427-4 in a mountain 2022 in the wilderness 4057 of Ziph. 2128 And Saul 7586 sought 1245-17 him every day, 3117 but God 430 delivered 5414-1 him not into his hand. 3027

23:15 And David 1732 saw 7200-4 that Saul 7586 was come out 3318-1 to seek 1245-15 his life: 5315 and David 1732 [was] in the wilderness 4057 of Ziph 2128 in a wood. 2793

23:16 And Jonathan 3083 Saul's 7586 son 1121 arose, 6965-4 and went 3212-4 to David 1732 into the wood, 2793 and strengthened 2388-17 his hand 3027 in God. 430

23:17 And he said 559-4 unto him, Fear 3372-4 not: for the hand 3027 of Saul 7586 my father 1 shall not find 4672-4 thee; and thou shalt be king 4427-4 over Israel, 3478 and I shall be next 4932 unto thee; and that also Saul 7586 my father 1 knoweth. 3045-6

23:18 And they two 8147 made 3772-4 a covenant 1285 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 and David 1732 abode 3427-4 in the wood, 2793 and Jonathan 3083 went 1980-1 to his house. 1004

23:19 Then came up 5927-4 the Ziphites 2130 to Saul 7586 to Gibeah, 1390 saying, 559-2 Doth not David 1732 hide 5641-102 himself with us in strong holds 4679 in the wood, 2793 in the hill 1389 of Hachilah, 2444 which [is] on the south 3225 of Jeshimon? 3452

23:20 Now therefore, O king, 4428 come down 3381-3 according to all the desire of 185 thy soul 5315 to come down; 3381-2 and our part [shall be] to deliver 5462-53 him into the king's 4428 hand. 3027

23:21 And Saul 7586 said, 559-4 Blessed 1288-7 [be] ye of the LORD; 3068 for ye have compassion 2550-1 on me.

23:22 Go, 3212-3 I pray you, prepare 3559-54 yet, and know 3045-3 and see 7200-3 his place 4725 where his haunt 7272 is, [and] who hath seen 7200-1 him there: for it is told 559-1 me [that] he dealeth very 6191-2 subtilly. 6191-55

23:23 See 7200-3 therefore, and take knowledge 3045-3 of all the lurking places 4224 where he hideth 2244-101 himself, and come ye again 7725-1 to me with the certainty, 3559-12 and I will go 1980-1 with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be 3426 in the land, 776 that I will search him out 2664-14 throughout all the thousands 505 of Judah. 3063

23:24 And they arose, 6965-4 and went 3212-4 to Ziph 2128 before 6440 Saul: 7586 but David 1732 and his men 582 [were] in the wilderness 4057 of Maon, 4584 in the plain 6160 on the south 3225 of Jeshimon. 3452

23:25 Saul 7586 also and his men 582 went 3212-4 to seek 1245-15 [him]. And they told 5046-55 David: 1732 wherefore he came down 3381-4 into a rock, 5553 and abode 3427-4 in the wilderness 4057 of Maon. 4584 And when Saul 7586 heard 8085-4 [that], he pursued 7291-4 after 310 David 1732 in the wilderness 4057 of Maon. 4584

23:26 And Saul 7586 went 3212-4 on this side 6654 of the mountain, 2022 and David 1732 and his men 582 on that side 6654 of the mountain: 2022 and David 1732 made haste 2648-12 to get away 3212-2 for fear 6440 of Saul; 7586 for Saul 7586 and his men 582 compassed 5849-6 David 1732 and his men 582 round about to take 8610-2 them.

23:27 But there came 935-1 a messenger 4397 unto Saul, 7586 saying, 559-2 Haste 4116-16 thee, and come; 3212-3 for the Philistines 6430 have invaded 6584-1 the land. 776

23:28 Wherefore Saul 7586 returned 7725-4 from pursuing 7291-2 after 310 David, 1732 and went 3212-4 against 7125-2 the Philistines: 6430 therefore they called 7121-1 that place 4725 Selahammahlekoth. 5555

23:29 And David 1732 went up 5927-4 from thence, and dwelt 3427-4 in strong holds 4679 at Engedi. 5872

24:1 And it came to pass, when Saul 7586 was returned 7725-1 from following 310 the Philistines, 6430 that it was told 5046-55 him, saying, 559-2 Behold, David 1732 [is] in the wilderness 4057 of Engedi. 5872

24:2 Then Saul 7586 took 3947-4 three 7969 thousand 505 chosen 977-7 men 376 out of all Israel, 3478 and went 3212-4 to seek 1245-15 David 1732 and his men 582 upon 6440 the rocks 6697 of the wild goats. 3277

24:3 And he came 935-4 to the sheepcotes 1448 6629 by the way, 1870 where [was] a cave; 4631 and Saul 7586 went in 935-4 to cover 5526-53 his feet: 7272 and David 1732 and his men 582 remained 3427-6 in the sides 3411 of the cave. 4631

24:4 And the men 582 of David 1732 said 559-4 unto him, Behold the day 3117 of which the LORD 3068 said 559-1 unto thee, Behold, I will deliver 5414-6 thine enemy 341-6 into thine hand, 3027 that thou mayest do 6213-1 to him as it shall seem good 3190-4 unto thee. 5869 Then David 1732 arose, 6965-4 and cut off 3772-4 the skirt 3671 of Saul's 7586 robe 4598 privily. 3909

24:5 And it came to pass afterward, 310 that David's 1732 heart 3820 smote 5221-55 him, because he had cut off 3772-1 Saul's 7586 skirt. 3671

24:6 And he said 559-4 unto his men, 582 The LORD 3068 forbid 2486 that I should do 6213-4 this thing 1697 unto my master, 113 the LORD'S 3068 anointed, 4899 to stretch forth 7971-2 mine hand 3027 against him, seeing he [is] the anointed 4899 of the LORD. 3068

24:7 So David 1732 stayed 8156-17 his servants 582 with these words, 1697 and suffered 5414-1 them not to rise 6965-2 against Saul. 7586 But Saul 7586 rose up 6965-1 out of the cave, 4631 and went 3212-4 on [his] way. 1870

24:8 David 1732 also arose 6965-4 afterward, 310 and went out 3318-4 of the cave, 4631 and cried 7121-4 after 310 Saul, 7586 saying, 559-2 My lord 113 the king. 4428 And when Saul 7586 looked 5027-55 behind 310 him, David 1732 stooped 6915-4 with his face 639 to the earth, 776 and bowed 7812-101 himself.

24:9 And David 1732 said 559-4 to Saul, 7586 Wherefore hearest 8085-4 thou men's 120 words, 1697 saying, 559-2 Behold, David 1732 seeketh 1245-18 thy hurt? 7451

24:10 Behold, this day 3117 thine eyes 5869 have seen 7200-1 how that the LORD 3068 had delivered 5414-1 thee to day 3117 into mine hand 3027 in the cave: 4631 and [some] bade 559-1 [me] kill 2026-2 thee: but [mine eye] spared 2347-4 thee; and I said, 559-4 I will not put forth 7971-4 mine hand 3027 against my lord; 113 for he [is] the LORD'S 3068 anointed. 4899

24:11 Moreover, my father, 1 see, 7200-3 yea, see 7200-3 the skirt 3671 of thy robe 4598 in my hand: 3027 for in that I cut off 3772-2 the skirt 3671 of thy robe, 4598 and killed 2026-1 thee not, know 3045-3 thou and see 7200-3 that [there is] neither evil 7451 nor transgression 6588 in mine hand, 3027 and I have not sinned 2398-1 against thee; yet thou huntest 6658-6 my soul 5315 to take 3947-2 it.

24:12 The LORD 3068 judge 8199-4 between me and thee, and the LORD 3068 avenge 5358-1 me of thee: but mine hand 3027 shall not be upon thee.

24:13 As saith 559-4 the proverb 4912 of the ancients, 6931 Wickedness 7562 proceedeth 3318-4 from the wicked: 7563 but mine hand 3027 shall not be upon thee.

24:14 After 310 whom is the king 4428 of Israel 3478 come out? 3318-1 after 310 whom dost thou pursue? 7291-6 after 310 a dead 4191-5 dog, 3611 after 310 a 259 flea. 6550

24:15 The LORD 3068 therefore be judge, 1781 and judge 8199-1 between me and thee, and see, 7200-4 and plead 7378-4 my cause, 7379 and deliver 8199-4 me out of thine hand. 3027

24:16 And it came to pass, when David 1732 had made an end 3615-15 of speaking 1696-15 these words 1697 unto Saul, 7586 that Saul 7586 said, 559-4 [Is] this thy voice, 6963 my son 1121 David? 1732 And Saul 7586 lifted up 5375-4 his voice, 6963 and wept. 1058-4

24:17 And he said 559-4 to David, 1732 Thou [art] more righteous 6662 than I: for thou hast rewarded 1580-1 me good, 2896 whereas I have rewarded 1580-1 thee evil. 7451

24:18 And thou hast shewed 5046-52 this day 3117 how that thou hast dealt 6213-1 well 2896 with me: forasmuch as when the LORD 3068 had delivered 5462-14 me into thine hand, 3027 thou killedst 2026-1 me not.

24:19 For if a man 376 find 4672-4 his enemy, 341-6 will he let him go 7971-14 well 2896 away? 1870 wherefore the LORD 3068 reward 7999-17 thee good 2896 for that thou hast done 6213-1 unto me this day. 3117

24:20 And now, behold, I know 3045-1 well that thou shalt surely 4427-2 be king, 4427-4 and that the kingdom 4467 of Israel 3478 shall be established 6965-1 in thine hand. 3027

24:21 Swear 7650-10 now therefore unto me by the LORD, 3068 that thou wilt not 518 cut off 3772-55 my seed 2233 after 310 me, and that thou wilt not destroy 8045-55 my name 8034 out of my father's 1 house. 1004

24:22 And David 1732 sware 7650-11 unto Saul. 7586 And Saul 7586 went 3212-4 home; 1004 but David 1732 and his men 582 gat them up 5927-1 unto the hold. 4686

25:1 And Samuel 8050 died; 4191-4 and all the Israelites 3478 were gathered together, 6908-11 and lamented 5594-4 him, and buried 6912-4 him in his house 1004 at Ramah. 7414 And David 1732 arose, 6965-4 and went down 3381-4 to the wilderness 4057 of Paran. 6290

25:2 And [there was] a man 376 in Maon, 4584 whose possessions 4639 [were] in Carmel; 3760 and the man 376 [was] very 3966 great, 1419 and he had three 7969 thousand 505 sheep, 6629 and a thousand 505 goats: 5795 and he was shearing 1494-2 his sheep 6629 in Carmel. 3760

25:3 Now the name 8034 of the man 376 [was] Nabal; 5037 and the name 8034 of his wife 802 Abigail: 26 and [she was] a woman 802 of good 2896 understanding, 7922 and of a beautiful 3303 countenance: 8389 but the man 376 [was] churlish 7186 and evil 7451 in his doings; 4611 and he [was] of the house of Caleb. 3614

25:4 And David 1732 heard 8085-4 in the wilderness 4057 that Nabal 5037 did shear 1494-6 his sheep. 6629

25:5 And David 1732 sent 7971-4 out ten 6235 young men, 5288 and David 1732 said 559-4 unto the young men, 5288 Get you up 5927-3 to Carmel, 3760 and go 935-1 to Nabal, 5037 and greet 7592-1 7965 him in my name: 8034

25:6 And thus shall ye say 559-1 to him that liveth 2416 [in prosperity], Peace 7965 [be] both to thee, and peace 7965 [be] to thine house, 1004 and peace 7965 [be] unto all that thou hast.

25:7 And now I have heard 8085-1 that thou hast shearers: 1494-6 now thy shepherds 7462-6 which were with us, we hurt 3637-52 them not, neither was there ought 3972 missing 6485-8 unto them, all the while 3117 they were in Carmel. 3760

25:8 Ask 7592-3 thy young men, 5288 and they will shew 5046-55 thee. Wherefore let the young men 5288 find 4672-4 favour 2580 in thine eyes: 5869 for we come 935-1 in a good 2896 day: 3117 give, 5414-3 I pray thee, whatsoever cometh 4672-4 to thine hand 3027 unto thy servants, 5650 and to thy son 1121 David. 1732

25:9 And when David's 1732 young men 5288 came, 935-4 they spake 1696-17 to Nabal 5037 according to all those words 1697 in the name 8034 of David, 1732 and ceased. 5117-4

25:10 And Nabal 5037 answered 6030-4 David's 1732 servants, 5650 and said, 559-4 Who [is] David? 1732 and who [is] the son 1121 of Jesse? 3448 there be many 7231-1 servants 5650 now a days 3117 that break away 6555-102 every man 376 from 6440 his master. 113

25:11 Shall I then take 3947-1 my bread, 3899 and my water, 4325 and my flesh 2878 that I have killed 2873-1 for my shearers, 1494-6 and give 5414-1 [it] unto men, 582 whom I know 3045-1 not whence they [be]?

25:12 So David's 1732 young men 5288 turned 2015-4 their way, 1870 and went again, 7725-4 and came 935-4 and told 5046-55 him all those sayings. 1697

25:13 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto his men, 582 Gird ye on 2296-3 every man 376 his sword. 2719 And they girded on 2296-4 every man 376 his sword; 2719 and David 1732 also girded on 2296-4 his sword: 2719 and there went up 5927-4 after 310 David 1732 about four 702 hundred 3967 men; 376 and two hundred 3967 abode 3427-1 by the stuff. 3627

25:14 But one 259 5288 of the young men 5288 told 5046-52 Abigail, 26 Nabal's 5037 wife, 802 saying, 559-2 Behold, David 1732 sent 7971-1 messengers 4397 out of the wilderness 4057 to salute 1288-15 our master; 113 and he railed 5860-4 on them.

25:15 But the men 582 [were] very 3966 good 2896 unto us, and we were not hurt, 3637-90 neither missed 6485-1 we any thing, 3972 as long as 3117 we were conversant 1980-98 with them, when we were in the fields: 7704

25:16 They were a wall 2346 unto us both by night 3915 and day, 3119 all the while 3117 we were with them keeping 7462-6 the sheep. 6629

25:17 Now therefore know 3045-3 and consider 7200-3 what thou wilt do; 6213-4 for evil 7451 is determined 3615-1 against our master, 113 and against all his household: 1004 for he [is such] a son 1121 of Belial, 1100 that [a man] cannot speak 1696-15 to him.

25:18 Then Abigail 26 made haste, 4116-17 and took 3947-4 two hundred 3967 loaves, 3899 and two 8147 bottles 5035 of wine, 3196 and five 2568 sheep 6629 ready dressed, 6213-7 and five 2568 measures 5429 of parched 7039 [corn], and an hundred 3967 clusters of raisins, 6778 and two hundred 3967 cakes 1690 of figs, and laid 7760-4 [them] on asses. 2543

25:19 And she said 559-4 unto her servants, 5288 Go on 5674-3 before 6440 me; behold, I come 935-6 after 310 you. But she told 5046-52 not her husband 376 Nabal. 5037

25:20 And it was [so, as] she rode 7392-6 on the ass, 2543 that she came down 3381-6 by the covert 5643 of the hill, 2022 and, behold, David 1732 and his men 582 came down 3381-6 against 7125-2 her; and she met 6298-4 them.

25:21 Now David 1732 had said, 559-1 Surely in vain 8267 have I kept 8104-1 all that this 2088 [fellow] hath in the wilderness, 4057 so that nothing 3808 3972 was missed 6485-8 of all that [pertained] unto him: and he hath requited 7725-55 me evil 7451 for good. 2896

25:22 So 3541 and more 3254-55 also 3541 do 6213-4 God 430 unto the enemies 341-6 of David, 1732 if I leave 7604-55 of all that [pertain] to him by 5704 the morning 1242 light 216 any that pisseth 8366-56 against the wall. 7023

25:23 And when Abigail 26 saw 7200-4 David, 1732 she hasted, 4116-17 and lighted 3381-4 off the ass, 2543 and fell 5307-4 before 639 David 1732 on her face, 6440 and bowed 7812-101 herself to the ground, 776

25:24 And fell 5307-4 at his feet, 7272 and said, 559-4 Upon me, my lord, 113 [upon] me 589 [let this] iniquity 5771 [be]: and let thine handmaid, 519 I pray thee, speak 1696-17 in thine audience, 241 and hear 8085-3 the words 1697 of thine handmaid. 519

25:25 Let 7760-4 not my lord, 113 I pray thee, regard 3820 this man 376 of Belial, 1100 [even] Nabal: 5037 for as his name 8034 [is], so [is] he; Nabal 5037 [is] his name, 8034 and folly 5039 [is] with him: but I thine handmaid 519 saw 7200-1 not the young men 5288 of my lord, 113 whom thou didst send. 7971-1

25:26 Now therefore, my lord, 113 [as] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 and [as] thy soul 5315 liveth, 2416 seeing the LORD 3068 hath withholden 4513-1 thee from coming 935-2 to [shed] blood, 1818 and from avenging 3467-53 thyself with thine own hand, 3027 now let thine enemies, 341-6 and they that seek 1245-18 evil 7451 to my lord, 113 be as Nabal. 5037

25:27 And now this blessing 1293 which thine handmaid 8198 hath brought 935-52 unto my lord, 113 let it even be given 5414-8 unto the young men 5288 that follow 1980-102 7272 my lord. 113

25:28 I pray thee, forgive 5375-3 the trespass 6588 of thine handmaid: 519 for the LORD 3068 will certainly 6213-2 make 6213-4 my lord 113 a sure 539-12 house; 1004 because my lord 113 fighteth 3898-12 the battles 4421 of the LORD, 3068 and evil 7451 hath not been found 4672-11 in thee [all] thy days. 3117

25:29 Yet a man 120 is risen 6965-4 to pursue 7291-2 thee, and to seek 1245-15 thy soul: 5315 but the soul 5315 of my lord 113 shall be bound 6887-7 in the bundle 6872 of life 2416 with the LORD 3068 thy God; 430 and the souls 5315 of thine enemies, 341-6 them shall he sling out, 7049-17 [as out] of the middle 8432 3709 of a sling. 7050

25:30 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD 3068 shall have done 6213-4 to my lord 113 according to all the good 2896 that he hath spoken 1696-14 concerning thee, and shall have appointed 6680-14 thee ruler 5057 over Israel; 3478

25:31 That this shall be no grief 6330 unto thee, nor offence 4383 of heart 3820 unto my lord, 113 either that thou hast shed 8210-2 blood 1818 causeless, 2600 or that my lord 113 hath avenged 3467-53 himself: but when the LORD 3068 shall have dealt well 3190-52 with my lord, 113 then remember 2142-1 thine handmaid. 519

25:32 And David 1732 said 559-4 to Abigail, 26 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 which sent 7971-1 thee this day 3117 to meet 7125-2 me:

25:33 And blessed 1288-7 [be] thy advice, 2940 and blessed 1288-7 [be] thou, which hast kept 3607-1 me this day 3117 from coming 935-2 to [shed] blood, 1818 and from avenging 3467-53 myself with mine own hand. 3027

25:34 For in very deed, 199 [as] the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 liveth, 2416 which hath kept me back 4513-1 from hurting 7489-53 thee, except 3884 thou hadst hasted 4116-14 and come 935-4 to meet 7125-2 me, surely there had not been left 3498-8 unto Nabal 5037 by the morning 1242 light 216 any that pisseth 8366-56 against the wall. 7023

25:35 So David 1732 received 3947-4 of her hand 3027 [that] which she had brought 935-52 him, and said 559-1 unto her, Go up 5927-3 in peace 7965 to thine house; 1004 see, 7200-3 I have hearkened 8085-1 to thy voice, 6963 and have accepted 5375-4 thy person. 6440

25:36 And Abigail 26 came 935-4 to Nabal; 5037 and, behold, he held a feast 4960 in his house, 1004 like the feast 4960 of a king; 4428 and Nabal's 5037 heart 3820 [was] merry 2896 within him, for he [was] very 3966 drunken: 7910 wherefore she told 5046-52 him nothing, 1697 less 6996 or more, 1419 until the morning 1242 light. 216

25:37 But it came to pass in the morning, 1242 when the wine 3196 was gone out 3318-2 of Nabal, 5037 and his wife 802 had told 5046-55 him these things, 1697 that his heart 3820 died 4191-4 within 7130 him, and he became [as] a stone. 68

25:38 And it came to pass about ten 6235 days 3117 [after], that the LORD 3068 smote 5062-4 Nabal, 5037 that he died. 4191-4

25:39 And when David 1732 heard 8085-4 that Nabal 5037 was dead, 4191-1 he said, 559-4 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD, 3068 that hath pleaded 7378-1 the cause 7379 of my reproach 2781 from the hand 3027 of Nabal, 5037 and hath kept 2820-1 his servant 5650 from evil: 7451 for the LORD 3068 hath returned 7725-52 the wickedness 7451 of Nabal 5037 upon his own head. 7218 And David 1732 sent 7971-4 and communed 1696-17 with Abigail, 26 to take 3947-2 her to him to wife. 802

25:40 And when the servants 5650 of David 1732 were come 935-4 to Abigail 26 to Carmel, 3760 they spake 1696-17 unto her, saying, 559-2 David 1732 sent 7971-1 us unto thee, to take 3947-2 thee to him to wife. 802

25:41 And she arose, 6965-4 and bowed 7812-101 herself on [her] face 639 to the earth, 776 and said, 559-4 Behold, [let] thine handmaid 519 [be] a servant 8198 to wash 7364-2 the feet 7272 of the servants 5650 of my lord. 113

25:42 And Abigail 26 hasted, 4116-17 and arose, 6965-4 and rode 7392-4 upon an ass, 2543 with five 2568 damsels 5291 of hers that went 1980-6 after 7272 her; and she went 3212-4 after 310 the messengers 4397 of David, 1732 and became his wife. 802

25:43 David 1732 also took 3947-1 Ahinoam 293 of Jezreel; 3157 and they were also both 8147 of them his wives. 802

25:44 But Saul 7586 had given 5414-1 Michal 4324 his daughter, 1323 David's 1732 wife, 802 to Phalti 6406 the son 1121 of Laish, 3919 which [was] of Gallim. 1554

26:1 And the Ziphites 2130 came 935-4 unto Saul 7586 to Gibeah, 1390 saying, 559-2 Doth not David 1732 hide 5641-102 himself in the hill 1389 of Hachilah, 2444 [which is] before 6440 Jeshimon? 3452

26:2 Then Saul 7586 arose, 6965-4 and went down 3381-4 to the wilderness 4057 of Ziph, 2128 having three 7969 thousand 505 chosen 977-7 men 376 of Israel 3478 with him, to seek 1245-15 David 1732 in the wilderness 4057 of Ziph. 2128

26:3 And Saul 7586 pitched 2583-4 in the hill 1389 of Hachilah, 2444 which [is] before 6440 Jeshimon, 3452 by the way. 1870 But David 1732 abode 3427-6 in the wilderness, 4057 and he saw 7200-4 that Saul 7586 came 935-1 after 310 him into the wilderness. 4057

26:4 David 1732 therefore sent 7971-4 out spies, 7270-18 and understood 3045-4 that Saul 7586 was come 935-1 in very deed. 3559-12

26:5 And David 1732 arose, 6965-4 and came 935-4 to the place 4725 where Saul 7586 had pitched: 2583-1 and David 1732 beheld 7200-4 the place 4725 where Saul 7586 lay, 7901-1 and Abner 74 the son 1121 of Ner, 5369 the captain 8269 of his host: 6635 and Saul 7586 lay 7901-6 in the trench, 4570 and the people 5971 pitched 2583-6 round about 5439 him.

26:6 Then answered 6030-4 David 1732 and said 559-4 to Ahimelech 288 the Hittite, 2850 and to Abishai 52 the son 1121 of Zeruiah, 6870 brother 251 to Joab, 3097 saying, 559-2 Who will go down 3381-4 with me to Saul 7586 to the camp? 4264 And Abishai 52 said, 559-4 I will go down 3381-4 with thee.

26:7 So David 1732 and Abishai 52 came 935-4 to the people 5971 by night: 3915 and, behold, Saul 7586 lay 7901-6 sleeping 3463 within the trench, 4570 and his spear 2595 stuck 4600-7 in the ground 776 at his bolster: 4763 but Abner 74 and the people 5971 lay 7901-6 round about 5439 him.

26:8 Then said 559-4 Abishai 52 to David, 1732 God 430 hath delivered 5462-14 thine enemy 341-6 into thine hand 3027 this day: 3117 now therefore let me smite 5221-55 him, I pray thee, with the spear 2595 even to the earth 776 at once, 6471 259 and I will not [smite] him the second time. 8138-4

26:9 And David 1732 said 559-4 to Abishai, 52 Destroy 7843-55 him not: for who can stretch forth 7971-1 his hand 3027 against the LORD'S 3068 anointed, 4899 and be guiltless? 5352-8

26:10 David 1732 said 559-4 furthermore, [As] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 the LORD 3068 shall smite 5062-4 him; or his day 3117 shall come 935-4 to die; 4191-1 or he shall descend 3381-4 into battle, 4421 and perish. 5595-8

26:11 The LORD 3068 forbid 2486 that I should stretch forth 7971-2 mine hand 3027 against the LORD'S 3068 anointed: 4899 but, I pray thee, take 3947-3 thou now the spear 2595 that [is] at his bolster, 4763 and the cruse 6835 of water, 4325 and let us go. 3212-4

26:12 So David 1732 took 3947-4 the spear 2595 and the cruse 6835 of water 4325 from Saul's 7586 bolster; 7226 and they gat them away, 3212-4 and no man saw 7200-6 [it], nor knew 3045-6 [it], neither awaked: 6974-56 for they [were] all asleep; 3463 because a deep sleep 8639 from the LORD 3068 was fallen 5307-1 upon them.

26:13 Then David 1732 went over 5674-4 to the other side, 5676 and stood 5975-4 on the top 7218 of an hill 2022 afar off; 7350 a great 7227 space 4725 [being] between them:

26:14 And David 1732 cried 7121-4 to the people, 5971 and to Abner 74 the son 1121 of Ner, 5369 saying, 559-2 Answerest 6030-4 thou not, Abner? 74 Then Abner 74 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 Who [art] thou [that] criest 7121-1 to the king? 4428

26:15 And David 1732 said 559-4 to Abner, 74 [Art] not thou a [valiant] man? 376 and who [is] like to thee in Israel? 3478 wherefore then hast thou not kept 8104-1 thy lord 113 the king? 4428 for there came 935-1 one 259 of the people 5971 in to destroy 7843-53 the king 4428 thy lord. 113

26:16 This thing 1697 [is] not good 2896 that thou hast done. 6213-1 [As] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 ye [are] worthy 1121 to die, 4194 because ye have not kept 8104-1 your master, 113 the LORD'S 3068 anointed. 4899 And now see 7200-3 where the king's 4428 spear 2595 [is], and the cruse 6835 of water 4325 that [was] at his bolster. 4763

26:17 And Saul 7586 knew 5234-55 David's 1732 voice, 6963 and said, 559-4 [Is] this thy voice, 6963 my son 1121 David? 1732 And David 1732 said, 559-4 [It is] my voice, 6963 my lord, 113 O king. 4428

26:18 And he said, 559-4 Wherefore doth my lord 113 thus pursue 7291-6 after 310 his servant? 5650 for what have I done? 6213-1 or what evil 7451 [is] in mine hand? 3027

26:19 Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord 113 the king 4428 hear 8085-4 the words 1697 of his servant. 5650 If the LORD 3068 have stirred thee up 5496-52 against me, let him accept 7306-55 an offering: 4503 but if [they be] the children 1121 of men, 120 cursed 779-7 [be] they before 6440 the LORD; 3068 for they have driven me out 1644-14 this day 3117 from abiding 5596-99 in the inheritance 5159 of the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 Go, 3212-3 serve 5647-3 other 312 gods. 430

26:20 Now therefore, let not my blood 1818 fall 5307-4 to the earth 776 before the face 6440 of the LORD: 3068 for the king 4428 of Israel 3478 is come out 3318-1 to seek 1245-15 a 259 flea, 6550 as when one doth hunt 7291-4 a partridge 7124 in the mountains. 2022

26:21 Then said 559-4 Saul, 7586 I have sinned: 2398-1 return, 7725-3 my son 1121 David: 1732 for I will no more do thee harm, 7489-55 because my soul 5315 was precious 3365-1 in thine eyes 5869 this day: 3117 behold, I have played the fool, 5528-52 and have erred 7686-4 exceedingly. 7235-53 3966

26:22 And David 1732 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 Behold the king's 4428 spear! 2595 and let one 259 of the young men 5288 come over 5674-4 and fetch 3947-4 it.

26:23 The LORD 3068 render 7725-55 to every man 376 his righteousness 6663 and his faithfulness: 530 for the LORD 3068 delivered 5414-1 thee into [my] hand 3027 to day, 3117 but I would 14-1 not stretch forth 7971-2 mine hand 3027 against the LORD'S 3068 anointed. 4899

26:24 And, behold, as thy life 5315 was much set by 1431-1 this day 3117 in mine eyes, 5869 so let my life 5315 be much set by 1431-4 in the eyes 5869 of the LORD, 3068 and let him deliver 5337-55 me out of all tribulation. 6869

26:25 Then Saul 7586 said 559-4 to David, 1732 Blessed 1288-7 [be] thou, my son 1121 David: 1732 thou shalt both do 6213-4 great 6213-2 [things], and also shalt still 3201-2 prevail. 3201-4 So David 1732 went 3212-4 on his way, 1870 and Saul 7586 returned 7725-1 to his place. 4725

27:1 And David 1732 said 559-4 in his heart, 3820 I shall now perish 5595-11 one 259 day 3117 by the hand 3027 of Saul: 7586 [there is] nothing better 2896 for me than that 3588 I should speedily 4422-9 escape 4422-11 into the land 776 of the Philistines; 6430 and Saul 7586 shall despair 2976-8 of me, to seek 1245-15 me any more in any coast 1366 of Israel: 3478 so shall I escape 4422-8 out of his hand. 3027

27:2 And David 1732 arose, 6965-4 and he passed over 5674-4 with the six 8337 hundred 3967 men 376 that [were] with him unto Achish, 397 the son 1121 of Maoch, 4582 king 4428 of Gath. 1661

27:3 And David 1732 dwelt 3427-4 with Achish 397 at Gath, 1661 he and his men, 582 every man 376 with his household, 1004 [even] David 1732 with his two 8147 wives, 802 Ahinoam 293 the Jezreelitess, 3159 and Abigail 26 the Carmelitess, 3761 Nabal's 5037 wife. 802

27:4 And it was told 5046-93 Saul 7586 that David 1732 was fled 1272-1 to Gath: 1661 and he sought 1245-15 no more again 3254-1|3254-55-k for him.

27:5 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto Achish, 397 If I have now found 4672-1 grace 2580 in thine eyes, 5869 let them give 5414-4 me a place 4725 in some 259 town 5892 in the country, 7704 that I may dwell 3427-4 there: for why should thy servant 5650 dwell 3427-4 in the royal 4467 city 5892 with thee?

27:6 Then Achish 397 gave 5414-4 him Ziklag 6860 that day: 3117 wherefore Ziklag 6860 pertaineth unto the kings 4428 of Judah 3063 unto this day. 3117

27:7 And the time 4557 3117 that David 1732 dwelt 3427-1 in the country 7704 of the Philistines 6430 was a full year 3117 and four 702 months. 2320

27:8 And David 1732 and his men 582 went up, 5927-4 and invaded 6584-4 the Geshurites, 1651 and the Gezrites, 1511 and the Amalekites: 6003 for those 2007 [nations were] of old 5769 the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land, 776 as thou goest 935-2 to Shur, 7793 even unto the land 776 of Egypt. 4714

27:9 And David 1732 smote 5221-52 the land, 776 and left neither man 376 nor woman 802 alive, 2421-17 and took away 3947-1 the sheep, 6629 and the oxen, 1241 and the asses, 2543 and the camels, 1581 and the apparel, 899 and returned, 7725-4 and came 935-4 to Achish. 397

27:10 And Achish 397 said, 559-4 Whither 408 have ye made a road 6584-1 to day? 3117 And David 1732 said, 559-4 Against the south 5045 of Judah, 3063 and against the south 5045 of the Jerahmeelites, 3397 and against the south 5045 of the Kenites. 7017

27:11 And David 1732 saved neither man 376 nor woman 802 alive, 2421-17 to bring 935-53 [tidings] to Gath, 1661 saying, 559-2 Lest they should tell 5046-55 on us, saying, 559-2 So did 6213-1 David, 1732 and so [will be] his manner 4941 all the while 3117 he dwelleth 3427-1 in the country 7704 of the Philistines. 6430

27:12 And Achish 397 believed 539-55 David, 1732 saying, 559-2 He hath made his people 5971 Israel 3478 utterly 887-53 to abhor 887-52 him; therefore he shall be my servant 5650 for ever. 5769

28:1 And it came to pass in those days, 3117 that the Philistines 6430 gathered their armies 4264 together 6908-4 for warfare, 6635 to fight 3898-9 with Israel. 3478 And Achish 397 said 559-4 unto David, 1732 Know 3045-4 thou assuredly, 3045-2 that thou shalt go out 3318-4 with me to battle, 4264 thou and thy men. 582

28:2 And David 1732 said 559-4 to Achish, 397 Surely 3651 thou shalt know 3045-4 what thy servant 5650 can do. 6213-4 And Achish 397 said 559-4 to David, 1732 Therefore will I make 7760-4 thee keeper 8104-6 of mine head 7218 for ever. 3605 3117

28:3 Now Samuel 8050 was dead, 4191-1 and all Israel 3478 had lamented 5594-4 him, and buried 6912-4 him in Ramah, 7414 even in his own city. 5892 And Saul 7586 had put away 5493-52 those that had familiar spirits, 178 and the wizards, 3049 out of the land. 776

28:4 And the Philistines 6430 gathered themselves together, 6908-11 and came 935-4 and pitched 2583-4 in Shunem: 7766 and Saul 7586 gathered all Israel 3478 together, 6908-4 and they pitched 2583-4 in Gilboa. 1533

28:5 And when Saul 7586 saw 7200-4 the host 4264 of the Philistines, 6430 he was afraid, 3372-4 and his heart 3820 greatly 3966 trembled. 2729-4

28:6 And when Saul 7586 enquired 7592-4 of the LORD, 3068 the LORD 3068 answered 6030-1 him not, neither by dreams, 2472 nor by Urim, 224 nor by prophets. 5030

28:7 Then said 559-4 Saul 7586 unto his servants, 5650 Seek 1245-16 me a woman 802 that hath 1172 a familiar spirit, 178 that I may go 3212-4 to her, and enquire 1875-4 of her. And his servants 5650 said 559-4 to him, Behold, [there is] a woman 802 that hath 1172 a familiar spirit 178 at Endor. 5874

28:8 And Saul 7586 disguised 2664-101 himself, and put on 3847-4 other 312 raiment, 899 and he went, 3212-4 and two 8147 men 582 with him, and they came 935-4 to the woman 802 by night: 3915 and he said, 559-4 I pray thee, divine 7080-3 unto me by the familiar spirit, 178 and bring me [him] up, 5927-54 whom I shall name 559-4 unto thee.

28:9 And the woman 802 said 559-4 unto him, Behold, thou knowest 3045-1 what Saul 7586 hath done, 6213-1 how he hath cut off 3772-52 those that have familiar spirits, 178 and the wizards, 3049 out of the land: 776 wherefore then layest thou a snare 5367-102 for my life, 5315 to cause me to die? 4191-53

28:10 And Saul 7586 sware 7650-11 to her by the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 [As] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 there shall no 518 punishment 5771 happen 7136-4 to thee for this thing. 1697

28:11 Then said 559-4 the woman, 802 Whom shall I bring up 5927-55 unto thee? And he said, 559-4 Bring me up 5927-54 Samuel. 8050

28:12 And when the woman 802 saw 7200-4 Samuel, 8050 she cried 2199-4 with a loud 1419 voice: 6963 and the woman 802 spake 559-4 to Saul, 7586 saying, 559-2 Why hast thou deceived 7411-14 me? for thou [art] Saul. 7586

28:13 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto her, Be not afraid: 3372-4 for what sawest 7200-1 thou? And the woman 802 said 559-4 unto Saul, 7586 I saw 7200-1 gods 430 ascending 5927-6 out of the earth. 776

28:14 And he said 559-4 unto her, What form 8389 [is] he of? And she said, 559-4 An old 2205 man 376 cometh up; 5927-6 and he [is] covered 5844-6 with a mantle. 4598 And Saul 7586 perceived 3045-4 that it [was] Samuel, 8050 and he stooped 6915-4 with [his] face 639 to the ground, 776 and bowed 7812-101 himself.

28:15 And Samuel 8050 said 559-4 to Saul, 7586 Why hast thou disquieted 7264-52 me, to bring me up? 5927-53 And Saul 7586 answered, 559-4 I am sore 3966 distressed; 6887-1 for the Philistines 6430 make war 3898-12 against me, and God 430 is departed 5493-1 from me, and answereth 6030-1 me no more, neither by 3027 prophets, 5030 nor by dreams: 2472 therefore I have called 7121-4 thee, that thou mayest make known 3045-53 unto me what I shall do. 6213-4

28:16 Then said 559-4 Samuel, 8050 Wherefore then dost thou ask 7592-4 of me, seeing the LORD 3068 is departed 5493-1 from thee, and is become thine enemy? 6145

28:17 And the LORD 3068 hath done 6213-4 to him, as he spake 1696-14 by me: 3027 for the LORD 3068 hath rent 7167-4 the kingdom 4467 out of thine hand, 3027 and given 5414-4 it to thy neighbour, 7453 [even] to David: 1732

28:18 Because 834 thou obeyedst 8085-1 not the voice 6963 of the LORD, 3068 nor executedst 6213-1 his fierce 2740 wrath 639 upon Amalek, 6002 therefore hath the LORD 3068 done 6213-1 this thing 1697 unto thee this day. 3117

28:19 Moreover the LORD 3068 will also deliver 5414-4 Israel 3478 with thee into the hand 3027 of the Philistines: 6430 and to morrow 4279 [shalt] thou and thy sons 1121 [be] with me: the LORD 3068 also shall deliver 5414-4 the host 4264 of Israel 3478 into the hand 3027 of the Philistines. 6430

28:20 Then Saul 7586 fell 5307-4 straightway 4116-17 all 4393 along 6967 on the earth, 776 and was sore 3966 afraid, 3372-4 because of the words 1697 of Samuel: 8050 and there was no strength 3581 in him; for he had eaten 398-1 no bread 3899 all the day, 3117 nor all the night. 3915

28:21 And the woman 802 came 935-4 unto Saul, 7586 and saw 7200-4 that he was sore 3966 troubled, 926-8 and said 559-4 unto him, Behold, thine handmaid 8198 hath obeyed 8085-1 thy voice, 6963 and I have put 7760-4 my life 5315 in my hand, 3709 and have hearkened 8085-4 unto thy words 1697 which thou spakest 1696-14 unto me.

28:22 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken 8085-3 thou also unto the voice 6963 of thine handmaid, 8198 and let me set 7760-4 a morsel 6595 of bread 3899 before 6440 thee; and eat, 398-3 that thou mayest have strength, 3581 when thou goest 3212-4 on thy way. 1870

28:23 But he refused, 3985-17 and said, 559-4 I will not eat. 398-4 But his servants, 5650 together with the woman, 802 compelled 6555-4 him; and he hearkened 8085-4 unto their voice. 6963 So he arose 6965-4 from the earth, 776 and sat 3427-4 upon the bed. 4296

28:24 And the woman 802 had a fat 4770 calf 5695 in the house; 1004 and she hasted, 4116-17 and killed 2076-4 it, and took 3947-4 flour, 7058 and kneaded 3888-4 [it], and did bake 644-4 unleavened bread 4682 thereof:

28:25 And she brought 5066-55 [it] before 6440 Saul, 7586 and before 6440 his servants; 5650 and they did eat. 398-4 Then they rose up, 6965-4 and went away 3212-4 that night. 3915

29:1 Now the Philistines 6430 gathered together 6908-4 all their armies 4264 to Aphek: 663 and the Israelites 3478 pitched 2583-6 by a fountain 5869 which [is] in Jezreel. 3157

29:2 And the lords 5633 of the Philistines 6430 passed on 5674-6 by hundreds, 3967 and by thousands: 505 but David 1732 and his men 582 passed on 5674-6 in the rereward 314 with Achish. 397

29:3 Then said 559-4 the princes 8269 of the Philistines, 6430 What [do] these Hebrews 5680 [here]? And Achish 397 said 559-4 unto the princes 8269 of the Philistines, 6430 [Is] not this David, 1732 the servant 5650 of Saul 7586 the king 4428 of Israel, 3478 which hath been with me these days, 3117 or these years, 8141 and I have found 4672-1 no fault 3972 in him since 3117 he fell 5307-2 [unto me] unto this day? 3117

29:4 And the princes 8269 of the Philistines 6430 were wroth 7107-4 with him; and the princes 8269 of the Philistines 6430 said 559-4 unto him, Make this fellow 376 return, 7725-54 that he may go again 7725-4 to his place 4725 which thou hast appointed 6485-52 him, and let him not go down 3381-4 with us to battle, 4421 lest in the battle 4421 he be an adversary 7854 to us: for wherewith should he reconcile 7521-101 himself unto his master? 113 [should it] not [be] with the heads 7218 of these men? 582

29:5 [Is] not this David, 1732 of whom they sang 6030-4 one to another in dances, 4246 saying, 559-2 Saul 7586 slew 5221-52 his thousands, 505 and David 1732 his ten thousands? 7233

29:6 Then Achish 397 called 7121-4 David, 1732 and said 559-4 unto him, Surely, [as] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 thou hast been upright, 3477 and thy going out 3318-2 and thy coming in 935-2 with me in the host 4264 [is] good 2896 in my sight: 5869 for I have not found 4672-1 evil 7451 in thee since the day 3117 of thy coming 935-2 unto me unto this day: 3117 nevertheless the lords 5633 favour 2896 thee not. 5869

29:7 Wherefore now return, 7725-3 and go 3212-3 in peace, 7965 that thou displease 6213-4 7451 5869 not the lords 5633 of the Philistines. 6430

29:8 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto Achish, 397 But what have I done? 6213-1 and what hast thou found 4672-1 in thy servant 5650 so long as 3117 I have been with 6440 thee unto this day, 3117 that I may not go 935-4 fight 3898-8 against the enemies 341-6 of my lord 113 the king? 4428

29:9 And Achish 397 answered 6030-4 and said 559-4 to David, 1732 I know 3045-1 that thou [art] good 2896 in my sight, 5869 as an angel 4397 of God: 430 notwithstanding the princes 8269 of the Philistines 6430 have said, 559-1 He shall not go up 5927-4 with us to the battle. 4421

29:10 Wherefore now rise up early 7925-54 in the morning 1242 with thy master's 113 servants 5650 that are come 935-1 with thee: and as soon as ye be up early 7925-52 in the morning, 1242 and have light, 215-1 depart. 3212-3

29:11 So David 1732 and his men 582 rose up early 7925-55 to depart 3212-2 in the morning, 1242 to return 7725-2 into the land 776 of the Philistines. 6430 And the Philistines 6430 went up 5927-1 to Jezreel. 3157

30:1 And it came to pass, when David 1732 and his men 582 were come 935-2 to Ziklag 6860 on the third 7992 day, 3117 that the Amalekites 6003 had invaded 6584-1 the south, 5045 and Ziklag, 6860 and smitten 5221-55 Ziklag, 6860 and burned 8313-4 it with fire; 784

30:2 And had taken the women 802 captives, 7617-4 that [were] therein: they slew 4191-52 not any, 376 either great 1419 or small, 6996 but carried [them] away, 5090-4 and went 3212-4 on their way. 1870

30:3 So David 1732 and his men 582 came 935-4 to the city, 5892 and, behold, [it was] burned 8313-7 with fire; 784 and their wives, 802 and their sons, 1121 and their daughters, 1323 were taken captives. 7617-8

30:4 Then David 1732 and the people 5971 that [were] with him lifted up 5375-4 their voice 6963 and wept, 1058-4 until they had no more power 3581 to weep. 1058-2

30:5 And David's 1732 two 8147 wives 802 were taken captives, 7617-8 Ahinoam 293 the Jezreelitess, 3159 and Abigail 26 the wife 802 of Nabal 5037 the Carmelite. 3761

30:6 And David 1732 was greatly 3966 distressed; 3334-4 for the people 5971 spake 559-1 of stoning 5619-2 him, because the soul 5315 of all the people 5971 was grieved, 4843-1 every man 376 for his sons 1121 and for his daughters: 1323 but David 1732 encouraged 2388-101 himself in the LORD 3068 his God. 430

30:7 And David 1732 said 559-4 to Abiathar 54 the priest, 3548 Ahimelech's 288 son, 1121 I pray thee, bring me hither 5066-54 the ephod. 646 And Abiathar 54 brought 5066-55 thither the ephod 646 to David. 1732

30:8 And David 1732 enquired 7592-4 at the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 Shall I pursue 7291-4 after 310 this troop? 1416 shall I overtake 5381-55 them? And he answered 559-4 him, Pursue: 7291-3 for thou shalt surely 5381-53 overtake 5381-55 [them], and without fail 5337-53 recover 5337-55 [all].

30:9 So David 1732 went, 3212-4 he and the six 8337 hundred 3967 men 376 that [were] with him, and came 935-4 to the brook 5158 Besor, 1308 where those that were left behind 3498-12 stayed. 5975-1

30:10 But David 1732 pursued, 7291-4 he and four 702 hundred 3967 men: 376 for two hundred 3967 376 abode behind, 5975-4 which were so faint 6296-14 that they could not go over 5674-2 the brook 5158 Besor. 1308

30:11 And they found 4672-4 an Egyptian 376 4713 in the field, 7704 and brought 3947-4 him to David, 1732 and gave 5414-4 him bread, 3899 and he did eat; 398-4 and they made him drink 8248-55 water; 4325

30:12 And they gave 5414-4 him a piece 6400 of a cake 1690 of figs, and two 8147 clusters of raisins: 6778 and when he had eaten, 398-4 his spirit 7307 came again 7725-4 to him: for he had eaten 398-1 no bread, 3899 nor drunk 8354-1 [any] water, 4325 three 7969 days 3117 and three 7969 nights. 3915

30:13 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto him, To whom [belongest] thou? and whence [art] thou? And he said, 559-4 I [am] a young man 5288 of Egypt, 4713 servant 5650 to an Amalekite; 376 6003 and my master 113 left 5800-4 me, because three 7969 days 3117 agone I fell sick. 2470-1

30:14 We made an invasion 6584-1 [upon] the south 5045 of the Cherethites, 3774 and upon [the coast] which [belongeth] to Judah, 3063 and upon the south 5045 of Caleb; 3612 and we burned 8313-1 Ziklag 6860 with fire. 784

30:15 And David 1732 said 559-4 to him, Canst thou bring me down 3381-55 to this company? 1416 And he said, 559-4 Swear 7650-10 unto me by God, 430 that thou wilt neither 518 kill 4191-55 me, nor 518 deliver 5462-55 me into the hands 3027 of my master, 113 and I will bring thee down 3381-55 to this company. 1416

30:16 And when he had brought him down, 3381-55 behold, [they were] spread abroad 5203-7 upon 6440 all the earth, 776 eating 398-6 and drinking, 8354-6 and dancing, 2287-6 because of all the great 1419 spoil 7998 that they had taken 3947-1 out of the land 776 of the Philistines, 6430 and out of the land 776 of Judah. 3063

30:17 And David 1732 smote 5221-55 them from the twilight 5399 even unto the evening 6153 of the next day: 4283 and there escaped 4422-8 not a man 376 of them, save four 702 hundred 3967 young 5288 men, 376 which rode 7392-1 upon camels, 1581 and fled. 5127-4

30:18 And David 1732 recovered 5337-55 all that the Amalekites 6002 had carried away: 3947-1 and David 1732 rescued 5337-52 his two 8147 wives. 802

30:19 And there was nothing lacking 5737-8 to them, neither 4480 small 6996 nor great, 1419 neither sons 1121 nor daughters, 1323 neither spoil, 7998 nor any [thing] that they had taken 3947-1 to them: David 1732 recovered 7725-52 all.

30:20 And David 1732 took 3947-4 all the flocks 6629 and the herds, 1241 [which] they drave 5090-1 before 6440 those 1931 [other] cattle, 4735 and said, 559-4 This [is] David's 1732 spoil. 7998

30:21 And David 1732 came 935-4 to the two hundred 3967 men, 582 which were so faint 6296-14 that they could not follow 3212-2 310 David, 1732 whom they had made also to abide 3427-55 at the brook 5158 Besor: 1308 and they went forth 3318-4 to meet 7125-2 David, 1732 and to meet 7125-2 the people 5971 that [were] with him: and when David 1732 came near 5066-4 to the people, 5971 he saluted 7592-4 7965 them.

30:22 Then answered 6030-4 all the wicked 7451 men 376 and [men] of Belial, 1100 of those 582 that went 1980-1 with David, 1732 and said, 559-4 Because they went 1980-1 not with us, we will not give 5414-4 them [ought] of the spoil 7998 that we have recovered, 5337-52 save to every man 376 his wife 802 and his children, 1121 that they may lead [them] away, 5090-4 and depart. 3212-4

30:23 Then said 559-4 David, 1732 Ye shall not do 6213-4 so, my brethren, 251 with that which the LORD 3068 hath given 5414-1 us, who hath preserved 8104-4 us, and delivered 5414-4 the company 1416 that came 935-6 against us into our hand. 3027

30:24 For who will hearken 8085-4 unto you in this matter? 1697 but as his part 2506 [is] that goeth down 3381-6|3381-90-k to the battle, 4421 so [shall] his part 2506 [be] that tarrieth 3427-6 by the stuff: 3627 they shall part 2505-4 alike. 3162

30:25 And it was [so] from that day 3117 forward, 4605 that he made 7760-4 it a statute 2706 and an ordinance 4941 for Israel 3478 unto this day. 3117

30:26 And when David 1732 came 935-4 to Ziklag, 6860 he sent 7971-17 of the spoil 7998 unto the elders 2205 of Judah, 3063 [even] to his friends, 7453 saying, 559-2 Behold a present 1293 for you of the spoil 7998 of the enemies 341-6 of the LORD; 3068

30:27 To [them] which 834 [were] in Bethel, 1008 and to [them] which [were] in south 5045 Ramoth, 7418 and to [them] which [were] in Jattir, 3492

30:28 And to [them] which [were] in Aroer, 6177 and to [them] which [were] in Siphmoth, 8224 and to [them] which [were] in Eshtemoa, 851

30:29 And to [them] which [were] in Rachal, 7403 and to [them] which [were] in the cities 5892 of the Jerahmeelites, 3397 and to [them] which [were] in the cities 5892 of the Kenites, 7017

30:30 And to [them] which [were] in Hormah, 2767 and to [them] which [were] in Chorashan, 3565 and to [them] which [were] in Athach, 6269

30:31 And to [them] which [were] in Hebron, 2275 and to all the places 4725 where David 1732 himself and his men 582 were wont to haunt. 1980-98

31:1 Now the Philistines 6430 fought 3898-12 against Israel: 3478 and the men 582 of Israel 3478 fled 5127-4 from before 6440 the Philistines, 6430 and fell down 5307-4 slain 2491 in mount 2022 Gilboa. 1533

31:2 And the Philistines 6430 followed hard 1692-55 upon Saul 7586 and upon his sons; 1121 and the Philistines 6430 slew 5221-55 Jonathan, 3083 and Abinadab, 41 and Malchishua, 4444 Saul's 7586 sons. 1121

31:3 And the battle 4421 went sore 3513-4 against Saul, 7586 and the archers 3384-56 582 7198 hit 4672-4 him; and he was sore 3966 wounded 2342-4 of the archers. 3384-56

31:4 Then said 559-4 Saul 7586 unto his armourbearer, 5375-6 3627 Draw 8025-3 thy sword, 2719 and thrust me through 1856-3 therewith; lest these uncircumcised 6189 come 935-4 and thrust me through, 1856-1 and abuse 5953-98 me. But his armourbearer 5375-6 3627 would 14-1 not; for he was sore 3966 afraid. 3372-1 Therefore Saul 7586 took 3947-4 a sword, 2719 and fell 5307-4 upon it.

31:5 And when his armourbearer 5375-6 3627 saw 7200-4 that Saul 7586 was dead, 4191-1 he fell 5307-4 likewise upon his sword, 2719 and died 4191-4 with him.

31:6 So Saul 7586 died, 4191-4 and his three 7969 sons, 1121 and his armourbearer, 5375-6 3627 and all his men, 582 that same day 3117 together. 3162

31:7 And when the men 582 of Israel 3478 that [were] on the other side 5676 of the valley, 6010 and [they] that [were] on the other side 5676 Jordan, 3383 saw 7200-4 that the men 582 of Israel 3478 fled, 5127-1 and that Saul 7586 and his sons 1121 were dead, 4191-1 they forsook 5800-4 the cities, 5892 and fled; 5127-4 and the Philistines 6430 came 935-4 and dwelt 3427-4 in them.

31:8 And it came to pass on the morrow, 4283 when the Philistines 6430 came 935-4 to strip 6584-15 the slain, 2491 that they found 4672-4 Saul 7586 and his three 7969 sons 1121 fallen 5307-6 in mount 2022 Gilboa. 1533

31:9 And they cut off 3772-4 his head, 7218 and stripped off 6584-55 his armour, 3627 and sent 7971-17 into the land 776 of the Philistines 6430 round about, 5439 to publish 1319-15 [it in] the house 1004 of their idols, 6091 and among the people. 5971

31:10 And they put 7760-4 his armour 3627 in the house of Ashtaroth: 1004|6252|1045 and they fastened 8628-1 his body 1472 to the wall 2346 of Bethshan. 1052

31:11 And when the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jabeshgilead 3003 1568 heard 8085-4 of that which the Philistines 6430 had done 6213-1 to Saul; 7586

31:12 All the valiant 2428 men 376 arose, 6965-4 and went 3212-4 all night, 3915 and took 3947-4 the body 1472 of Saul 7586 and the bodies 1472 of his sons 1121 from the wall 2346 of Bethshan, 1052 and came 935-4 to Jabesh, 3003 and burnt 8313-4 them there.

31:13 And they took 3947-4 their bones, 6106 and buried 6912-4 [them] under a tree 815 at Jabesh, 3003 and fasted 6684-4 seven 7651 days. 3117
