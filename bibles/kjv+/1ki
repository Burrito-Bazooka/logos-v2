1:1 Now king 4428 David 1732 was old 2204-1 [and] stricken 935-1 in years; 3117 and they covered 3680-17 him with clothes, 899 but he gat no heat. 3179-4

1:2 Wherefore his servants 5650 said 559-4 unto him, Let there be sought 1245-17 for my lord 113 the king 4428 a young 5291 virgin: 1330 and let her stand 5975-1 before 6440 the king, 4428 and let her cherish 5532-6 him, and let her lie 7901-1 in thy bosom, 2436 that my lord 113 the king 4428 may get heat. 2552-1

1:3 So they sought 1245-17 for a fair 3303 damsel 5291 throughout all the coasts 1366 of Israel, 3478 and found 4672-4 Abishag 49 a Shunammite, 7767 and brought 935-55 her to the king. 4428

1:4 And the damsel 5291 [was] very 3966 fair, 3303 and cherished 5532-6 the king, 4428 and ministered 8334-17 to him: but the king 4428 knew 3045-1 her not.

1:5 Then Adonijah 138 the son 1121 of Haggith 2294 exalted 4984-102|5375-102 himself, saying, 559-2 I will be king: 4427-4 and he prepared 6213-4 him chariots 7393 and horsemen, 6571 and fifty 2572 men 376 to run 7323-5 before 6440 him.

1:6 And his father 1 had not displeased 6087-1 him at any time 3117 in saying, 559-2 Why hast thou done 6213-1 so? and he also [was a] very 3966 goodly 2896 8389 [man]; and [his mother] bare 3205-1 him after 310 Absalom. 53

1:7 And he conferred 1697 with Joab 3097 the son 1121 of Zeruiah, 6870 and with Abiathar 54 the priest: 3548 and they following 310 Adonijah 138 helped 5826-4 [him].

1:8 But Zadok 6659 the priest, 3548 and Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada, 3077 and Nathan 5416 the prophet, 5030 and Shimei, 8096 and Rei, 7472 and the mighty men 1368 which [belonged] to David, 1732 were not with Adonijah. 138

1:9 And Adonijah 138 slew 2076-4 sheep 6629 and oxen 1241 and fat cattle 4806 by the stone 68 of Zoheleth, 2120 which [is] by 681 Enrogel, 5883 and called 7121-4 all his brethren 251 the king's 4428 sons, 1121 and all the men 582 of Judah 3063 the king's 4428 servants: 5650

1:10 But Nathan 5416 the prophet, 5030 and Benaiah, 1141 and the mighty men, 1368 and Solomon 8010 his brother, 251 he called 7121-1 not.

1:11 Wherefore Nathan 5416 spake 559-4 unto Bathsheba 1339 the mother 517 of Solomon, 8010 saying, 559-2 Hast thou not heard 8085-1 that Adonijah 138 the son 1121 of Haggith 2294 doth reign, 4427-1 and David 1732 our lord 113 knoweth 3045-1 [it] not?

1:12 Now therefore come, 3212-3 let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, 3289-4 6098 that thou mayest save 4422-16 thine own life, 5315 and the life 5315 of thy son 1121 Solomon. 8010

1:13 Go 3212-3 and get thee in 935-3 unto king 4428 David, 1732 and say 559-1 unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, 113 O king, 4428 swear 7650-8 unto thine handmaid, 519 saying, 559-2 Assuredly 3588 Solomon 8010 thy son 1121 shall reign 4427-4 after 310 me, and he shall sit 3427-4 upon my throne? 3678 why then doth Adonijah 138 reign? 4427-1

1:14 Behold, while thou yet talkest 1696-18 there with the king, 4428 I also will come in 935-4 after 310 thee, and confirm 4390-14 thy words. 1697

1:15 And Bathsheba 1339 went in 935-4 unto the king 4428 into the chamber: 2315 and the king 4428 was very 3966 old; 2204-1 and Abishag 49 the Shunammite 7767 ministered 8334-18 unto the king. 4428

1:16 And Bathsheba 1339 bowed, 6915-4 and did obeisance 7812-101 unto the king. 4428 And the king 4428 said, 559-4 What wouldest thou?

1:17 And she said 559-4 unto him, My lord, 113 thou swarest 7650-8 by the LORD 3068 thy God 430 unto thine handmaid, 519 [saying], Assuredly Solomon 8010 thy son 1121 shall reign 4427-4 after 310 me, and he shall sit 3427-4 upon my throne. 3678

1:18 And now, behold, Adonijah 138 reigneth; 4427-1 and now, my lord 113 the king, 4428 thou knowest 3045-1 [it] not:

1:19 And he hath slain 2076-4 oxen 7794 and fat cattle 4806 and sheep 6629 in abundance, 7230 and hath called 7121-4 all the sons 1121 of the king, 4428 and Abiathar 54 the priest, 3548 and Joab 3097 the captain 8269 of the host: 6635 but Solomon 8010 thy servant 5650 hath he not called. 7121-1

1:20 And thou, my lord, 113 O king, 4428 the eyes 5869 of all Israel 3478 [are] upon thee, that thou shouldest tell 5046-53 them who shall sit 3427-4 on the throne 3678 of my lord 113 the king 4428 after 310 him.

1:21 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord 113 the king 4428 shall sleep 7901-2 with his fathers, 1 that I and my son 1121 Solomon 8010 shall be counted offenders. 2400

1:22 And, lo, while she yet talked 1696-18 with the king, 4428 Nathan 5416 the prophet 5030 also came in. 935-1

1:23 And they told 5046-55 the king, 4428 saying, 559-2 Behold Nathan 5416 the prophet. 5030 And when he was come in 935-4 before 6440 the king, 4428 he bowed 7812-101 himself before the king 4428 with his face 639 to the ground. 776

1:24 And Nathan 5416 said, 559-4 My lord, 113 O king, 4428 hast thou said, 559-1 Adonijah 138 shall reign 4427-4 after 310 me, and he shall sit 3427-4 upon my throne? 3678

1:25 For he is gone down 3381-1 this day, 3117 and hath slain 2076-4 oxen 7794 and fat cattle 4806 and sheep 6629 in abundance, 7230 and hath called 7121-4 all the king's 4428 sons, 1121 and the captains 8269 of the host, 6635 and Abiathar 54 the priest; 3548 and, behold, they eat 398-6 and drink 8354-6 before 6440 him, and say, 559-4 God save 2421-4 king 4428 Adonijah. 138

1:26 But me, [even] me thy servant, 5650 and Zadok 6659 the priest, 3548 and Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada, 3077 and thy servant 5650 Solomon, 8010 hath he not called. 7121-1

1:27 Is this thing 1697 done 1961-8 by my lord 113 the king, 4428 and thou hast not shewed 3045-52 [it] unto thy servant, 5650 who should sit 3427-4 on the throne 3678 of my lord 113 the king 4428 after 310 him?

1:28 Then king 4428 David 1732 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 Call 7121-3 me Bathsheba. 1339 And she came 935-4 into the king's 4428 presence, 6440 and stood 5975-4 before 6440 the king. 4428

1:29 And the king 4428 sware, 7650-11 and said, 559-4 [As] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 that hath redeemed 6299-1 my soul 5315 out of all distress, 6869

1:30 Even as I sware 7650-8 unto thee by the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 Assuredly Solomon 8010 thy son 1121 shall reign 4427-4 after 310 me, and he shall sit 3427-4 upon my throne 3678 in my stead; even so will I certainly do 6213-4 this day. 3117

1:31 Then Bathsheba 1339 bowed 6915-4 with [her] face 639 to the earth, 776 and did reverence 7812-101 to the king, 4428 and said, 559-4 Let my lord 113 king 4428 David 1732 live 2421-4 for ever. 5769

1:32 And king 4428 David 1732 said, 559-4 Call 7121-3 me Zadok 6659 the priest, 3548 and Nathan 5416 the prophet, 5030 and Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada. 3077 And they came 935-4 before 6440 the king. 4428

1:33 The king 4428 also said 559-4 unto them, Take 3947-3 with you the servants 5650 of your lord, 113 and cause Solomon 8010 my son 1121 to ride 7392-52 upon mine own mule, 6506 and bring him down 3381-52 to Gihon: 1521

1:34 And let Zadok 6659 the priest 3548 and Nathan 5416 the prophet 5030 anoint 4886-1 him there king 4428 over Israel: 3478 and blow 8628-1 ye with the trumpet, 7782 and say, 559-1 God save 2421-4 king 4428 Solomon. 8010

1:35 Then ye shall come up 5927-1 after 310 him, that he may come 935-1 and sit 3427-1 upon my throne; 3678 for he shall be king 4427-4 in my stead: and I have appointed 6680-14 him to be ruler 5057 over Israel 3478 and over Judah. 3063

1:36 And Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada 3077 answered 6030-4 the king, 4428 and said, 559-4 Amen: 543 the LORD 3068 God 430 of my lord 113 the king 4428 say 559-4 so [too].

1:37 As the LORD 3068 hath been with my lord 113 the king, 4428 even so be he with Solomon, 8010 and make his throne 3678 greater 1431-17 than the throne 3678 of my lord 113 king 4428 David. 1732

1:38 So Zadok 6659 the priest, 3548 and Nathan 5416 the prophet, 5030 and Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada, 3077 and the Cherethites, 3774 and the Pelethites, 6432 went down, 3381-4 and caused Solomon 8010 to ride 7392-55 upon king 4428 David's 1732 mule, 6506 and brought 3212-55 him to Gihon. 1521

1:39 And Zadok 6659 the priest 3548 took 3947-4 an horn 7161 of oil 8081 out of the tabernacle, 168 and anointed 4886-4 Solomon. 8010 And they blew 8628-4 the trumpet; 7782 and all the people 5971 said, 559-4 God save 2421-4 king 4428 Solomon. 8010

1:40 And all the people 5971 came up 5927-4 after 310 him, and the people 5971 piped 2490-18 with pipes, 2485 and rejoiced 8056 with great 1419 joy, 8057 so that the earth 776 rent 1234-11 with the sound 6963 of them.

1:41 And Adonijah 138 and all the guests 7121-7 that [were] with him heard 8085-4 [it] as they had made an end 3615-14 of eating. 398-2 And when Joab 3097 heard 8085-4 the sound 6963 of the trumpet, 7782 he said, 559-4 Wherefore [is this] noise 6963 of the city 7151 being in an uproar? 1993-6

1:42 And while he yet spake, 1696-18 behold, Jonathan 3129 the son 1121 of Abiathar 54 the priest 3548 came: 935-1 and Adonijah 138 said 559-4 unto him, Come in; 935-3 for thou [art] a valiant 2428 man, 376 and bringest good 2896 tidings. 1319-17

1:43 And Jonathan 3129 answered 6030-4 and said 559-4 to Adonijah, 138 Verily 61 our lord 113 king 4428 David 1732 hath made Solomon 8010 king. 4427-52

1:44 And the king 4428 hath sent 7971-4 with him Zadok 6659 the priest, 3548 and Nathan 5416 the prophet, 5030 and Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada, 3077 and the Cherethites, 3774 and the Pelethites, 6432 and they have caused him to ride 7392-55 upon the king's 4428 mule: 6506

1:45 And Zadok 6659 the priest 3548 and Nathan 5416 the prophet 5030 have anointed 4886-4 him king 4428 in Gihon: 1521 and they are come up 5927-4 from thence rejoicing, 8056 so that the city 7151 rang again. 1949-11 This [is] the noise 6963 that ye have heard. 8085-1

1:46 And also Solomon 8010 sitteth 3427-1 on the throne 3678 of the kingdom. 4410

1:47 And moreover the king's 4428 servants 5650 came 935-1 to bless 1288-15 our lord 113 king 4428 David, 1732 saying, 559-2 God 430 make the name 8034 of Solomon 8010 better 3190-55 than thy name, 8034 and make his throne 3678 greater 1431-17 than thy throne. 3678 And the king 4428 bowed 7812-101 himself upon the bed. 4904

1:48 And also thus said 559-1 the king, 4428 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 which hath given 5414-1 [one] to sit 3427-6 on my throne 3678 this day, 3117 mine eyes 5869 even seeing 7200-6 [it].

1:49 And all the guests 7121-7 that [were] with Adonijah 138 were afraid, 2729-4 and rose up, 6965-4 and went 3212-4 every man 376 his way. 1870

1:50 And Adonijah 138 feared 3372-1 because 6440 of Solomon, 8010 and arose, 6965-4 and went, 3212-4 and caught hold 2388-55 on the horns 7161 of the altar. 4196

1:51 And it was told 5046-93 Solomon, 8010 saying, 559-2 Behold, Adonijah 138 feareth 3372-1 king 4428 Solomon: 8010 for, lo, he hath caught hold 270-1 on the horns 7161 of the altar, 4196 saying, 559-2 Let king 4428 Solomon 8010 swear 7650-11 unto me to day 3117 that he will not slay 4191-55 his servant 5650 with the sword. 2719

1:52 And Solomon 8010 said, 559-4 If he will shew himself a worthy 2428 man, 1121 there shall not an hair 8185 of him fall 5307-4 to the earth: 776 but if wickedness 7451 shall be found 4672-11 in him, he shall die. 4191-1

1:53 So king 4428 Solomon 8010 sent, 7971-4 and they brought him down 3381-55 from the altar. 4196 And he came 935-4 and bowed 7812-101 himself to king 4428 Solomon: 8010 and Solomon 8010 said 559-4 unto him, Go 3212-3 to thine house. 1004

2:1 Now the days 3117 of David 1732 drew nigh 7126-4 that he should die; 4191-2 and he charged 6680-17 Solomon 8010 his son, 1121 saying, 559-2

2:2 I go 1980-6 the way 1870 of all the earth: 776 be thou strong 2388-1 therefore, and shew thyself a man; 376

2:3 And keep 8104-1 the charge 4931 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 to walk 3212-2 in his ways, 1870 to keep 8104-2 his statutes, 2708 and his commandments, 4687 and his judgments, 4941 and his testimonies, 5715 as it is written 3789-7 in the law 8451 of Moses, 4872 that thou mayest prosper 7919-55 in all that thou doest, 6213-4 and whithersoever thou turnest 6437-4 thyself:

2:4 That the LORD 3068 may continue 6965-55 his word 1697 which he spake 1696-14 concerning me, saying, 559-2 If thy children 1121 take heed 8104-4 to their way, 1870 to walk 3212-2 before 6440 me in truth 571 with all their heart 3824 and with all their soul, 5315 there shall not fail 3772-11 thee (said 559-2 he) a man 376 on the throne 3678 of Israel. 3478

2:5 Moreover thou knowest 3045-1 also what Joab 3097 the son 1121 of Zeruiah 6870 did 6213-1 to me, [and] what he did 6213-1 to the two 8147 captains 8269 of the hosts 6635 of Israel, 3478 unto Abner 74 the son 1121 of Ner, 5369 and unto Amasa 6021 the son 1121 of Jether, 3500 whom he slew, 2026-4 and shed 7760-4 the blood 1818 of war 4421 in peace, 7965 and put 5414-4 the blood 1818 of war 4421 upon his girdle 2290 that [was] about his loins, 4975 and in his shoes 5275 that [were] on his feet. 7272

2:6 Do 6213-1 therefore according to thy wisdom, 2451 and let not his hoar head 7872 go down 3381-55 to the grave 7585 in peace. 7965

2:7 But shew 6213-4 kindness 2617 unto the sons 1121 of Barzillai 1271 the Gileadite, 1569 and let them be of those that eat 398-6 at thy table: 7979 for so they came 7126-1 to me when I fled 1272-2 because 6440 of Absalom 53 thy brother. 251

2:8 And, behold, [thou hast] with thee Shimei 8096 the son 1121 of Gera, 1617 a Benjamite 1145 of Bahurim, 980 which cursed 7043-14 me with a grievous 4834-12 curse 7045 in the day 3117 when I went 3212-2 to Mahanaim: 4266 but he came down 3381-1 to meet 7125-2 me at Jordan, 3383 and I sware 7650-11 to him by the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 I will not put thee to death 4191-55 with the sword. 2719

2:9 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: 5352-17 for thou [art] a wise 2450 man, 376 and knowest 3045-1 what thou oughtest to do 6213-4 unto him; but his hoar head 7872 bring thou down 3381-52 to the grave 7585 with blood. 1818

2:10 So David 1732 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and was buried 6912-11 in the city 5892 of David. 1732

2:11 And the days 3117 that David 1732 reigned 4427-1 over Israel 3478 [were] forty 705 years: 8141 seven 7651 years 8141 reigned 4427-1 he in Hebron, 2275 and thirty 7970 and three 7969 years 8141 reigned 4427-1 he in Jerusalem. 3389

2:12 Then sat 3427-1 Solomon 8010 upon the throne 3678 of David 1732 his father; 1 and his kingdom 4438 was established 3559-11 greatly. 3966

2:13 And Adonijah 138 the son 1121 of Haggith 2294 came 935-4 to Bathsheba 1339 the mother 517 of Solomon. 8010 And she said, 559-4 Comest 935-2 thou peaceably? 7965 And he said, 559-4 Peaceably. 7965

2:14 He said 559-4 moreover, I have somewhat to say 1697 unto thee. And she said, 559-4 Say on. 1696-16

2:15 And he said, 559-4 Thou knowest 3045-1 that the kingdom 4410 was mine, and [that] all Israel 3478 set 7760-1 their faces 6440 on me, that I should reign: 4427-2 howbeit the kingdom 4410 is turned about, 5437-11 and is become my brother's: 251 for it was his from the LORD. 3068

2:16 And now I ask 7592-6 one 259 petition 7596 of thee, deny 7725-55 me 6440 not. And she said 559-4 unto him, Say on. 1696-16

2:17 And he said, 559-4 Speak, 559-3 I pray thee, unto Solomon 8010 the king, 4428 (for he will not say thee 6440 nay,) 7725-55 that he give 5414-4 me Abishag 49 the Shunammite 7767 to wife. 802

2:18 And Bathsheba 1339 said, 559-4 Well; 2896 I will speak 1696-17 for thee unto the king. 4428

2:19 Bathsheba 1339 therefore went 935-4 unto king 4428 Solomon, 8010 to speak 1696-15 unto him for Adonijah. 138 And the king 4428 rose up 6965-4 to meet 7125-2 her, and bowed 7812-101 himself unto her, and sat down 3427-4 on his throne, 3678 and caused a seat 3678 to be set 7760-4 for the king's 4428 mother; 517 and she sat 3427-4 on his right hand. 3225

2:20 Then she said, 559-4 I desire 7592-6 one 259 small 6996 petition 7596 of thee; [I pray thee], say me 6440 not nay. 7725-55 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto her, Ask on, 7592-3 my mother: 517 for I will not say thee 6440 nay. 7725-55

2:21 And she said, 559-4 Let Abishag 49 the Shunammite 7767 be given 5414-93 to Adonijah 138 thy brother 251 to wife. 802

2:22 And king 4428 Solomon 8010 answered 6030-4 and said 559-4 unto his mother, 517 And why dost thou ask 7592-6 Abishag 49 the Shunammite 7767 for Adonijah? 138 ask 7592-3 for him the kingdom 4410 also; for he [is] mine elder 1419 brother; 251 even for him, and for Abiathar 54 the priest, 3548 and for Joab 3097 the son 1121 of Zeruiah. 6870

2:23 Then king 4428 Solomon 8010 sware 7650-11 by the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 God 430 do 6213-4 so to me, and more 3254-55 also, if Adonijah 138 have not spoken 1696-14 this word 1697 against his own life. 5315

2:24 Now therefore, [as] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 which hath established 3559-52 me, and set 3427-55 me on the throne 3678 of David 1732 my father, 1 and who hath made 6213-1 me an house, 1004 as he promised, 1696-14 Adonijah 138 shall be put to death 4191-93 this day. 3117

2:25 And king 4428 Solomon 8010 sent 7971-4 by the hand 3027 of Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada; 3077 and he fell 6293-4 upon him that he died. 4191-4

2:26 And unto Abiathar 54 the priest 3548 said 559-1 the king, 4428 Get 3212-3 thee to Anathoth, 6068 unto thine own fields; 7704 for thou [art] worthy 376 of death: 4194 but I will not at this time 3117 put thee to death, 4191-55 because thou barest 5375-1 the ark 727 of the Lord 136 GOD 3069 before 6440 David 1732 my father, 1 and because thou hast been afflicted 6031-98 in all wherein my father 1 was afflicted. 6031-98

2:27 So Solomon 8010 thrust out 1644-17 Abiathar 54 from being priest 3548 unto the LORD; 3068 that he might fulfil 4390-15 the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 which he spake 1696-14 concerning the house 1004 of Eli 5941 in Shiloh. 7887

2:28 Then tidings 8052 came 935-1 to Joab: 3097 for Joab 3097 had turned 5186-1 after 310 Adonijah, 138 though he turned 5186-1 not after 310 Absalom. 53 And Joab 3097 fled 5127-4 unto the tabernacle 168 of the LORD, 3068 and caught hold 2388-55 on the horns 7161 of the altar. 4196

2:29 And it was told 5046-93 king 4428 Solomon 8010 that Joab 3097 was fled 5127-1 unto the tabernacle 168 of the LORD; 3068 and, behold, [he is] by 681 the altar. 4196 Then Solomon 8010 sent 7971-4 Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada, 3077 saying, 559-2 Go, 3212-3 fall 6293-3 upon him.

2:30 And Benaiah 1141 came 935-4 to the tabernacle 168 of the LORD, 3068 and said 559-4 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 the king, 4428 Come forth. 3318-3 And he said, 559-4 Nay; but I will die 4191-4 here. And Benaiah 1141 brought the king 4428 word 1697 again, 7725-55 saying, 559-2 Thus said 1696-14 Joab, 3097 and thus he answered 6030-1 me.

2:31 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto him, Do 6213-3 as he hath said, 1696-14 and fall 6293-3 upon him, and bury 6912-1 him; that thou mayest take away 5493-52 the innocent 2600 blood, 1818 which Joab 3097 shed, 8210-1 from me, and from the house 1004 of my father. 1

2:32 And the LORD 3068 shall return 7725-52 his blood 1818 upon his own head, 7218 who fell upon 6293-1 two 8147 men 582 more righteous 6662 and better 2896 than he, and slew 2026-4 them with the sword, 2719 my father 1 David 1732 not knowing 3045-1 [thereof, to wit], Abner 74 the son 1121 of Ner, 5369 captain 8269 of the host 6635 of Israel, 3478 and Amasa 6021 the son 1121 of Jether, 3500 captain 8269 of the host 6635 of Judah. 3063

2:33 Their blood 1818 shall therefore return 7725-1 upon the head 7218 of Joab, 3097 and upon the head 7218 of his seed 2233 for ever: 5769 but upon David, 1732 and upon his seed, 2233 and upon his house, 1004 and upon his throne, 3678 shall there be peace 7965 for 5704 ever 5769 from the LORD. 3068

2:34 So Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada 3077 went up, 5927-4 and fell 6293-4 upon him, and slew 4191-55 him: and he was buried 6912-11 in his own house 1004 in the wilderness. 4057

2:35 And the king 4428 put 5414-4 Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada 3077 in his room over the host: 6635 and Zadok 6659 the priest 3548 did the king 4428 put 5414-1 in the room of Abiathar. 54

2:36 And the king 4428 sent 7971-4 and called 7121-4 for Shimei, 8096 and said 559-4 unto him, Build 1129-3 thee an house 1004 in Jerusalem, 3389 and dwell 3427-1 there, and go not forth 3318-4 thence any whither. 575

2:37 For it shall be, [that] on the day 3117 thou goest out, 3318-2 and passest over 5674-1 the brook 5158 Kidron, 6939 thou shalt know 3045-4 for certain 3045-2 that thou shalt surely 4191-2 die: 4191-4 thy blood 1818 shall be upon thine own head. 7218

2:38 And Shimei 8096 said 559-4 unto the king, 4428 The saying 1697 [is] good: 2896 as my lord 113 the king 4428 hath said, 1696-14 so will thy servant 5650 do. 6213-4 And Shimei 8096 dwelt 3427-4 in Jerusalem 3389 many 7227 days. 3117

2:39 And it came to pass at the end 7093 of three 7969 years, 8141 that two 8147 of the servants 5650 of Shimei 8096 ran away 1272-4 unto Achish 397 son 1121 of Maachah 4601 king 4428 of Gath. 1661 And they told 5046-55 Shimei, 8096 saying, 559-2 Behold, thy servants 5650 [be] in Gath. 1661

2:40 And Shimei 8096 arose, 6965-4 and saddled 2280-4 his ass, 2543 and went 3212-4 to Gath 1661 to Achish 397 to seek 1245-15 his servants: 5650 and Shimei 8096 went, 3212-4 and brought 935-55 his servants 5650 from Gath. 1661

2:41 And it was told 5046-93 Solomon 8010 that Shimei 8096 had gone 1980-1 from Jerusalem 3389 to Gath, 1661 and was come again. 7725-4

2:42 And the king 4428 sent 7971-4 and called 7121-4 for Shimei, 8096 and said 559-4 unto him, Did I not make thee to swear 7650-52 by the LORD, 3068 and protested 5749-55 unto thee, saying, 559-2 Know 3045-4 for a certain, 3045-2 on the day 3117 thou goest out, 3318-2 and walkest 1980-1 abroad any whither, 575 that thou shalt surely 4191-2 die? 4191-4 and thou saidst 559-4 unto me, The word 1697 [that] I have heard 8085-1 [is] good. 2896

2:43 Why then hast thou not kept 8104-1 the oath 7621 of the LORD, 3068 and the commandment 4687 that I have charged 6680-14 thee with?

2:44 The king 4428 said 559-4 moreover to Shimei, 8096 Thou knowest 3045-1 all the wickedness 7451 which thine heart 3824 is privy to, 3045-1 that thou didst 6213-1 to David 1732 my father: 1 therefore the LORD 3068 shall return 7725-52 thy wickedness 7451 upon thine own head; 7218

2:45 And king 4428 Solomon 8010 [shall be] blessed, 1288-7 and the throne 3678 of David 1732 shall be established 3559-12 before 6440 the LORD 3068 for 5704 ever. 5769

2:46 So the king 4428 commanded 6680-17 Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada; 3077 which went out, 3318-4 and fell 6293-4 upon him, that he died. 4191-4 And the kingdom 4467 was established 3559-8 in the hand 3027 of Solomon. 8010

3:1 And Solomon 8010 made affinity 2859-101 with Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt, 4714 and took 3947-4 Pharaoh's 6547 daughter, 1323 and brought 935-55 her into the city 5892 of David, 1732 until he had made an end 3615-15 of building 1129-2 his own house, 1004 and the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and the wall 2346 of Jerusalem 3389 round about. 5439

3:2 Only the people 5971 sacrificed 2076-18 in high places, 1116 because there was no house 1004 built 1129-8 unto the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 until those days. 3117

3:3 And Solomon 8010 loved 157-4 the LORD, 3068 walking 3212-2 in the statutes 2708 of David 1732 his father: 1 only he sacrificed 2076-18 and burnt incense 6999-56 in high places. 1116

3:4 And the king 4428 went 3212-4 to Gibeon 1391 to sacrifice 2076-2 there; for that 1931 [was] the great 1419 high place: 1116 a thousand 505 burnt offerings 5930 did Solomon 8010 offer 5927-55 upon that altar. 4196

3:5 In Gibeon 1391 the LORD 3068 appeared 7200-8 to Solomon 8010 in a dream 2472 by night: 3915 and God 430 said, 559-4 Ask 7592-3 what I shall give 5414-4 thee.

3:6 And Solomon 8010 said, 559-4 Thou hast shewed 6213-1 unto thy servant 5650 David 1732 my father 1 great 1419 mercy, 2617 according as he walked 1980-1 before 6440 thee in truth, 571 and in righteousness, 6666 and in uprightness 3483 of heart 3824 with thee; and thou hast kept 8104-4 for him this great 1419 kindness, 2617 that thou hast given 5414-4 him a son 1121 to sit 3427-6 on his throne, 3678 as [it is] this day. 3117

3:7 And now, O LORD 3068 my God, 430 thou hast made thy servant 5650 king 4427-52 instead of David 1732 my father: 1 and I [am but] a little 6996 child: 5288 I know 3045-4 not [how] to go out 3318-2 or come in. 935-2

3:8 And thy servant 5650 [is] in the midst 8432 of thy people 5971 which thou hast chosen, 977-1 a great 7227 people, 5971 that cannot be numbered 4487-11 nor counted 5608-11 for multitude. 7230

3:9 Give 5414-1 therefore thy servant 5650 an understanding 8085-6 heart 3820 to judge 8199-2 thy people, 5971 that I may discern 995-53 between good 2896 and bad: 7451 for who is able 3201-4 to judge 8199-2 this thy so great 3515 a people? 5971

3:10 And the speech 1697 pleased 3190-4 5869 the Lord, 136 that Solomon 8010 had asked 7592-1 this thing. 1697

3:11 And God 430 said 559-4 unto him, Because thou hast asked 7592-1 this thing, 1697 and hast not asked 7592-1 for thyself long 7227 life; 3117 neither hast asked 7592-1 riches 6239 for thyself, nor hast asked 7592-1 the life 5315 of thine enemies; 341-6 but hast asked 7592-1 for thyself understanding 995-53 to discern 8085-2 judgment; 4941

3:12 Behold, I have done 6213-1 according to thy words: 1697 lo, I have given 5414-1 thee a wise 2450 and an understanding 995-12 heart; 3820 so that there was none like thee before 6440 thee, neither after 310 thee shall any arise 6965-4 like unto thee.

3:13 And I have also given 5414-1 thee that which thou hast not asked, 7592-1 both riches, 6239 and honour: 3519 so that there shall not be any 376 among the kings 4428 like unto thee all thy days. 3117

3:14 And if thou wilt walk 3212-4 in my ways, 1870 to keep 8104-2 my statutes 2706 and my commandments, 4687 as thy father 1 David 1732 did walk, 1980-1 then I will lengthen 748-52 thy days. 3117

3:15 And Solomon 8010 awoke; 3364-4 and, behold, [it was] a dream. 2472 And he came 935-4 to Jerusalem, 3389 and stood 5975-4 before 6440 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD, 3068 and offered up 5927-55 burnt offerings, 5930 and offered 6213-4 peace offerings, 8002 and made 6213-4 a feast 4960 to all his servants. 5650

3:16 Then came 935-4 there two 8147 women, 802 [that were] harlots, 2181-6 unto the king, 4428 and stood 5975-4 before 6440 him.

3:17 And the one 259 woman 802 said, 559-4 O 994 my lord, 113 I and this woman 802 dwell 3427-6 in one 259 house; 1004 and I was delivered of a child 3205-4 with her in the house. 1004

3:18 And it came to pass the third 7992 day 3117 after that I was delivered, 3205-2 that this woman 802 was delivered 3205-4 also: and we [were] together; 3162 [there was] no stranger 2114-5 with us in the house, 1004 save 2108 we two 8147 in the house. 1004

3:19 And this woman's 802 child 1121 died 4191-4 in the night; 3915 because she overlaid 7901-1 it.

3:20 And she arose 6965-4 at midnight, 8432 3915 and took 3947-4 my son 1121 from beside 681 me, while thine handmaid 519 slept, 3463 and laid 7901-55 it in her bosom, 2436 and laid 7901-52 her dead 4191-5 child 1121 in my bosom. 2436

3:21 And when I rose 6965-4 in the morning 1242 to give my child 1121 suck, 3243-53 behold, it was dead: 4191-1 but when I had considered 995-113 it in the morning, 1242 behold, it was not my son, 1121 which I did bear. 3205-1

3:22 And the other 312 woman 802 said, 559-4 Nay; but the living 2416 [is] my son, 1121 and the dead 4191-5 [is] thy son. 1121 And this said, 559-6 No; but the dead 4191-5 [is] thy son, 1121 and the living 2416 [is] my son. 1121 Thus they spake 1696-17 before 6440 the king. 4428

3:23 Then said 559-4 the king, 4428 The one 2063 saith, 559-6 This [is] my son 1121 that liveth, 2416 and thy son 1121 [is] the dead: 4191-5 and the other 2063 saith, 559-6 Nay; but thy son 1121 [is] the dead, 4191-5 and my son 1121 [is] the living. 2416

3:24 And the king 4428 said, 559-4 Bring 3947-3 me a sword. 2719 And they brought 935-55 a sword 2719 before 6440 the king. 4428

3:25 And the king 4428 said, 559-4 Divide 1504-3 the living 2416 child 3206 in two, 8147 and give 5414-3 half 2677 to the one, 259 and half 2677 to the other. 259

3:26 Then spake 559-4 the woman 802 whose the living 2416 child 1121 [was] unto the king, 4428 for her bowels 7356 yearned 3648-8 upon her son, 1121 and she said, 559-4 O 994 my lord, 113 give 5414-3 her the living 2416 child, 3205-7 and in no wise 4191-53 slay 4191-55 it. But the other said, 559-6 Let it be neither mine nor thine, [but] divide 1504-3 [it].

3:27 Then the king 4428 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 Give 5414-3 her the living 2416 child, 3205-7 and in no wise 4191-53 slay 4191-55 it: she [is] the mother 517 thereof.

3:28 And all Israel 3478 heard 8085-4 of the judgment 4941 which the king 4428 had judged; 8199-1 and they feared 3372-4 6440 the king: 4228 for they saw 7200-1 that the wisdom 2451 of God 430 [was] in 7130 him, to do 6213-2 judgment. 4941

4:1 So king 4428 Solomon 8010 was king 4428 over all Israel. 3478

4:2 And these [were] the princes 8269 which he had; Azariah 5838 the son 1121 of Zadok 6659 the priest, 3548

4:3 Elihoreph 456 and Ahiah, 281 the sons 1121 of Shisha, 7894 scribes; 5608-6 Jehoshaphat 3092 the son 1121 of Ahilud, 286 the recorder. 2142-56

4:4 And Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada 3077 [was] over the host: 6635 and Zadok 6659 and Abiathar 54 [were] the priests: 3548

4:5 And Azariah 5838 the son 1121 of Nathan 5416 [was] over the officers: 5324-12 and Zabud 2071 the son 1121 of Nathan 5416 [was] principal officer, 3548 [and] the king's 4428 friend: 7463

4:6 And Ahishar 301 [was] over the household: 1004 and Adoniram 141 the son 1121 of Abda 5653 [was] over the tribute. 4522

4:7 And Solomon 8010 had twelve 8147 6240 officers 5324-12 over all Israel, 3478 which provided victuals 3557-43 for the king 4428 and his household: 1004 each man 259 his month 2320 in a year 8141 made provision. 3557-44

4:8 And these [are] their names: 8034 The son of Hur, 1121|2354|1133 in mount 2022 Ephraim: 669

4:9 The son 1121 of Dekar, 1857 in Makaz, 4739 and in Shaalbim, 8169 and Bethshemesh, 1053 and Elonbethhanan: 358

4:11 The son 1121 of Abinadab, 41 in all the region 5299 of Dor; 1756 which had Taphath 2955 the daughter 1323 of Solomon 8010 to wife: 802

4:12 Baana 1195 the son 1121 of Ahilud; 286 [to him pertained] Taanach 8590 and Megiddo, 4023 and all Bethshean, 1052 which [is] by 681 Zartanah 6891 beneath Jezreel, 3157 from Bethshean 1052 to Abelmeholah, 65 [even] unto [the place that is] beyond 5676 Jokneam: 3361

4:13 The son of Geber, 1127 in Ramothgilead; 1568 7433 to him [pertained] the towns 2333 of Jair 2971 the son 1121 of Manasseh, 4519 which [are] in Gilead; 1568 to him [also pertained] the region 2256 of Argob, 709 which [is] in Bashan, 1316 threescore 8346 great 1419 cities 5892 with walls 2346 and brasen 5178 bars: 1280

4:14 Ahinadab 292 the son 1121 of Iddo 5714 [had] Mahanaim: 4266

4:15 Ahimaaz 290 [was] in Naphtali; 5321 he also took 3947-1 Basmath 1315 the daughter 1323 of Solomon 8010 to wife: 802

4:16 Baanah 1195 the son 1121 of Hushai 2365 [was] in Asher 836 and in Aloth: 1175

4:19 Geber 1398 the son 1121 of Uri 221 [was] in the country 776 of Gilead, 1568 [in] the country 776 of Sihon 5511 king 4428 of the Amorites, 567 and of Og 5747 king 4428 of Bashan; 1316 and [he was] the only 259 officer 5333 which [was] in the land. 776

4:20 Judah 3063 and Israel 3478 [were] many, 7227 as the sand 2344 which [is] by the sea 3220 in multitude, 7230 eating 398-6 and drinking, 8354-6 and making merry. 8056

4:21 And Solomon 8010 reigned 4910-6 over all kingdoms 4467 from the river 5104 unto the land 776 of the Philistines, 6430 and unto the border 1366 of Egypt: 4714 they brought 5066-56 presents, 4503 and served 5647-6 Solomon 8010 all the days 3117 of his life. 2416

4:22 And Solomon's 8010 provision 3899 for one 259 day 3117 was thirty 7970 measures 3734 of fine flour, 5560 and threescore 8346 measures 3734 of meal, 7058

4:23 Ten 6235 fat 1277 oxen, 1241 and twenty 6242 oxen 1241 out of the pastures, 7471 and an hundred 3967 sheep, 6629 beside harts, 354 and roebucks, 6643 and fallowdeer, 3180 and fatted 75-7 fowl. 1257

4:24 For he had dominion 7287-6 over all [the region] on this side 5676 the river, 5104 from Tiphsah 8607 even to Azzah, 5804 over all the kings 4428 on this side 5676 the river: 5104 and he had peace 7965 on all sides 5650|5676-q round about 5439 him.

4:25 And Judah 3063 and Israel 3478 dwelt 3427-4 safely, 983 every man 376 under his vine 1612 and under his fig tree, 8384 from Dan 1835 even to Beersheba, 884 all the days 3117 of Solomon. 8010

4:26 And Solomon 8010 had forty 705 thousand 505 stalls 723 of horses 5483 for his chariots, 4817 and twelve 8147 6240 thousand 505 horsemen. 6571

4:27 And those officers 5324-12 provided victual 3557-43 for king 4428 Solomon, 8010 and for all that came 7131 unto king 4428 Solomon's 8010 table, 7979 every man 376 in his month: 2320 they lacked 5737-17 nothing. 1697

4:28 Barley 8184 also and straw 8401 for the horses 5483 and dromedaries 7409 brought 935-55 they unto the place 4725 where [the officers] were, every man 376 according to his charge. 4941

4:29 And God 430 gave 5414-4 Solomon 8010 wisdom 2451 and understanding 8394 exceeding 3966 much, 7235-53 and largeness 7341 of heart, 3820 even as the sand 2344 that [is] on the sea 3220 shore. 8193

4:30 And Solomon's 8010 wisdom 2451 excelled 7235-4 the wisdom 2451 of all the children 1121 of the east 6924 country, and all the wisdom 2451 of Egypt. 4714

4:31 For he was wiser 2449-4 than all men; 120 than Ethan 387 the Ezrahite, 250 and Heman, 1968 and Chalcol, 3633 and Darda, 1862 the sons 1121 of Mahol: 4235 and his fame 8034 was in all nations 1471 round about. 5439

4:32 And he spake 1696-17 three 7969 thousand 505 proverbs: 4912 and his songs 7892 were a thousand 505 and five. 2568

4:33 And he spake 1696-17 of trees, 6086 from the cedar tree 730 that [is] in Lebanon 3844 even unto the hyssop 231 that springeth out 3318-6 of the wall: 7023 he spake 1696-17 also of beasts, 929 and of fowl, 5775 and of creeping things, 7431 and of fishes. 1709

4:34 And there came 935-4 of all people 5971 to hear 8085-2 the wisdom 2451 of Solomon, 8010 from all kings 4428 of the earth, 776 which had heard 8085-1 of his wisdom. 2451

5:1 And Hiram 2438 king 4428 of Tyre 6865 sent 7971-4 his servants 5650 unto Solomon; 8010 for he had heard 8085-1 that they had anointed 4886-1 him king 4428 in the room of his father: 1 for Hiram 2438 was ever 3605 3117 a lover 157-6 of David. 1732

5:2 And Solomon 8010 sent 7971-4 to Hiram, 2438 saying, 559-2

5:3 Thou knowest 3045-1 how that David 1732 my father 1 could 3201-1 not build 1129-2 an house 1004 unto the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 his God 430 for 6440 the wars 4421 which were about him on every side, 5437-1 until the LORD 3068 put 5414-2 them under the soles 3709 of his feet. 7272

5:4 But now the LORD 3068 my God 430 hath given me rest 5117-52 on every side, 5439 [so that there is] neither adversary 7854 nor evil 7451 occurrent. 6294

5:5 And, behold, I purpose 559-6 to build 1129-2 an house 1004 unto the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 my God, 430 as the LORD 3068 spake 1696-14 unto David 1732 my father, 1 saying, 559-2 Thy son, 1121 whom I will set 5414-4 upon thy throne 3678 in thy room, he shall build 1129-4 an house 1004 unto my name. 8034

5:6 Now therefore command 6680-16 thou that they hew 3772-4 me cedar trees 730 out of Lebanon; 3844 and my servants 5650 shall be with thy servants: 5650 and unto thee will I give 5414-4 hire 7939 for thy servants 5650 according to all that thou shalt appoint: 559-4 for thou knowest 3045-1 that [there is] not among us any 376 that can skill 3045-6 to hew 3772-2 timber 6086 like unto the Sidonians. 6722

5:7 And it came to pass, when Hiram 2438 heard 8085-2 the words 1697 of Solomon, 8010 that he rejoiced 8055-4 greatly, 3966 and said, 559-4 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD 3068 this day, 3117 which hath given 5414-1 unto David 1732 a wise 2450 son 1121 over this great 7227 people. 5971

5:8 And Hiram 2438 sent 7971-4 to Solomon, 8010 saying, 559-2 I have considered 8085-1 the things which thou sentest 7971-1 to me for: [and] I will do 6213-4 all thy desire 2656 concerning timber 6086 of cedar, 730 and concerning timber 6086 of fir. 1265

5:9 My servants 5650 shall bring [them] down 3381-55 from Lebanon 3844 unto the sea: 3220 and I will convey 7760-4 them by sea 3220 in floats 1702 unto the place 4725 that thou shalt appoint 7971-4 me, and will cause them to be discharged 5310-14 there, and thou shalt receive 5375-4 [them]: and thou shalt accomplish 6213-4 my desire, 2656 in giving 5414-2 food 3899 for my household. 1004

5:10 So Hiram 2438 gave 5414-6 Solomon 8010 cedar 730 trees 6086 and fir 1265 trees 6086 [according to] all his desire. 2656

5:11 And Solomon 8010 gave 5414-1 Hiram 2438 twenty 6242 thousand 505 measures 3734 of wheat 2406 [for] food 4361 to his household, 1004 and twenty 6242 measures 3734 of pure 3795 oil: 8081 thus gave 5414-4 Solomon 8010 to Hiram 2438 year 8141 by year. 8141

5:12 And the LORD 3068 gave 5414-1 Solomon 8010 wisdom, 2451 as he promised 1696-14 him: and there was peace 7965 between Hiram 2438 and Solomon; 8010 and they two 8147 made 3772-4 a league 1285 together.

5:13 And king 4428 Solomon 8010 raised 5927-55 a levy 4522 out of all Israel; 3478 and the levy 4522 was thirty 7970 thousand 505 men. 376

5:14 And he sent 7971-4 them to Lebanon, 3844 ten 6235 thousand 505 a month 2320 by courses: 2487 a month 2320 they were in Lebanon, 3844 [and] two 8147 months 2320 at home: 1004 and Adoniram 141 [was] over the levy. 4522

5:15 And Solomon 8010 had threescore and ten 7657 thousand 505 that bare 5375-6 burdens, 5449 and fourscore 8084 thousand 505 hewers 2672-6 in the mountains; 2022

5:16 Beside the chief 8269 of Solomon's 8010 officers 5324-12 which [were] over the work, 4399 three 7969 thousand 505 and three 7969 hundred, 3967 which ruled 7287-6 over the people 5971 that wrought 6213-6 in the work. 4399

5:17 And the king 4428 commanded, 6680-17 and they brought 5265-55 great 1419 stones, 68 costly 3368 stones, 68 [and] hewed 1496 stones, 68 to lay the foundation 3245-15 of the house. 1004

5:18 And Solomon's 8010 builders 1129-6 and Hiram's 2438 builders 1129-6 did hew 6458-4 [them], and the stonesquarers: 1382 so they prepared 3559-55 timber 6086 and stones 68 to build 1129-2 the house. 1004

6:1 And it came to pass in the four 702 hundred 3967 8141 and eightieth 8084 year 8141 after the children 1121 of Israel 3478 were come out 3318-2 of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 in the fourth 7243 year 8141 of Solomon's 8010 reign 4427-2 over Israel, 3478 in the month 2320 Zif, 2099 which [is] the second 8145 month, 2320 that he began to build 1129-4 the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

6:2 And the house 1004 which king 4428 Solomon 8010 built 1129-1 for the LORD, 3068 the length 753 thereof [was] threescore 8346 cubits, 520 and the breadth 7341 thereof twenty 6242 [cubits], and the height 6967 thereof thirty 7970 cubits. 520

6:3 And the porch 197 before 6440 the temple 1964 of the house, 1004 twenty 6242 cubits 520 [was] the length 753 thereof, according to 6440 the breadth 7341 of the house; 1004 [and] ten 6235 cubits 520 [was] the breadth 7341 thereof before 6440 the house. 1004

6:4 And for the house 1004 he made 6213-4 windows 2474 of narrow 331-5 lights. 8261

6:5 And against the wall 7023 of the house 1004 he built 1129-4 chambers 3326|3326-k round about, 5439 [against] the walls 7023 of the house 1004 round about, 5439 [both] of the temple 1964 and of the oracle: 1687 and he made 6213-4 chambers 6763 round about: 5439

6:6 The nethermost 8481 chamber 3326|3326-k [was] five 2568 cubits 520 broad, 7341 and the middle 8484 [was] six 8337 cubits 520 broad, 7341 and the third 7992 [was] seven 7651 cubits 520 broad: 7341 for without 2351 [in the wall] of the house 1004 he made 5414-1 narrowed rests 4052 round about, 5439 that [the beams] should not be fastened 270-2 in the walls 7023 of the house. 1004

6:7 And the house, 1004 when it was in building, 1129-9 was built 1129-8 of stone 68 made ready 8003 before it was brought 4551 thither: so that there was neither hammer 4717 nor axe 1631 [nor] any tool 3627 of iron 1270 heard 8085-8 in the house, 1004 while it was in building. 1129-9

6:8 The door 6607 for the middle 8484 chamber 6763 [was] in the right 3233 side 3802 of the house: 1004 and they went up 5927-4 with winding stairs 3883 into the middle 8484 [chamber], and out of the middle 8484 into the third. 7992

6:9 So he built 1129-4 the house, 1004 and finished 3615-17 it; and covered 5603-4 the house 1004 with beams 1356 and boards 7713 of cedar. 730

6:10 And [then] he built 1129-4 chambers 3326|3326-k against all the house, 1004 five 2568 cubits 520 high: 6967 and they rested 270-4 on the house 1004 [with] timber 6086 of cedar. 730

6:11 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came to Solomon, 8010 saying, 559-2

6:12 [Concerning] this house 1004 which thou art in building, 1129-6 if thou wilt walk 3212-4 in my statutes, 2708 and execute 6213-4 my judgments, 4941 and keep 8104-1 all my commandments 4687 to walk 3212-2 in them; then will I perform 6965-52 my word 1697 with thee, which I spake 1696-14 unto David 1732 thy father: 1

6:13 And I will dwell 7931-1 among 8432 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and will not forsake 5800-4 my people 5971 Israel. 3478

6:14 So Solomon 8010 built 1129-4 the house, 1004 and finished 3615-17 it.

6:15 And he built 1129-4 the walls 7023 of the house 1004 within 1004 with boards 6763 of cedar, 730 both the floor 7172 of the house, 1004 and the walls 7023 of the cieling: 5604 [and] he covered 6823-14 [them] on the inside 1004 with wood, 6086 and covered 6823-17 the floor 7172 of the house 1004 with planks 6763 of fir. 1265

6:16 And he built 1129-4 twenty 6242 cubits 520 on the sides 3411 of the house, 1004 both 4480 the floor 7172 and the walls 7023 with boards 6763 of cedar: 730 he even built 1129-4 [them] for it within, 1004 [even] for the oracle, 1687 [even] for the most 6944 holy 6944 [place].

6:17 And the house, 1004 that [is], the temple 1964 before it, 3942 was forty 705 cubits 520 [long].

6:18 And the cedar 730 of the house 1004 within 6441 [was] carved 4734 with knops 6497 and open 6358-7 flowers: 6731 all [was] cedar; 730 there was no stone 68 seen. 7200-8

6:19 And the oracle 1687 he prepared 3559-52 in 8432 the house 1004 within, 6441 to set 5414-2 there the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD. 3068

6:20 And the oracle 1687 in the forepart 6440 [was] twenty 6242 cubits 520 in length, 753 and twenty 6242 cubits 520 in breadth, 7341 and twenty 6242 cubits 520 in the height 6967 thereof: and he overlaid 6823-17 it with pure 5462-7 gold; 2091 and [so] covered 6823-17 the altar 4196 [which was of] cedar. 730

6:21 So Solomon 8010 overlaid 6823-17 the house 1004 within 6441 with pure 5462-7 gold: 2091 and he made a partition 5674-17 by the chains 7572|7572-k of gold 2091 before 6440 the oracle; 1687 and he overlaid 6823-17 it with gold. 2091

6:22 And the whole house 1004 he overlaid 6823-14 with gold, 2091 until he had finished 8552-2 all the house: 1004 also the whole altar 4196 that [was] by the oracle 1687 he overlaid 6823-14 with gold. 2091

6:23 And within the oracle 1687 he made 6213-4 two 8147 cherubims 3742 [of] olive 8081 tree, 6086 [each] ten 6235 cubits 520 high. 6967

6:24 And five 2568 cubits 520 [was] the one 259 wing 3671 of the cherub, 3742 and five 2568 cubits 520 the other 8145 wing 3671 of the cherub: 3742 from the uttermost part 7098 of the one wing 3671 unto the uttermost part 7098 of the other 3671 [were] ten 6235 cubits. 520

6:25 And the other 8145 cherub 3742 [was] ten 6235 cubits: 520 both 8147 the cherubims 3742 [were] of one 259 measure 4060 and one 259 size. 7095

6:26 The height 6967 of the one 259 cherub 3742 [was] ten 6235 cubits, 520 and so [was it] of the other 8145 cherub. 3742

6:27 And he set 5414-4 the cherubims 3742 within 8432 the inner 6442 house: 1004 and they stretched forth 6566-4 the wings 3671 of the cherubims, 3742 so that the wing 3671 of the one 259 touched 5060-4 the [one] wall, 7023 and the wing 3671 of the other 8145 cherub 3742 touched 5060-6 the other 8145 wall; 7023 and their wings 3671 touched 5060-6 one 3671 another 3671 in the midst 8432 of the house. 1004

6:28 And he overlaid 6823-17 the cherubims 3742 with gold. 2091

6:29 And he carved 7049-1 all the walls 7023 of the house 1004 round about 4524 with carved 6603 figures 4734 of cherubims 3742 and palm trees 8561 and open 6358-7 flowers, 6731 within 6441 and without. 2435

6:30 And the floor 7172 of the house 1004 he overlaid 6823-14 with gold, 2091 within 6441 and without. 2435

6:31 And for the entering 6607 of the oracle 1687 he made 6213-1 doors 1817 [of] olive 8081 tree: 6086 the lintel 352 [and] side posts 4201 [were] a fifth part 2549 [of the wall].

6:32 The two 8147 doors 1817 also [were of] olive 8081 tree; 6086 and he carved 7049-1 upon them carvings 4734 of cherubims 3742 and palm trees 8561 and open 6358-7 flowers, 6731 and overlaid 6823-14 [them] with gold, 2091 and spread 7286-55 gold 2091 upon the cherubims, 3742 and upon the palm trees. 8561

6:33 So also made 6213-1 he for the door 6607 of the temple 1964 posts 4201 [of] olive 8081 tree, 6086 a fourth 7243 part [of the wall].

6:34 And the two 8147 doors 1817 [were of] fir 1265 tree: 6086 the two 8147 leaves 6763 of the one 259 door 1817 [were] folding, 1550 and the two 8147 leaves 7050 of the other 8145 door 1817 [were] folding. 1550

6:35 And he carved 7049-1 [thereon] cherubims 3742 and palm trees 8561 and open 6358-7 flowers: 6731 and covered 6823-14 [them] with gold 2091 fitted 3474-30 upon the carved work. 2707-30

6:36 And he built 1129-4 the inner 6442 court 2691 with three 7969 rows 2905 of hewed stone, 1496 and a row 2905 of cedar 730 beams. 3773

6:37 In the fourth 7243 year 8141 was the foundation of the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 laid, 3245-27 in the month 3391 Zif: 2099

6:38 And in the eleventh 259 6240 year, 8141 in the month 3391 Bul, 945 which [is] the eighth 8066 month, 2320 was the house 1004 finished 3615-1 throughout all the parts 1697 thereof, and according to all the fashion 4941 of it. So was he seven 7651 years 8141 in building 1129-4 it.

7:1 But Solomon 8010 was building 1129-1 his own house 1004 thirteen 7969 6240 years, 8141 and he finished 3615-17 all his house. 1004

7:2 He built 1129-4 also the house 1004 of the forest 3293 of Lebanon; 3844 the length 753 thereof [was] an hundred 3967 cubits, 520 and the breadth 7341 thereof fifty 2572 cubits, 520 and the height 6967 thereof thirty 7970 cubits, 520 upon four 702 rows 2905 of cedar 730 pillars, 5982 with cedar 730 beams 3773 upon the pillars. 5982

7:3 And [it was] covered 5603-7 with cedar 730 above 4605 upon the beams, 6763 that [lay] on forty 705 five 2568 pillars, 5982 fifteen 2568 6240 [in] a row. 2905

7:4 And [there were] windows 8261 [in] three 7969 rows, 2905 and light 4237 [was] against light 4237 [in] three 7969 ranks. 6471

7:5 And all the doors 6607 and posts 4201 [were] square, 7251-7 with the windows: 8260 and light 4237 [was] against 4136 light 4237 [in] three 7969 ranks. 6471

7:6 And he made 6213-1 a porch 197 of pillars; 5982 the length 753 thereof [was] fifty 2572 cubits, 520 and the breadth 7341 thereof thirty 7970 cubits: 520 and the porch 197 [was] before 6440 them: and the [other] pillars 5982 and the thick beam 5646 [were] before 6440 them.

7:7 Then he made 6213-1 a porch 197 for the throne 3678 where he might judge, 8199-4 [even] the porch 197 of judgment: 4941 and [it was] covered 5603-7 with cedar 730 from one side of the floor 7172 to the other. 7172

7:8 And his house 1004 where he dwelt 3427-4 [had] another 312 court 2691 within 1004 the porch, 197 [which] was of the like work. 4639 Solomon 8010 made 6213-4 also an house 1004 for Pharaoh's 6547 daughter, 1323 whom he had taken 3947-1 [to wife], like unto this porch. 197

7:9 All these [were of] costly 3368 stones, 68 according to the measures 4060 of hewed stones, 1496 sawed 1641-21 with saws, 4050 within 1004 and without, 2351 even from the foundation 4527 unto the coping, 2947 and [so] on the outside 2351 toward the great 1419 court. 2691

7:10 And the foundation 3245-30 [was of] costly 3368 stones, 68 even great 1419 stones, 68 stones 68 of ten 6235 cubits, 520 and stones 68 of eight 8083 cubits. 520

7:11 And above 4605 [were] costly 3368 stones, 68 after the measures 4060 of hewed stones, 1496 and cedars. 730

7:12 And the great 1419 court 2691 round about 5439 [was] with three 7969 rows 2905 of hewed stones, 1496 and a row 2905 of cedar 730 beams, 3773 both for the inner 6442 court 2691 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and for the porch 197 of the house. 1004

7:13 And king 4428 Solomon 8010 sent 7971-4 and fetched 3947-4 Hiram 2438 out of Tyre. 6865

7:14 He [was] a widow's 802 490 son 1121 of the tribe 4294 of Naphtali, 5321 and his father 1 [was] a man 376 of Tyre, 6876 a worker 2790-6 in brass: 5178 and he was filled 4390-11 with wisdom, 2451 and understanding, 8394 and cunning 1847 to work 6213-2 all works 4399 in brass. 5178 And he came 935-4 to king 4428 Solomon, 8010 and wrought 6213-4 all his work. 4399

7:15 For he cast 6696-4 two 8147 pillars 5982 of brass, 5178 of eighteen 8083 6240 cubits 520 high 6967 apiece: 5982 259 and a line 2339 of twelve 8147 6240 cubits 520 did compass 5437-4 either 8145 of them 5982 about.

7:16 And he made 6213-1 two 8147 chapiters 3805 [of] molten 3332-94 brass, 5178 to set 5414-2 upon the tops 7218 of the pillars: 5982 the height 6967 of the one 259 chapiter 3805 [was] five 2568 cubits, 520 and the height 6967 of the other 8145 chapiter 3805 [was] five 2568 cubits: 520

7:17 [And] nets 7638 of checker 7639 work, 4639 and wreaths 1434 of chain 8333 work, 4639 for the chapiters 3805 which [were] upon the top 7218 of the pillars; 5982 seven 7651 for the one 259 chapiter, 3805 and seven 7651 for the other 8145 chapiter. 3805

7:18 And he made 6213-4 the pillars, 5982 and two 8147 rows 2905 round about 5439 upon the one 259 network, 7639 to cover 3680-15 the chapiters 3805 that [were] upon the top, 7218 with pomegranates: 7416 and so did 6213-1 he for the other 8145 chapiter. 3805

7:19 And the chapiters 3805 that [were] upon the top 7218 of the pillars 5982 [were] of lily 7799 work 4639 in the porch, 197 four 702 cubits. 520

7:20 And the chapiters 3805 upon the two 8147 pillars 5982 [had pomegranates] also above, 4605 over against 5980 the belly 990 which [was] by 5676 the network: 7639 and the pomegranates 7416 [were] two hundred 3967 in rows 2905 round about 5439 upon the other 8145 chapiter. 3805

7:21 And he set up 6965-55 the pillars 5982 in the porch 197 of the temple: 1964 and he set up 6965-55 the right 3233 pillar, 5982 and called 7121-4 the name 8034 thereof Jachin: 3199 and he set up 6965-55 the left 8042 pillar, 5982 and called 7121-4 the name 8034 thereof Boaz. 1162

7:22 And upon the top 7218 of the pillars 5982 [was] lily 7799 work: 4639 so was the work 4399 of the pillars 5982 finished. 8552-4

7:23 And he made 6213-4 a molten 3332-94 sea, 3220 ten 6235 cubits 520 from the one brim 8193 to the other: 8193 [it was] round 5696 all about, 5439 and his height 6967 [was] five 2568 cubits: 520 and a line 6957|6961-k of thirty 7970 cubits 520 did compass 5437-4 it round about. 5439

7:24 And under the brim 8193 of it round about 5439 [there were] knops 6497 compassing 5437-6 it, ten 6235 in a cubit, 520 compassing 5362-56 the sea 3220 round about: 5439 the knops 6497 [were] cast 3332-7 in two 8147 rows, 2905 when it was cast. 3333

7:25 It stood 5975-6 upon twelve 8147 6240 oxen, 1241 three 7969 looking 6437-6 toward the north, 6828 and three 7969 looking 6437-6 toward the west, 3220 and three 7969 looking 6437-6 toward the south, 5045 and three 7969 looking 6437-6 toward the east: 4217 and the sea 3220 [was set] above 4605 upon them, and all their hinder parts 268 [were] inward. 1004

7:26 And it [was] an hand breadth 2947 thick, 5672 and the brim 8193 thereof was wrought 4639 like the brim 8193 of a cup, 3563 with flowers 6525 of lilies: 7799 it contained 3557-55 two thousand 505 baths. 1324

7:27 And he made 6213-4 ten 6235 bases 4350 of brass; 5178 four 702 cubits 520 [was] the length 753 of one 259 base, 4350 and four 702 cubits 520 the breadth 7341 thereof, and three 7969 cubits 520 the height 6967 of it.

7:28 And the work 4639 of the bases 4350 [was] on this [manner]: they had borders, 4526 and the borders 4526 [were] between the ledges: 7948

7:29 And on the borders 4526 that [were] between the ledges 7948 [were] lions, 738 oxen, 1241 and cherubims: 3742 and upon the ledges 7948 [there was] a base 3653 above: 4605 and beneath the lions 738 and oxen 1241 [were] certain additions 3914 made of thin 4174 work. 4639

7:30 And every 259 base 4350 had four 702 brasen 5178 wheels, 212 and plates 5633 of brass: 5178 and the four 702 corners 6471 thereof had undersetters: 3802 under the laver 3595 [were] undersetters 3802 molten, 3332-7 at the side 5676 of every 376 addition. 3914

7:31 And the mouth 6310 of it within 1004 the chapiter 3805 and above 4605 [was] a cubit: 520 but the mouth 6310 thereof [was] round 5696 [after] the work 4639 of the base, 3653 a cubit 520 and an half: 2677 and also upon the mouth 6310 of it [were] gravings 4734 with their borders, 4526 foursquare, 7251-30 not round. 5696

7:32 And under 8478 the borders 4526 [were] four 702 wheels; 212 and the axletrees 3027 of the wheels 212 [were joined] to the base: 4350 and the height 6967 of a 259 wheel 212 [was] a cubit 520 and half 2677 a cubit. 520

7:33 And the work 4639 of the wheels 212 [was] like the work 4639 of a chariot 4818 wheel: 212 their axletrees, 3027 and their naves, 1354 and their felloes, 2839 and their spokes, 2840 [were] all molten. 3332-94

7:34 And [there were] four 702 undersetters 3802 to the four 702 corners 6438 of one 259 base: 4350 [and] the undersetters 3802 [were] of the very base 4350 itself.

7:35 And in the top 7218 of the base 4350 [was there] a round 5696 compass 5439 of half 2677 a cubit 520 high: 6967 and on the top 7218 of the base 4350 the ledges 3027 thereof and the borders 4526 thereof [were] of the same.

7:36 For on the plates 3871 of the ledges 3027 thereof, and on the borders 4526 thereof, he graved 6605-17 cherubims, 3742 lions, 738 and palm trees, 8561 according to the proportion 4626 of every one, 376 and additions 3914 round about. 5439

7:37 After this [manner] he made 6213-1 the ten 6235 bases: 4350 all of them had one 259 casting, 4165 one 259 measure, 4060 [and] one 259 size. 7095

7:38 Then made 6213-4 he ten 6235 lavers 3595 of brass: 5178 one 259 laver 3595 contained 3557-55 forty 705 baths: 1324 [and] every 259 laver 3595 was four 702 cubits: 520 [and] upon every one 259 4350 of the ten 6235 bases 4350 one 259 laver. 3595

7:39 And he put 5414-4 five 2568 bases 4350 on the right 3225 side 3802 of the house, 1004 and five 2568 on the left 8040 side 3802 of the house: 1004 and he set 5414-1 the sea 3220 on the right 3233 side 3802 of the house 1004 eastward 6924 over against 4136 the south. 5045

7:40 And Hiram 2438 made 6213-4 the lavers, 3595 and the shovels, 3257 and the basons. 4219 So Hiram 2438 made an end 3615-17 of doing 6213-2 all the work 4399 that he made 6213-1 king 4428 Solomon 8010 for the house 1004 of the LORD: 3068

7:41 The two 8147 pillars, 5982 and the [two] bowls 1543 of the chapiters 3805 that [were] on the top 7218 of the two 8147 pillars; 5982 and the two 8147 networks, 7639 to cover 3680-15 the two 8147 bowls 1543 of the chapiters 3805 which [were] upon the top 7218 of the pillars; 5982

7:42 And four 702 hundred 3967 pomegranates 7416 for the two 8147 networks, 7639 [even] two 8147 rows 2905 of pomegranates 7416 for one 259 network, 7639 to cover 3680-15 the two 8147 bowls 1543 of the chapiters 3805 that [were] upon 6440 the pillars; 5982

7:43 And the ten 6235 bases, 4350 and ten 6235 lavers 3595 on the bases; 4350

7:44 And one 259 sea, 3220 and twelve 8147 6240 oxen 1241 under the sea; 3220

7:45 And the pots, 5518 and the shovels, 3257 and the basons: 4219 and all these vessels, 3627 which Hiram 2438 made 6213-1 to king 4428 Solomon 8010 for the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 [were of] bright 4803-30 brass. 5178

7:46 In the plain 3603 of Jordan 3383 did the king 4428 cast 3332-1 them, in the clay 4568 ground 127 between Succoth 5523 and Zarthan. 6891

7:47 And Solomon 8010 left 3240-55 all the vessels 3627 [unweighed], because they were exceeding 3966 3966 many: 7230 neither was the weight 4948 of the brass 5178 found out. 2713-8

7:48 And Solomon 8010 made 6213-4 all the vessels 3627 that [pertained] unto the house 1004 of the LORD: 3068 the altar 4196 of gold, 2091 and the table 7979 of gold, 2091 whereupon the shewbread 3899 6440 [was],

7:49 And the candlesticks 4501 of pure 5462-7 gold, 2091 five 2568 on the right 3225 [side], and five 2568 on the left, 8040 before 6440 the oracle, 1687 with the flowers, 6525 and the lamps, 5216 and the tongs 4457 [of] gold, 2091

7:50 And the bowls, 5592 and the snuffers, 4212 and the basons, 4219 and the spoons, 3709 and the censers 4289 [of] pure 5462-7 gold; 2091 and the hinges 6596 [of] gold, 2091 [both] for the doors 1817 of the inner 6442 house, 1004 the most 6944 holy 6944 [place, and] for the doors 1817 of the house, 1004 [to wit], of the temple. 1964

7:51 So was ended 7999-4 all the work 4399 that king 4428 Solomon 8010 made 6213-1 for the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068 And Solomon 8010 brought in 935-55 the things which David 1732 his father 1 had dedicated; 6944 [even] the silver, 3701 and the gold, 2091 and the vessels, 3627 did he put 5414-1 among the treasures 214 of the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

8:1 Then Solomon 8010 assembled 6950-55 the elders 2205 of Israel, 3478 and all the heads 7218 of the tribes, 4294 the chief 5387 of the fathers 1 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 unto king 4428 Solomon 8010 in Jerusalem, 3389 that they might bring up 5927-53 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 out of the city 5892 of David, 1732 which [is] Zion. 6726

8:2 And all the men 376 of Israel 3478 assembled 6950-11 themselves unto king 4428 Solomon 8010 at the feast 2282 in the month 3391 Ethanim, 388|386 which [is] the seventh 7637 month. 2320

8:3 And all the elders 2205 of Israel 3478 came, 935-4 and the priests 3548 took up 5375-4 the ark. 727

8:4 And they brought up 5927-55 the ark 727 of the LORD, 3068 and the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and all the holy 6944 vessels 3627 that [were] in the tabernacle, 168 even those did the priests 3548 and the Levites 3881 bring up. 5927-55

8:5 And king 4428 Solomon, 8010 and all the congregation 5712 of Israel, 3478 that were assembled 3259-12 unto him, [were] with him before 6440 the ark, 727 sacrificing 2076-18 sheep 6629 and oxen, 1241 that could not be told 5608-11 nor numbered 4487-11 for multitude. 7230

8:6 And the priests 3548 brought in 935-55 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 unto his place, 4725 into the oracle 1687 of the house, 1004 to the most 6944 holy 6944 [place, even] under the wings 3671 of the cherubims. 3742

8:7 For the cherubims 3742 spread 6566-6 forth [their] two wings 3671 over the place 4725 of the ark, 727 and the cherubims 3742 covered 5526-4 the ark 727 and the staves 905 thereof above. 4605

8:8 And they drew out 748-55 the staves, 905 that the ends 7218 of the staves 905 were seen 7200-11 out in the holy 6944 [place] before 6440 the oracle, 1687 and they were not seen 7200-11 without: 2351 and there they are unto this day. 3117

8:9 [There was] nothing in the ark 727 save 7535 the two 8147 tables 3871 of stone, 68 which Moses 4872 put 3240-52 there at Horeb, 2722 when the LORD 3068 made 3772-1 [a covenant] with the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 when they came out 3318-2 of the land 776 of Egypt. 4714

8:10 And it came to pass, when the priests 3548 were come out 3318-2 of the holy 6944 [place], that the cloud 6051 filled 4390-1 the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068

8:11 So that the priests 3548 could 3201-1 not stand 5975-2 to minister 8334-15 because 6440 of the cloud: 6051 for the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 had filled 4390-1 the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

8:12 Then spake 559-1 Solomon, 8010 The LORD 3068 said 559-1 that he would dwell 7931-2 in the thick darkness. 6205

8:13 I have surely 1129-2 built 1129-1 thee an house 1004 to dwell in, 2073 a settled place 4349 for thee to abide in 3427-2 for ever. 5769

8:14 And the king 4428 turned his face 6440 about, 5437-55 and blessed 1288-17 all the congregation 6951 of Israel: 3478 (and all the congregation 6951 of Israel 3478 stood;) 5975-6

8:15 And he said, 559-4 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 which spake 1696-14 with his mouth 6310 unto David 1732 my father, 1 and hath with his hand 3027 fulfilled 4390-14 [it], saying, 559-2

8:16 Since the day 3117 that I brought forth 3318-52 my people 5971 Israel 3478 out of Egypt, 4714 I chose 977-1 no city 5892 out of all the tribes 7626 of Israel 3478 to build 1129-2 an house, 1004 that my name 8034 might be therein; but I chose 977-4 David 1732 to be over my people 5971 Israel. 3478

8:17 And it was in the heart 3824 of David 1732 my father 1 to build 1129-2 an house 1004 for the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel. 3478

8:18 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto David 1732 my father, 1 Whereas 3282 834 it was in thine heart 3824 to build 1129-2 an house 1004 unto my name, 8034 thou didst well 2895-52 that it was in thine heart. 3824

8:19 Nevertheless 7535 thou shalt not build 1129-4 the house; 1004 but thy son 1121 that shall come forth 3318-6 out of thy loins, 2504 he shall build 1129-4 the house 1004 unto my name. 8034

8:20 And the LORD 3068 hath performed 6965-55 his word 1697 that he spake, 1696-14 and I am risen up 6965-4 in the room of David 1732 my father, 1 and sit 3427-4 on the throne 3678 of Israel, 3478 as the LORD 3068 promised, 1696-14 and have built 1129-4 an house 1004 for the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel. 3478

8:21 And I have set 7760-4 there a place 4725 for the ark, 727 wherein [is] the covenant 1285 of the LORD, 3068 which he made 3772-1 with our fathers, 1 when he brought them out 3318-53 of the land 776 of Egypt. 4714

8:22 And Solomon 8010 stood 5975-4 before 6440 the altar 4196 of the LORD 3068 in the presence of 5048 all the congregation 6951 of Israel, 3478 and spread forth 6566-4 his hands 3709 toward heaven: 8064

8:23 And he said, 559-4 LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 [there is] no God 430 like thee, in heaven 8064 above, 4605 or on earth 776 beneath, who keepest 8104-6 covenant 1285 and mercy 2617 with thy servants 5650 that walk 1980-6 before 6440 thee with all their heart: 3820

8:24 Who hast kept 8104-1 with thy servant 5650 David 1732 my father 1 that thou promisedst 1696-14 him: thou spakest 1696-17 also with thy mouth, 6310 and hast fulfilled 4390-14 [it] with thine hand, 3027 as [it is] this day. 3117

8:25 Therefore now, LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 keep 8104-3 with thy servant 5650 David 1732 my father 1 that thou promisedst 1696-14 him, saying, 559-2 There shall not fail 3772-11 thee a man 376 in my sight 6440 to sit 3427-6 on the throne 3678 of Israel; 3478 so 7535 that thy children 1121 take heed 8104-4 to their way, 1870 that they walk 3212-2 before 6440 me as thou hast walked 1980-1 before 6440 me.

8:26 And now, O God 430 of Israel, 3478 let thy word, 1697 I pray thee, be verified, 539-11 which thou spakest 1696-14 unto thy servant 5650 David 1732 my father. 1

8:27 But will God 430 indeed 552 dwell 3427-4 on the earth? 776 behold, the heaven 8064 and heaven 8064 of heavens 8064 cannot contain 3557-46 thee; how much less 637 this house 1004 that I have builded? 1129-1

8:28 Yet have thou respect 6437-1 unto the prayer 8605 of thy servant, 5650 and to his supplication, 8467 O LORD 3068 my God, 430 to hearken 8085-2 unto the cry 7440 and to the prayer, 8605 which thy servant 5650 prayeth 6419-102 before 6440 thee to day: 3117

8:29 That thine eyes 5869 may be open 6605-7 toward this house 1004 night 3915 and day, 3117 [even] toward the place 4725 of which thou hast said, 559-1 My name 8034 shall be there: that thou mayest hearken 8085-2 unto the prayer 8605 which thy servant 5650 shall make 6419-101 toward this place. 4725

8:30 And hearken 8085-1 thou to the supplication 8467 of thy servant, 5650 and of thy people 5971 Israel, 3478 when they shall pray 6419-101 toward this place: 4725 and hear 8085-4 thou in heaven 8064 thy dwelling 3427-2 place: 4725 and when thou hearest, 8085-1 forgive. 5545-1

8:31 If any man 376 trespass 2398-4 against his neighbour, 7453 and an oath 423 be laid 5375-1 upon him to cause him to swear, 422-53 and the oath 423 come 935-1 before 6440 thine altar 4196 in this house: 1004

8:32 Then hear 8085-4 thou in heaven, 8064 and do, 6213-1 and judge 8199-1 thy servants, 5650 condemning 7561-53 the wicked, 7563 to bring 5414-2 his way 1870 upon his head; 7218 and justifying 6663-53 the righteous, 6662 to give 5414-2 him according to his righteousness. 6666

8:33 When thy people 5971 Israel 3478 be smitten down 5062-9 before 6440 the enemy, 341-6 because they have sinned 2398-4 against thee, and shall turn 7725-1 again to thee, and confess 3034-52 thy name, 8034 and pray, 6419-98 and make supplication 2603-98 unto thee in this house: 1004

8:34 Then hear 8085-4 thou in heaven, 8064 and forgive 5545-1 the sin 2403 of thy people 5971 Israel, 3478 and bring them again 7725-52 unto the land 127 which thou gavest 5414-1 unto their fathers. 1

8:35 When heaven 8064 is shut up, 6113-9 and there is no rain, 4306 because they have sinned 2398-4 against thee; if they pray 6419-98 toward this place, 4725 and confess 3034-52 thy name, 8034 and turn 7725-4 from their sin, 2403 when thou afflictest 6031-55 them:

8:36 Then hear 8085-4 thou in heaven, 8064 and forgive 5545-1 the sin 2403 of thy servants, 5650 and of thy people 5971 Israel, 3478 that thou teach 3384-55 them the good 2896 way 1870 wherein they should walk, 3212-4 and give 5414-1 rain 4306 upon thy land, 776 which thou hast given 5414-1 to thy people 5971 for an inheritance. 5159

8:37 If there be in the land 776 famine, 7458 if there be pestilence, 1698 blasting, 7711 mildew, 3420 locust, 697 [or] if there be caterpiller; 2625 if their enemy 341-6 besiege 6887-55 them in the land 776 of their cities; 8179 whatsoever plague, 5061 whatsoever sickness 4245 [there be];

8:38 What prayer 8605 and supplication 8467 soever be [made] by any man, 120 [or] by all thy people 5971 Israel, 3478 which shall know 3045-4 every man 376 the plague 5061 of his own heart, 3824 and spread forth 6566-1 his hands 3709 toward this house: 1004

8:39 Then hear 8085-4 thou in heaven 8064 thy dwelling 3427-2 place, 4349 and forgive, 5545-1 and do, 6213-1 and give 5414-1 to every man 376 according to his ways, 1870 whose heart 3824 thou knowest; 3045-4 (for thou, [even] thou only, knowest 3045-1 the hearts 3824 of all the children 1121 of men;) 120

8:40 That they may fear 3372-4 thee all the days 3117 that they live 2416 in 6440 the land 127 which thou gavest 5414-1 unto our fathers. 1

8:41 Moreover concerning a stranger, 5237 that [is] not of thy people 5971 Israel, 3478 but cometh 935-1 out of a far 7350 country 776 for thy name's 8034 sake; 4616

8:42 (For they shall hear 8085-4 of thy great 1419 name, 8034 and of thy strong 2389 hand, 3027 and of thy stretched out 5186-7 arm;) 2220 when he shall come 935-1 and pray 6419-98 toward this house; 1004

8:43 Hear 8085-4 thou in heaven 8064 thy dwelling 3427-2 place, 4349 and do 6213-1 according to all that the stranger 5237 calleth 7121-4 to thee for: that all people 5971 of the earth 776 may know 3045-4 thy name, 8034 to fear 3372-2 thee, as [do] thy people 5971 Israel; 3478 and that they may know 3045-2 that this house, 1004 which I have builded, 1129-1 is called 7121-8 by thy name. 8034

8:44 If thy people 5971 go out 3318-4 to battle 4421 against their enemy, 341-6 whithersoever 1870 thou shalt send 7971-4 them, and shall pray 6419-98 unto the LORD 3068 toward 1870 the city 5892 which thou hast chosen, 977-1 and [toward] the house 1004 that I have built 1129-1 for thy name: 8034

8:45 Then hear 8085-1 thou in heaven 8064 their prayer 8605 and their supplication, 8467 and maintain 6213-1 their cause. 4941

8:46 If they sin 2398-4 against thee, (for [there is] no man 120 that sinneth 2398-4 not,) and thou be angry 599-1 with them, and deliver 5414-1 them to 6440 the enemy, 341-6 so that they carry them away 7617-1 captives 7617-6 unto the land 776 of the enemy, 341-6 far 7350 or near; 7138

8:47 [Yet] if they shall bethink 7725-52 3820 themselves in the land 776 whither they were carried captives, 7617-8 and repent, 7725-1 and make supplication 2603-98 unto thee in the land 776 of them that carried them captives, 7617-6 saying, 559-2 We have sinned, 2398-1 and have done perversely, 5753-52 we have committed wickedness; 7561-1

8:48 And [so] return 7725-1 unto thee with all their heart, 3824 and with all their soul, 5315 in the land 776 of their enemies, 341-6 which led them away captive, 7617-1 and pray 6419-98 unto thee toward 1870 their land, 776 which thou gavest 5414-1 unto their fathers, 1 the city 5892 which thou hast chosen, 977-1 and the house 1004 which I have built 1129-1 for thy name: 8034

8:49 Then hear 8085-1 thou their prayer 8605 and their supplication 8467 in heaven 8064 thy dwelling 3427-2 place, 4349 and maintain 6213-1 their cause, 4941

8:50 And forgive 5545-1 thy people 5971 that have sinned 2398-1 against thee, and all their transgressions 6588 wherein they have transgressed 6586-1 against thee, and give 5414-1 them compassion 7356 before 6440 them who carried them captive, 7617-6 that they may have compassion 7355-14 on them:

8:51 For they [be] thy people, 5971 and thine inheritance, 5159 which thou broughtest forth 3318-52 out of Egypt, 4714 from the midst 8432 of the furnace 3564 of iron: 1270

8:52 That thine eyes 5869 may be open 6605-7 unto the supplication 8467 of thy servant, 5650 and unto the supplication 8467 of thy people 5971 Israel, 3478 to hearken 8085-2 unto them in all that they call 7121-2 for unto thee.

8:53 For thou didst separate 914-52 them from among all the people 5971 of the earth, 776 [to be] thine inheritance, 5159 as thou spakest 1696-14 by the hand 3027 of Moses 4872 thy servant, 5650 when thou broughtest our fathers 1 out 3318-53 of Egypt, 4714 O Lord 136 GOD. 3069

8:54 And it was [so], that when Solomon 8010 had made an end 3615-15 of praying 6419-99 all this prayer 8605 and supplication 8467 unto the LORD, 3068 he arose 6965-1 from before 6440 the altar 4196 of the LORD, 3068 from kneeling 3766-2 on his knees 1290 with his hands 3709 spread 6566-7 up to heaven. 8064

8:55 And he stood, 5975-4 and blessed 1288-17 all the congregation 6951 of Israel 3478 with a loud 1419 voice, 6963 saying, 559-2

8:56 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD, 3068 that hath given 5414-1 rest 4496 unto his people 5971 Israel, 3478 according to all that he promised: 1696-14 there hath not failed 5307-1 one 259 word 1697 of all his good 2896 promise, 1697 which he promised 1696-14 by the hand 3027 of Moses 4872 his servant. 5650

8:57 The LORD 3068 our God 430 be with us, as he was with our fathers: 1 let him not leave 5800-4 us, nor forsake 5203-4 us:

8:58 That he may incline 5186-53 our hearts 3824 unto him, to walk 3212-2 in all his ways, 1870 and to keep 8104-2 his commandments, 4687 and his statutes, 2706 and his judgments, 4941 which he commanded 6680-14 our fathers. 1

8:59 And let these my words, 1697 wherewith I have made supplication 2603-98 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 be nigh 7138 unto the LORD 3068 our God 430 day 3119 and night, 3915 that he maintain 6213-2 the cause 4941 of his servant, 5650 and the cause 4941 of his people 5971 Israel 3478 at all times, 3117 3117 as the matter 1697 shall require:

8:60 That all the people 5971 of the earth 776 may know 3045-2 that the LORD 3068 [is] God, 430 [and that there is] none else.

8:61 Let your heart 3824 therefore be perfect 8003 with the LORD 3068 our God, 430 to walk 3212-2 in his statutes, 2706 and to keep 8104-2 his commandments, 4687 as at this day. 3117

8:62 And the king, 4428 and all Israel 3478 with him, offered 2076-6 sacrifice 2077 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

8:63 And Solomon 8010 offered 2076-4 a sacrifice 2077 of peace offerings, 8002 which he offered 2076-1 unto the LORD, 3068 two 8147 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 oxen, 1241 and an hundred 3967 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 sheep. 6629 So the king 4428 and all the children 1121 of Israel 3478 dedicated 2596-4 the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

8:64 The same day 3117 did the king 4428 hallow 6942-14 the middle 8432 of the court 2691 that [was] before 6440 the house 1004 of the LORD: 3068 for there he offered 6213-1 burnt offerings, 5930 and meat offerings, 4503 and the fat 2459 of the peace offerings: 8002 because the brasen 5178 altar 4196 that [was] before 6440 the LORD 3068 [was] too little 6996 to receive 3557-53 the burnt offerings, 5930 and meat offerings, 4503 and the fat 2459 of the peace offerings. 8002

8:65 And at that time 6256 Solomon 8010 held 6213-4 a feast, 2282 and all Israel 3478 with him, a great 1419 congregation, 6951 from the entering in 935-2 of Hamath 2574 unto the river 5158 of Egypt, 4714 before 6440 the LORD 3068 our God, 430 seven 7651 days 3117 and seven 7651 days, 3117 [even] fourteen 702 6240 days. 3117

8:66 On the eighth 8066 day 3117 he sent the people 5971 away: 7971-14 and they blessed 1288-17 the king, 4428 and went 3212-4 unto their tents 168 joyful 8056 and glad 2896 of heart 3820 for all the goodness 2896 that the LORD 3068 had done 6213-1 for David 1732 his servant, 5650 and for Israel 3478 his people. 5971

9:1 And it came to pass, when Solomon 8010 had finished 3615-15 the building 1129-2 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and the king's 4428 house, 1004 and all Solomon's 8010 desire 2837 which he was pleased 2654-1 to do, 6213-2

9:2 That the LORD 3068 appeared 7200-11 to Solomon 8010 the second time, 8145 as he had appeared 7200-8 unto him at Gibeon. 1391

9:3 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, I have heard 8085-1 thy prayer 8605 and thy supplication, 8467 that thou hast made 2603-98 before 6440 me: I have hallowed 6942-52 this house, 1004 which thou hast built, 1129-1 to put 7760-2 my name 8034 there for 5704 ever; 5769 and mine eyes 5869 and mine heart 3820 shall be there perpetually. 3605 3117

9:4 And if thou wilt walk 3212-4 before 6440 me, as David 1732 thy father 1 walked, 1980-1 in integrity 8537 of heart, 3824 and in uprightness, 3476 to do 6213-2 according to all that I have commanded 6680-14 thee, [and] wilt keep 8104-4 my statutes 2706 and my judgments: 4941

9:5 Then I will establish 6965-52 the throne 3678 of thy kingdom 4467 upon Israel 3478 for ever, 5769 as I promised 1696-14 to David 1732 thy father, 1 saying, 559-2 There shall not fail 3772-11 thee a man 376 upon the throne 3678 of Israel. 3478

9:6 [But] if ye shall at all 7725-2 turn 7725-4 from following 310 me, ye or your children, 1121 and will not keep 8104-4 my commandments 4687 [and] my statutes 2708 which I have set 5414-1 before 6440 you, but go 1980-1 and serve 5647-1 other 312 gods, 430 and worship 7812-98 them:

9:7 Then will I cut off 3772-52 Israel 3478 out 6440 of the land 127 which I have given 5414-1 them; and this house, 1004 which I have hallowed 6942-52 for my name, 8034 will I cast out 7971-17 of my sight; 6440 and Israel 3478 shall be a proverb 4912 and a byword 8148 among all people: 5971

9:8 And at this house, 1004 [which] is high, 5945 every one that passeth 5674-6 by it shall be astonished, 8074-4 and shall hiss; 8319-1 and they shall say, 559-1 Why hath the LORD 3068 done 6213-1 thus unto this land, 776 and to this house? 1004

9:9 And they shall answer, 559-1 Because they forsook 5800-1 the LORD 3068 their God, 430 who brought forth 3318-52 their fathers 1 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 and have taken hold 2388-55 upon other 312 gods, 430 and have worshipped 7812-101 them, and served 5647-4 them: therefore hath the LORD 3068 brought 935-52 upon them all this evil. 7451

9:10 And it came to pass at the end 7097 of twenty 6242 years, 8141 when Solomon 8010 had built 1129-1 the two 8147 houses, 1004 the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and the king's 4428 house, 1004

9:11 ([Now] Hiram 2438 the king 4428 of Tyre 6865 had furnished 5375-14 Solomon 8010 with cedar 730 trees 6086 and fir 1265 trees, 6086 and with gold, 2091 according to all his desire,) 2656 that then 227 king 4428 Solomon 8010 gave 5414-4 Hiram 2438 twenty 6242 cities 5892 in the land 776 of Galilee. 1551

9:12 And Hiram 2438 came out 3318-4 from Tyre 6865 to see 7200-2 the cities 5892 which Solomon 8010 had given 5414-1 him; and they pleased 3474-1 5869 him not.

9:13 And he said, 559-4 What cities 5892 [are] these which thou hast given 5414-1 me, my brother? 251 And he called 7121-4 them the land 776 of Cabul 3521 unto this day. 3117

9:14 And Hiram 2438 sent 7971-4 to the king 4428 sixscore 3967 6242 talents 3603 of gold. 2091

9:15 And this [is] the reason 1697 of the levy 4522 which king 4428 Solomon 8010 raised; 5927-52 for to build 1129-2 the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and his own house, 1004 and Millo, 4407 and the wall 2346 of Jerusalem, 3389 and Hazor, 2674 and Megiddo, 4023 and Gezer. 1507

9:16 [For] Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt 4714 had gone up, 5927-1 and taken 3920-4 Gezer, 1507 and burnt 8313-4 it with fire, 784 and slain 2026-1 the Canaanites 3669 that dwelt 3427-6 in the city, 5892 and given 5414-4 it [for] a present 7964 unto his daughter, 1323 Solomon's 8010 wife. 802

9:17 And Solomon 8010 built 1129-4 Gezer, 1507 and Bethhoron 1032 the nether, 8481

9:18 And Baalath, 1191 and Tadmor 8412|8559 in the wilderness, 4057 in the land, 776

9:19 And all the cities 5892 of store 4543 that Solomon 8010 had, and cities 5892 for his chariots, 7393 and cities 5892 for his horsemen, 6571 and that 2837 which Solomon 8010 desired 2836-1 to build 1129-2 in Jerusalem, 3389 and in Lebanon, 3844 and in all the land 776 of his dominion. 4475

9:20 [And] all the people 5971 [that were] left 3498-12 of the Amorites, 567 Hittites, 2850 Perizzites, 6522 Hivites, 2340 and Jebusites, 2983 which [were] not of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478

9:21 Their children 1121 that were left 3498-8 after 310 them in the land, 776 whom the children 1121 of Israel 3478 also were not able 3201-1 utterly to destroy, 2763-53 upon those did Solomon 8010 levy 5927-55 a tribute 4522 of bondservice 5647-6 unto this day. 3117

9:22 But of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did Solomon 8010 make 5414-1 no bondmen: 5650 but they [were] men 582 of war, 4421 and his servants, 5650 and his princes, 8269 and his captains, 7991 and rulers 8269 of his chariots, 7393 and his horsemen. 6571

9:23 These [were] the chief 8269 of the officers 5324-12 that [were] over Solomon's 8010 work, 4399 five 2568 hundred 3967 and fifty, 2572 which bare rule 7287-6 over the people 5971 that wrought 6213-6 in the work. 4399

9:24 But Pharaoh's 6547 daughter 1323 came up 5927-1 out of the city 5892 of David 1732 unto her house 1004 which [Solomon] had built 1129-1 for her: then did he build 1129-1 Millo. 4407

9:25 And three 7969 times 6471 in a year 8141 did Solomon 8010 offer 5927-52 burnt offerings 5930 and peace offerings 8002 upon the altar 4196 which he built 1129-1 unto the LORD, 3068 and he burnt incense 6999-53 upon the altar that [was] before 6440 the LORD. 3068 So he finished 7999-14 the house. 1004

9:26 And king 4428 Solomon 8010 made 6213-1 a navy of ships 590 in Eziongeber, 6100 which [is] beside Eloth, 359 on the shore 8193 of the Red 5488 sea, 3220 in the land 776 of Edom. 123

9:27 And Hiram 2438 sent 7971-4 in the navy 590 his servants, 5650 shipmen 582 591 that had knowledge 3045-6 of the sea, 3220 with the servants 5650 of Solomon. 8010

9:28 And they came 935-4 to Ophir, 211 and fetched 3947-4 from thence gold, 2091 four 702 hundred 3967 and twenty 6242 talents, 3603 and brought 935-55 [it] to king 4428 Solomon. 8010

10:1 And when the queen 4436 of Sheba 7614 heard 8085-6 of the fame 8088 of Solomon 8010 concerning the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 she came 935-4 to prove 5254-15 him with hard questions. 2420

10:2 And she came 935-4 to Jerusalem 3389 with a very 3966 great 3515 train, 2428 with camels 1581 that bare 5375-6 spices, 1314 and very 3966 much 7227 gold, 2091 and precious 3368 stones: 68 and when she was come 935-4 to Solomon, 8010 she communed 1696-17 with him of all that was in her heart. 3824

10:3 And Solomon 8010 told 5046-55 her all her questions: 1697 there was not [any] thing 1697 hid 5956-12 from the king, 4428 which he told 5046-52 her not.

10:4 And when the queen 4436 of Sheba 7614 had seen 7200-4 all Solomon's 8010 wisdom, 2451 and the house 1004 that he had built, 1129-1

10:5 And the meat 3978 of his table, 7979 and the sitting 4186 of his servants, 5650 and the attendance 4612 of his ministers, 8334-18 and their apparel, 4403 and his cupbearers, 8248-56 and his ascent 5930 by which he went up 5927-4 unto the house 1004 of the LORD; 3068 there was no more spirit 7307 in her.

10:6 And she said 559-4 to the king, 4428 It was a true 571 report 1697 that I heard 8085-1 in mine own land 776 of thy acts 1697 and of thy wisdom. 2451

10:7 Howbeit I believed 539-52 not the words, 1697 until I came, 935-1 and mine eyes 5869 had seen 7200-4 [it]: and, behold, the half 2677 was not told 5046-90 me: thy wisdom 2451 and prosperity 2896 exceedeth 3254-52 the fame 8052 which I heard. 8085-1

10:8 Happy 835 [are] thy men, 582 happy 835 [are] these thy servants, 5650 which stand 5975-6 continually 8548 before 6440 thee, [and] that hear 8085-6 thy wisdom. 2451

10:9 Blessed 1288-7 be the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 which delighted 2654-1 in thee, to set 5414-2 thee on the throne 3678 of Israel: 3478 because the LORD 3068 loved 160 Israel 3478 for ever, 5769 therefore made 7760-4 he thee king, 4428 to do 6213-2 judgment 4941 and justice. 6666

10:10 And she gave 5414-4 the king 4428 an hundred 3967 and twenty 6242 talents 3603 of gold, 2091 and of spices 1314 very 3966 great store, 7235-53 and precious 3368 stones: 68 there came 935-1 no more such 1931 abundance 7230 of spices 1314 as these which the queen 4436 of Sheba 7614 gave 5414-1 to king 4428 Solomon. 8010

10:11 And the navy 590 also of Hiram, 2438 that brought 5375-1 gold 2091 from Ophir, 211 brought in 935-52 from Ophir 211 great 3966 plenty 7235-53 of almug 484 trees, 6086 and precious 3368 stones. 68

10:12 And the king 4428 made 6213-4 of the almug 484 trees 6086 pillars 4552 for the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and for the king's 4428 house, 1004 harps 3658 also and psalteries 5035 for singers: 7891-6 there came 935-1 no such almug 484 trees, 6086 nor were seen 7200-8 unto this day. 3117

10:13 And king 4428 Solomon 8010 gave 5414-1 unto the queen 4436 of Sheba 7614 all her desire, 2656 whatsoever she asked, 7592-1 beside [that] which Solomon 8010 gave 5414-1 her of his royal 4428 bounty. 3027 So she turned 6437-4 and went 3212-4 to her own country, 776 she and her servants. 5650

10:14 Now the weight 4948 of gold 2091 that came 935-1 to Solomon 8010 in one 259 year 8141 was six 8337 hundred 3967 threescore 8346 and six 8337 talents 3603 of gold, 2091

10:15 Beside [that he had] of the merchantmen, 582 8446-6 and of the traffick 4536 of the spice merchants, 7402-6 and of all the kings 4428 of Arabia, 6153 and of the governors 6346 of the country. 776

10:16 And king 4428 Solomon 8010 made 6213-4 two hundred 3967 targets 6793 [of] beaten 7820-7 gold: 2091 six 8337 hundred 3967 [shekels] of gold 2091 went 5927-55 to one 259 target. 6793

10:17 And [he made] three 7969 hundred 3967 shields 4043 [of] beaten 7820-7 gold; 2091 three 7969 pound 4488 of gold 2091 went 5927-55 to one 259 shield: 4043 and the king 4428 put 5414-4 them in the house 1004 of the forest 3293 of Lebanon. 3844

10:18 Moreover the king 4428 made 6213-4 a great 1419 throne 3678 of ivory, 8127 and overlaid 6823-17 it with the best 6338-94 gold. 2091

10:19 The throne 3678 had six 8337 steps, 4609 and the top 7218 of the throne 3678 [was] round 5696 behind: 310 and [there were] stays 3027 on either side on the place 4725 of the seat, 7675-2 and two 8147 lions 738 stood 5975-6 beside 681 the stays. 3027

10:20 And twelve 8147 6240 lions 738 stood 5975-6 there on the one side and on the other upon the six 8337 steps: 4609 there was not the like 3651 made 6213-8 in any kingdom. 4467

10:21 And all king 4428 Solomon's 8010 drinking 4945 vessels 3627 [were of] gold, 2091 and all the vessels 3627 of the house 1004 of the forest 3293 of Lebanon 3844 [were of] pure 5462-7 gold; 2091 none 369 [were of] silver: 3701 it was nothing 3808 3972 accounted 2803-12 of in the days 3117 of Solomon. 8010

10:22 For the king 4428 had at sea 3220 a navy 590 of Tharshish 8659 with the navy 590 of Hiram: 2438 once 259 in three 7969 years 8141 came 935-4 the navy 590 of Tharshish, 8659 bringing 5375-6 gold, 2091 and silver, 3701 ivory, 8143 and apes, 6971 and peacocks. 8500

10:23 So king 4428 Solomon 8010 exceeded 1431-4 all the kings 4428 of the earth 776 for riches 6239 and for wisdom. 2451

10:24 And all the earth 776 sought 1245-18 to 6440 Solomon, 8010 to hear 8085-2 his wisdom, 2451 which God 430 had put 5414-1 in his heart. 3820

10:25 And they brought 935-56 every man 376 his present, 4503 vessels 3627 of silver, 3701 and vessels 3627 of gold, 2091 and garments, 8008 and armour, 5402 and spices, 1314 horses, 5483 and mules, 6505 a rate 1697 year 8141 by year. 8141

10:26 And Solomon 8010 gathered 622-4 together chariots 7393 and horsemen: 6571 and he had a thousand 505 and four 702 hundred 3967 chariots, 7393 and twelve 8147 6240 thousand 505 horsemen, 6571 whom he bestowed 5148-55 in the cities 5892 for chariots, 7393 and with the king 4428 at Jerusalem. 3389

10:27 And the king 4428 made 5414-4 silver 3701 [to be] in Jerusalem 3389 as stones, 68 and cedars 730 made 5414-1 he [to be] as the sycomore trees 8256 that [are] in the vale, 8219 for abundance. 7230

10:28 And Solomon 8010 had horses 5483 brought out 4161 of Egypt, 4714 and linen yarn: 4723 the king's 4428 merchants 5503-6 received 3947-4 the linen yarn 4723 at a price. 4242

10:29 And a chariot 4818 came up 5927-4 and went out 3318-4 of Egypt 4714 for six 8337 hundred 3967 [shekels] of silver, 3701 and an horse 5483 for an hundred 3967 and fifty: 2572 and so for all the kings 4428 of the Hittites, 2850 and for the kings 4428 of Syria, 758 did they bring [them] out 3318-55 by their means. 3027

11:1 But king 4428 Solomon 8010 loved 157-1 many 7227 strange 5237 women, 802 together with the daughter 1323 of Pharaoh, 6547 women of the Moabites, 4125 Ammonites, 5984 Edomites, 130 Zidonians, 6722 [and] Hittites; 2850

11:2 Of the nations 1471 [concerning] which the LORD 3068 said 559-1 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 Ye shall not go in 935-4 to them, neither shall they come in 935-4 unto you: [for] surely 403 they will turn away 5186-55 your heart 3824 after 310 their gods: 430 Solomon 8010 clave 1692-1 unto these in love. 157-2

11:3 And he had seven 7651 hundred 3967 wives, 802 princesses, 8282 and three 7969 hundred 3967 concubines: 6370 and his wives 802 turned away 5186-55 his heart. 3820

11:4 For it came to pass, when 6256 Solomon 8010 was old, 2209 [that] his wives 802 turned away 5186-52 his heart 3824 after 310 other 312 gods: 430 and his heart 3824 was not perfect 8003 with the LORD 3068 his God, 430 as [was] the heart 3824 of David 1732 his father. 1

11:5 For Solomon 8010 went 3212-4 after 310 Ashtoreth 6253 the goddess 430 of the Zidonians, 6722 and after 310 Milcom 4445 the abomination 8251 of the Ammonites. 5984

11:6 And Solomon 8010 did 6213-4 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 and went not fully 4390-14 after 310 the LORD, 3068 as [did] David 1732 his father. 1

11:7 Then did Solomon 8010 build 1129-4 an high place 1116 for Chemosh, 3645 the abomination 8251 of Moab, 4124 in the hill 2022 that [is] before 6440 Jerusalem, 3389 and for Molech, 4432 the abomination 8251 of the children 1121 of Ammon. 5983

11:8 And likewise did 6213-1 he for all his strange 5237 wives, 802 which burnt incense 6999-56 and sacrificed 2076-18 unto their gods. 430

11:9 And the LORD 3068 was angry 599-101 with Solomon, 8010 because his heart 3824 was turned 5186-1 from the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 which had appeared 7200-8 unto him twice, 6471

11:10 And had commanded 6680-14 him concerning this thing, 1697 that he should not go 3212-2 after 310 other 312 gods: 430 but he kept 8104-1 not that which the LORD 3068 commanded. 6680-14

11:11 Wherefore the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Solomon, 8010 Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept 8104-1 my covenant 1285 and my statutes, 2708 which I have commanded 6680-14 thee, I will surely 7167-2 rend 7167-4 the kingdom 4467 from thee, and will give 5414-1 it to thy servant. 5650

11:12 Notwithstanding in thy days 3117 I will not do 6213-4 it for David 1732 thy father's 1 sake: [but] I will rend 7167-4 it out of the hand 3027 of thy son. 1121

11:13 Howbeit 7535 I will not rend 7167-4 away all the kingdom; 4467 [but] will give 5414-4 one 259 tribe 7626 to thy son 1121 for David 1732 my servant's 5650 sake, and for Jerusalem's 3389 sake which I have chosen. 977-1

11:14 And the LORD 3068 stirred up 6965-55 an adversary 7854 unto Solomon, 8010 Hadad 1908 the Edomite: 130 he [was] of the king's 4428 seed 2233 in Edom. 123

11:15 For it came to pass, when David 1732 was in Edom, 123 and Joab 3097 the captain 8269 of the host 6635 was gone up 5927-2 to bury 6912-15 the slain, 2491 after he had smitten 5221-55 every male 2145 in Edom; 123

11:16 (For six 8337 months 2320 did Joab 3097 remain 3427-1 there with all Israel, 3478 until he had cut off 3772-52 every male 2145 in Edom:) 123

11:17 That Hadad 111 fled, 1272-4 he and certain 582 Edomites 130 of his father's 1 servants 5650 with him, to go into 935-2 Egypt; 4714 Hadad 1908 [being] yet a little 6996 child. 5288

11:18 And they arose 6965-4 out of Midian, 4080 and came 935-4 to Paran: 6290 and they took 3947-4 men 582 with them out of Paran, 6290 and they came 935-4 to Egypt, 4714 unto Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt; 4714 which gave 5414-4 him an house, 1004 and appointed 559-1 him victuals, 3899 and gave 5414-1 him land. 776

11:19 And Hadad 1908 found 4672-4 great 3966 favour 2580 in the sight 5869 of Pharaoh, 6547 so that he gave 5414-4 him to wife 802 the sister 269 of his own wife, 802 the sister 269 of Tahpenes 8472 the queen. 1377

11:20 And the sister 269 of Tahpenes 8472 bare 3205-4 him Genubath 1592 his son, 1121 whom Tahpenes 8472 weaned 1580-4 in 8432 Pharaoh's 6547 house: 1004 and Genubath 1592 was in Pharaoh's 6547 household 1004 among 8432 the sons 1121 of Pharaoh. 6547

11:21 And when Hadad 1908 heard 8085-1 in Egypt 4714 that David 1732 slept 7901-1 with his fathers, 1 and that Joab 3097 the captain 8269 of the host 6635 was dead, 4191-1 Hadad 1908 said 559-4 to Pharaoh, 6547 Let me depart, 7971-16 that I may go 3212-4 to mine own country. 776

11:22 Then Pharaoh 6547 said 559-4 unto him, But what hast thou lacked 2638 with me, that, behold, thou seekest 1245-18 to go 3212-2 to thine own country? 776 And he answered, 559-4 Nothing: howbeit let me go 7971-17 in any wise. 7971-15

11:23 And God 430 stirred him up 6965-55 [another] adversary, 7854 Rezon 7331 the son 1121 of Eliadah, 450 which fled 1272-1 from his lord 113 Hadadezer 1909 king 4428 of Zobah: 6678

11:24 And he gathered 6908-4 men 582 unto him, and became captain 8269 over a band, 1416 when David 1732 slew 2026-2 them [of Zobah]: and they went 3212-4 to Damascus, 1834 and dwelt 3427-4 therein, and reigned 4427-4 in Damascus. 1834

11:25 And he was an adversary 7854 to Israel 3478 all the days 3117 of Solomon, 8010 beside the mischief 7451 that Hadad 1908 [did]: and he abhorred 6973-4 Israel, 3478 and reigned 4427-4 over Syria. 758

11:26 And Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 an Ephrathite 673 of Zereda, 6868 Solomon's 8010 servant, 5650 whose mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Zeruah, 6871 a widow 490 woman, 802 even he lifted up 7311-55 [his] hand 3027 against the king. 4428

11:27 And this [was] the cause 1697 that he lifted up 7311-52 [his] hand 3027 against the king: 4428 Solomon 8010 built 1129-1 Millo, 4407 [and] repaired 5462-1 the breaches 6556 of the city 5892 of David 1732 his father. 1

11:28 And the man 376 Jeroboam 3379 [was] a mighty 1368 man of valour: 2428 and Solomon 8010 seeing 7200-4 the young man 5288 that he was industrious, 6213-6 4399 he made him ruler 6485-55 over all the charge 5447 of the house 1004 of Joseph. 3130

11:29 And it came to pass at that time 6256 when Jeroboam 3379 went out 3318-1 of Jerusalem, 3389 that the prophet 5030 Ahijah 281 the Shilonite 7888 found 4672-4 him in the way; 1870 and he had clad 3680-102 himself with a new 2319 garment; 8008 and they two 8147 [were] alone in the field: 7704

11:30 And Ahijah 281 caught 8610-4 the new 2319 garment 8008 that [was] on him, and rent 7167-4 it [in] twelve 8147 6240 pieces: 7168

11:31 And he said 559-4 to Jeroboam, 3379 Take 3947-3 thee ten 6235 pieces: 7168 for thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 the God 430 of Israel, 3478 Behold, I will rend 7167-6 the kingdom 4467 out of the hand 3027 of Solomon, 8010 and will give 5414-1 ten 6235 tribes 7626 to thee:

11:32 (But he shall have one 259 tribe 7626 for my servant 5650 David's 1732 sake, and for Jerusalem's 3389 sake, the city 5892 which I have chosen 977-1 out of all the tribes 7626 of Israel:) 3478

11:33 Because that they have forsaken 5800-1 me, and have worshipped 7812-101 Ashtoreth 6253 the goddess 430 of the Zidonians, 6722 Chemosh 3645 the god 430 of the Moabites, 4124 and Milcom 4445 the god 430 of the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 and have not walked 1980-1 in my ways, 1870 to do 6213-2 [that which is] right 3477 in mine eyes, 5869 and [to keep] my statutes 2708 and my judgments, 4941 as [did] David 1732 his father. 1

11:34 Howbeit I will not take 3947-4 the whole kingdom 4467 out of his hand: 3027 but I will make 7896-4 him prince 5387 all the days 3117 of his life 2416 for David 1732 my servant's 5650 sake, whom I chose, 977-1 because he kept 8104-1 my commandments 4687 and my statutes: 2708

11:35 But I will take 3947-1 the kingdom 4410 out of his son's 1121 hand, 3027 and will give 5414-1 it unto thee, [even] ten 6235 tribes. 7626

11:36 And unto his son 1121 will I give 5414-4 one 259 tribe, 7626 that David 1732 my servant 5650 may have a light 5216 alway 3605 3117 before 6440 me in Jerusalem, 3389 the city 5892 which I have chosen 977-1 me to put 7760-2 my name 8034 there.

11:37 And I will take 3947-4 thee, and thou shalt reign 4427-1 according to all that thy soul 5315 desireth, 183-17 and shalt be king 4428 over Israel. 3478

11:38 And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken 8085-4 unto all that I command 6680-17 thee, and wilt walk 1980-1 in my ways, 1870 and do 6213-1 [that is] right 3477 in my sight, 5869 to keep 8104-2 my statutes 2708 and my commandments, 4687 as David 1732 my servant 5650 did; 6213-1 that I will be with thee, and build 1129-1 thee a sure 539-12 house, 1004 as I built 1129-1 for David, 1732 and will give 5414-1 Israel 3478 unto thee.

11:39 And I will for this afflict 6031-17 the seed 2233 of David, 1732 but not for ever. 3605 3117

11:40 Solomon 8010 sought 1245-17 therefore to kill 4191-53 Jeroboam. 3379 And Jeroboam 3379 arose, 6965-4 and fled 1272-4 into Egypt, 4714 unto Shishak 7895 king 4428 of Egypt, 4714 and was in Egypt 4714 until the death 4194 of Solomon. 8010

11:41 And the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Solomon, 8010 and all that he did, 6213-1 and his wisdom, 2451 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the acts 1697 of Solomon? 8010

11:42 And the time 3117 that Solomon 8010 reigned 4427-1 in Jerusalem 3389 over all Israel 3478 [was] forty 705 years. 8141

11:43 And Solomon 8010 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and was buried 6912-11 in the city 5892 of David 1732 his father: 1 and Rehoboam 7346 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

12:1 And Rehoboam 7346 went 3212-4 to Shechem: 7927 for all Israel 3478 were come 935-1 to Shechem 7927 to make him king. 4427-53

12:2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 who was yet in Egypt, 4714 heard 8085-2 [of it], (for he was fled 1272-1 from the presence 6440 of king 4428 Solomon, 8010 and Jeroboam 3379 dwelt 3427-4 in Egypt;) 4714

12:3 That they sent 7971-4 and called 7121-4 him. And Jeroboam 3379 and all the congregation 6951 of Israel 3478 came, 935-4 and spake 1696-17 unto Rehoboam, 7346 saying, 559-2

12:4 Thy father 1 made our yoke 5923 grievous: 7185-52 now therefore make thou the grievous 7186 service 5656 of thy father, 1 and his heavy 3515 yoke 5923 which he put 5414-1 upon us, lighter, 7043-54 5656 and we will serve 5647-4 thee.

12:5 And he said 559-4 unto them, Depart 3212-3 yet [for] three 7969 days, 3117 then come again 7725-3 to me. And the people 5971 departed. 3212-4

12:6 And king 4428 Rehoboam 7346 consulted 3289-11 with the old men, 2205 that stood 5975-6 before 6440 Solomon 8010 his father 1 while he yet lived, 2416 and said, 559-2 How do ye advise 3289-12 that I may 7725-53 answer 1697 this people? 5971

12:7 And they spake 1696-17 unto him, saying, 559-2 If thou wilt be a servant 5650 unto this people 5971 this day, 3117 and wilt serve 5647-1 them, and answer 6030-1 them, and speak 1696-14 good 2896 words 1697 to them, then they will be thy servants 5650 for ever. 3605 3117

12:8 But he forsook 5800-4 the counsel 6098 of the old men, 2205 which they had given 3289-1 him, and consulted 3289-11 with the young men 3206 that were grown up 1431-1 with him, [and] which stood 5975-6 before 6440 him:

12:9 And he said 559-4 unto them, What counsel give 3289-12 ye that we may 7725-55 answer 1697 this people, 5971 who have spoken 1696-14 to me, saying, 559-2 Make the yoke 5923 which thy father 1 did put 5414-1 upon us lighter? 7043-54

12:10 And the young men 3206 that were grown up 1431-1 with him spake 1696-17 unto him, saying, 559-2 Thus shalt thou speak 559-4 unto this people 5971 that spake 1696-14 unto thee, saying, 559-2 Thy father 1 made our yoke 5923 heavy, 3513-52 but make thou [it] lighter 7043-54 unto us; thus shalt thou say 1696-17 unto them, My little 6995 [finger] shall be thicker 5666-1 than my father's 1 loins. 4975

12:11 And now whereas my father 1 did lade 6006-52 you with a heavy 3515 yoke, 5923 I will add 3254-55 to your yoke: 5923 my father 1 hath chastised 3256-14 you with whips, 7752 but I will chastise 3256-17 you with scorpions. 6137

12:12 So Jeroboam 3379 and all the people 5971 came 935-4 to Rehoboam 7346 the third 7992 day, 3117 as the king 4428 had appointed, 1696-14 saying, 559-2 Come to me again 7725-3 the third 7992 day. 3117

12:13 And the king 4428 answered 6030-4 the people 5971 roughly, 7186 and forsook 5800-4 the old men's 2205 counsel 6098 that they gave 3289-1 him;

12:14 And spake 1696-17 to them after the counsel 6098 of the young men, 3206 saying, 559-2 My father 1 made your yoke 5923 heavy, 3513-52 and I will add 3254-55 to your yoke: 5923 my father 1 [also] chastised 3256-14 you with whips, 7752 but I will chastise 3256-17 you with scorpions. 6137

12:15 Wherefore the king 4428 hearkened 8085-1 not unto the people; 5971 for the cause 5438 was from the LORD, 3068 that he might perform 6965-53 his saying, 1697 which the LORD 3068 spake 1696-14 by 3027 Ahijah 281 the Shilonite 7888 unto Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat. 5028

12:16 So when all Israel 3478 saw 7200-4 that the king 4428 hearkened 8085-1 not unto them, the people 5971 answered 7725-55 1697 the king, 4428 saying, 559-2 What portion 2506 have we in David? 1732 neither [have we] inheritance 5159 in the son 1121 of Jesse: 3448 to your tents, 168 O Israel: 3478 now see 7200-3 to thine own house, 1004 David. 1732 So Israel 3478 departed 3212-4 unto their tents. 168

12:17 But [as for] the children 1121 of Israel 3478 which dwelt 3427-6 in the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 Rehoboam 7346 reigned 4427-4 over them.

12:18 Then king 4428 Rehoboam 7346 sent 7971-4 Adoram, 151 who [was] over the tribute; 4522 and all Israel 3478 stoned 7275-4 him with stones, 68 that he died. 4191-4 Therefore king 4428 Rehoboam 7346 made speed 553-98 to get him up 5927-2 to his chariot, 4818 to flee 5127-2 to Jerusalem. 3389

12:19 So Israel 3478 rebelled 6586-4 against the house 1004 of David 1732 unto this day. 3117

12:20 And it came to pass, when all Israel 3478 heard 8085-2 that Jeroboam 3379 was come again, 7725-1 that they sent 7971-4 and called 7121-4 him unto the congregation, 5712 and made him king 4427-55 over all Israel: 3478 there was none that followed 310 the house 1004 of David, 1732 but 2108 the tribe 7626 of Judah 3063 only.

12:21 And when Rehoboam 7346 was come 935-4 to Jerusalem, 3389 he assembled 6950-55 all the house 1004 of Judah, 3063 with the tribe 7626 of Benjamin, 1144 an hundred 3967 and fourscore 8084 thousand 505 chosen men, 977-7 which were warriors, 6213-6 4421 to fight 3898-9 against the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 to bring the kingdom 4410 again 7725-53 to Rehoboam 7346 the son 1121 of Solomon. 8010

12:22 But the word 1697 of God 430 came unto Shemaiah 8098 the man 376 of God, 430 saying, 559-2

12:23 Speak 559-3 unto Rehoboam, 7346 the son 1121 of Solomon, 8010 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and unto all the house 1004 of Judah 3063 and Benjamin, 1144 and to the remnant 3499 of the people, 5971 saying, 559-2

12:24 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Ye shall not go up, 5927-4 nor fight 3898-11 against your brethren 251 the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 return 7725-3 every man 376 to his house; 1004 for this thing 1697 is 1961-8 from me. They hearkened 8085-4 therefore to the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 and returned 7725-4 to depart, 3212-2 according to the word 1697 of the LORD. 3068

12:25 Then Jeroboam 3379 built 1129-4 Shechem 7927 in mount 2022 Ephraim, 669 and dwelt 3427-4 therein; and went out 3318-4 from thence, and built 1129-4 Penuel. 6439

12:26 And Jeroboam 3379 said 559-4 in his heart, 3820 Now shall the kingdom 4467 return 7725-4 to the house 1004 of David: 1732

12:27 If this people 5971 go up 5927-4 to do 6213-2 sacrifice 2077 in the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 at Jerusalem, 3389 then shall the heart 3820 of this people 5971 turn again 7725-1 unto their lord, 113 [even] unto Rehoboam 7346 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and they shall kill 2026-1 me, and go again 7725-1 to Rehoboam 7346 king 4428 of Judah. 3063

12:28 Whereupon the king 4428 took counsel, 3289-11 and made 6213-4 two 8147 calves 5695 [of] gold, 2091 and said 559-4 unto them, It is too much 7227 for you to go up 5927-2 to Jerusalem: 3389 behold thy gods, 430 O Israel, 3478 which brought thee up 5927-52 out of the land 776 of Egypt. 4714

12:29 And he set 7760-4 the one 259 in Bethel, 1008 and the other 259 put 5414-1 he in Dan. 1835

12:30 And this thing 1697 became a sin: 2403 for the people 5971 went 3212-4 [to worship] before 6440 the one, 259 [even] unto Dan. 1835

12:31 And he made 6213-4 an house 1004 of high places, 1116 and made 6213-4 priests 3548 of the lowest 7098 of the people, 5971 which were not of the sons 1121 of Levi. 3878

12:32 And Jeroboam 3379 ordained 6213-4 a feast 2282 in the eighth 8066 month, 2320 on the fifteenth 2568 6240 day 3117 of the month, 2320 like unto the feast 2282 that [is] in Judah, 3063 and he offered 5927-55 upon the altar. 4196 So did 6213-1 he in Bethel, 1008 sacrificing 2076-15 unto the calves 5695 that he had made: 6213-1 and he placed 5975-52 in Bethel 1008 the priests 3548 of the high places 1116 which he had made. 6213-1

12:33 So he offered 5927-55 upon the altar 4196 which he had made 6213-1 in Bethel 1008 the fifteenth 2568 6240 day 3117 of the eighth 8066 month, 2320 [even] in the month 2320 which he had devised 908-1 of his own heart; 3820 and ordained 6213-4 a feast 2282 unto the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 and he offered 5927-55 upon the altar, 4196 and burnt incense. 6999-53

13:1 And, behold, there came 935-1 a man 376 of God 430 out of Judah 3063 by the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 unto Bethel: 1008 and Jeroboam 3379 stood 5975-6 by the altar 4196 to burn incense. 6999-53

13:2 And he cried 7121-4 against the altar 4196 in the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 O altar, 4196 altar, 4196 thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Behold, a child 1121 shall be born 3205-12 unto the house 1004 of David, 1732 Josiah 2977 by name; 8034 and upon thee shall he offer 2076-1 the priests 3548 of the high places 1116 that burn incense 6999-56 upon thee, and men's 120 bones 6106 shall be burnt 8313-4 upon thee.

13:3 And he gave 5414-1 a sign 4159 the same day, 3117 saying, 559-2 This [is] the sign 4159 which the LORD 3068 hath spoken; 1696-14 Behold, the altar 4196 shall be rent, 7167-8 and the ashes 1880 that [are] upon it shall be poured out. 8210-8

13:4 And it came to pass, when king 4428 Jeroboam 3379 heard 8085-2 the saying 1697 of the man 376 of God, 430 which had cried 7121-1 against the altar 4196 in Bethel, 1008 that he put forth 7971-4 his hand 3027 from the altar, 4196 saying, 559-2 Lay hold 8610-3 on him. And his hand, 3027 which he put forth 7971-1 against him, dried up, 3001-4 so that he could 3201-1 not pull it in again 7725-53 to him.

13:5 The altar 4196 also was rent, 7167-8 and the ashes 1880 poured out 8210-11 from the altar, 4196 according to the sign 4159 which the man 376 of God 430 had given 5414-1 by the word 1697 of the LORD. 3068

13:6 And the king 4428 answered 6030-4 and said 559-4 unto the man 376 of God, 430 Intreat 2470-16 now the face 6440 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and pray 6419-100 for me, that my hand 3027 may be restored me again. 7725-4 And the man 376 of God 430 besought 2470-17 6440 the LORD, 3068 and the king's 4428 hand 3027 was restored him again, 7725-4 and became as [it was] before. 7223

13:7 And the king 4428 said 1696-17 unto the man 376 of God, 430 Come 935-3 home 1004 with me, and refresh 5582-3 thyself, and I will give 5414-4 thee a reward. 4991

13:8 And the man 376 of God 430 said 559-4 unto the king, 4428 If thou wilt give 5414-4 me half 2677 thine house, 1004 I will not go in 935-4 with thee, neither will I eat 398-4 bread 3899 nor drink 8354-4 water 4325 in this place: 4725

13:9 For so was it charged 6680-14 me by the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 Eat 398-4 no bread, 3899 nor drink 8354-4 water, 4325 nor turn again 7725-4 by the same way 1870 that thou camest. 1980-1

13:10 So he went 3212-4 another 312 way, 1870 and returned 7725-1 not by the way 1870 that he came 935-1 to Bethel. 1008

13:11 Now there dwelt 3427-6 an 259 old 2205 prophet 5030 in Bethel; 1008 and his sons 1121 came 935-4 and told 5608-17 him all the works 4639 that the man 376 of God 430 had done 6213-1 that day 3117 in Bethel: 1008 the words 1697 which he had spoken 1696-14 unto the king, 4428 them they told 5608-17 also to their father. 1

13:12 And their father 1 said 1696-17 unto them, What way 1870 went 1980-1 he? For his sons 1121 had seen 7200-4 what 335 way 1870 the man 376 of God 430 went, 1980-1 which came 935-1 from Judah. 3063

13:13 And he said 559-4 unto his sons, 1121 Saddle 2280-3 me the ass. 2543 So they saddled 2280-4 him the ass: 2543 and he rode 7392-4 thereon,

13:14 And went 3212-4 after 310 the man 376 of God, 430 and found 4672-4 him sitting 3427-6 under an oak: 424 and he said 559-4 unto him, [Art] thou the man 376 of God 430 that camest 935-1 from Judah? 3063 And he said, 559-4 I [am].

13:15 Then he said 559-4 unto him, Come 3212-3 home 1004 with me, and eat 398-3 bread. 3899

13:16 And he said, 559-4 I may 3201-4 not return 7725-2 with thee, nor go in 935-2 with thee: neither will I eat 398-4 bread 3899 nor drink 8354-4 water 4325 with thee in this place: 4725

13:17 For it was said 1697 to me by the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 Thou shalt eat 398-4 no bread 3899 nor drink 8354-4 water 4325 there, nor turn again 7725-4 to go 3212-2 by the way 1870 that thou camest. 1980-1

13:18 He said 559-4 unto him, I [am] a prophet 5030 also as thou [art]; and an angel 4397 spake 1696-14 unto me by the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 Bring him back 7725-54 with thee into thine house, 1004 that he may eat 398-4 bread 3899 and drink 8354-4 water. 4325 [But] he lied 3584-14 unto him.

13:19 So he went back 7725-4 with him, and did eat 398-4 bread 3899 in his house, 1004 and drank 8354-4 water. 4325

13:20 And it came to pass, as they sat 3427-6 at the table, 7979 that the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto the prophet 5030 that brought him back: 7725-52

13:21 And he cried 7121-4 unto the man 376 of God 430 that came 935-1 from Judah, 3063 saying, 559-2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Forasmuch as 3282 thou hast disobeyed 4784-1 the mouth 6310 of the LORD, 3068 and hast not kept 8104-1 the commandment 4687 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 commanded 6680-14 thee,

13:22 But camest back, 7725-4 and hast eaten 398-4 bread 3899 and drunk 8354-4 water 4325 in the place, 4725 of the which [the LORD] did say 1696-14 to thee, Eat 398-4 no bread, 3899 and drink 8354-4 no water; 4325 thy carcase 5038 shall not come 935-4 unto the sepulchre 6913 of thy fathers. 1

13:23 And it came to pass, after 310 he had eaten 398-2 bread, 3899 and after 310 he had drunk, 8354-2 that he saddled 2280-4 for him the ass, 2543 [to wit], for the prophet 5030 whom he had brought back. 7725-52

13:24 And when he was gone, 3212-4 a lion 738 met 4672-4 him by the way, 1870 and slew 4191-55 him: and his carcase 5038 was cast 7993-94 in the way, 1870 and the ass 2543 stood 5975-6 by 681 it, the lion 738 also stood 5975-6 by the carcase. 5038

13:25 And, behold, men 582 passed by, 5674-6 and saw 7200-4 the carcase 5038 cast 7993-94 in the way, 1870 and the lion 738 standing 5975-6 by 681 the carcase: 5038 and they came 935-4 and told 1696-17 [it] in the city 5892 where the old 2205 prophet 5030 dwelt. 3427-6

13:26 And when the prophet 5030 that brought him back 7725-52 from the way 1870 heard 8085-4 [thereof], he said, 559-4 It [is] the man 376 of God, 430 who was disobedient 4784-1 unto the word 6310 of the LORD: 3068 therefore the LORD 3068 hath delivered 5414-4 him unto the lion, 738 which hath torn 7665-4 him, and slain 4191-55 him, according to the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 which he spake 1696-14 unto him.

13:27 And he spake 1696-17 to his sons, 1121 saying, 559-2 Saddle 2280-3 me the ass. 2543 And they saddled 2280-4 [him].

13:28 And he went 3212-4 and found 4672-4 his carcase 5038 cast 7993-94 in the way, 1870 and the ass 2543 and the lion 738 standing 5975-6 by 681 the carcase: 5038 the lion 738 had not eaten 398-1 the carcase, 5038 nor torn 7665-1 the ass. 2543

13:29 And the prophet 5030 took up 5375-4 the carcase 5038 of the man 376 of God, 430 and laid 3240-55 it upon the ass, 2543 and brought it back: 7725-55 and the old 2205 prophet 5030 came 935-4 to the city, 5892 to mourn 5594-2 and to bury 6912-2 him.

13:30 And he laid 3240-55 his carcase 5038 in his own grave; 6913 and they mourned 5594-4 over him, [saying], Alas, 1945 my brother! 251

13:31 And it came to pass, after 310 he had buried 6912-2 him, that he spake 559-4 to his sons, 1121 saying, 559-2 When I am dead, 4191-2 then bury 6912-1 me in the sepulchre 6913 wherein the man 376 of God 430 [is] buried; 6912-7 lay 3240-54 my bones 6106 beside 681 his bones: 6106

13:32 For the saying 1697 which he cried 7121-1 by the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 against the altar 4196 in Bethel, 1008 and against all the houses 1004 of the high places 1116 which [are] in the cities 5892 of Samaria, 8111 shall surely come to pass.

13:33 After 310 this thing 1697 Jeroboam 3379 returned 7725-1 not from his evil 7451 way, 1870 but made 6213-4 again 7725-4 of the lowest 7098 of the people 5971 priests 3548 of the high places: 1116 whosoever would, 2655 he consecrated 4390-17 him, 3027 and he became [one] of the priests 3548 of the high places. 1116

13:34 And this thing 1697 became sin 2403 unto the house 1004 of Jeroboam, 3379 even to cut [it] off, 3582-53 and to destroy 8045-53 [it] from off the face 6440 of the earth. 127

14:1 At that time 6256 Abijah 29 the son 1121 of Jeroboam 3379 fell sick. 2470-1

14:2 And Jeroboam 3379 said 559-4 to his wife, 802 Arise, 6965-3 I pray thee, and disguise 8138-100 thyself, that thou be not known 3045-4 to be the wife 802 of Jeroboam; 3379 and get 1980-1 thee to Shiloh: 7887 behold, there [is] Ahijah 281 the prophet, 5030 which told 1696-14 me that [I should be] king 4428 over this people. 5971

14:3 And take 3947-1 with thee 3027 ten 6235 loaves, 3899 and cracknels, 5350 and a cruse 1228 of honey, 1706 and go 935-1 to him: he shall tell 5046-55 thee what shall become of the child. 5288

14:4 And Jeroboam's 3379 wife 802 did 6213-4 so, and arose, 6965-4 and went 3212-4 to Shiloh, 7887 and came 935-4 to the house 1004 of Ahijah. 281 But Ahijah 281 could 3201-1 not see; 7200-2 for his eyes 5869 were set 6965-1 by reason of his age. 7869

14:5 And the LORD 3068 said 559-1 unto Ahijah, 281 Behold, the wife 802 of Jeroboam 3379 cometh 935-6 to ask 1875-2 a thing 1697 of thee for her son; 1121 for he [is] sick: 2470-6 thus 2090 and thus 2090 shalt thou say 1696-17 unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, 935-2 that she shall feign herself [to be] another 5234-102 [woman].

14:6 And it was [so], when Ahijah 281 heard 8085-2 the sound 6963 of her feet, 7272 as she came in 935-6 at the door, 6607 that he said, 559-4 Come in, 935-3 thou wife 802 of Jeroboam; 3379 why feignest thou thyself [to be] another? 5234-102 for I [am] sent 7971-7 to thee [with] heavy 7186 [tidings].

14:7 Go, 3212-3 tell 559-3 Jeroboam, 3379 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 Forasmuch as 3282 I exalted 7311-52 thee from among 8432 the people, 5971 and made 5414-4 thee prince 5057 over my people 5971 Israel, 3478

14:8 And rent 7167-4 the kingdom 4467 away from the house 1004 of David, 1732 and gave 5414-4 it thee: and [yet] thou hast not been as my servant 5650 David, 1732 who kept 8104-1 my commandments, 4687 and who followed 1980-1 310 me with all his heart, 3824 to do 6213-2 [that] only [which was] right 3477 in mine eyes; 5869

14:9 But hast done 6213-2 evil 7489-55 above all that were before 6440 thee: for thou hast gone 3212-4 and made 6213-4 thee other 312 gods, 430 and molten images, 4541 to provoke me to anger, 3707-53 and hast cast 7993-52 me behind 310 thy back: 1458

14:10 Therefore, behold, I will bring 935-56 evil 7451 upon the house 1004 of Jeroboam, 3379 and will cut off 3772-52 from Jeroboam 3379 him that pisseth 8366-56 against the wall, 7023 [and] him that is shut up 6113-7 and left 5800-7 in Israel, 3478 and will take away 1197-14 the remnant 310 of the house 1004 of Jeroboam, 3379 as a man taketh away 1197-17 dung, 1557 till it be all gone. 8552-2

14:11 Him that dieth 4191-5 of Jeroboam 3379 in the city 5892 shall the dogs 3611 eat; 398-4 and him that dieth 4191-5 in the field 7704 shall the fowls 5775 of the air 8064 eat: 398-4 for the LORD 3068 hath spoken 1696-14 [it].

14:12 Arise 6965-3 thou therefore, get 3212-3 thee to thine own house: 1004 [and] when thy feet 7272 enter 935-2 into the city, 5892 the child 3206 shall die. 4191-1

14:13 And all Israel 3478 shall mourn 5594-1 for him, and bury 6912-1 him: for he only of Jeroboam 3379 shall come 935-4 to the grave, 6913 because in him there is found 4672-8 [some] good 2896 thing 1697 toward the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 in the house 1004 of Jeroboam. 3379

14:14 Moreover the LORD 3068 shall raise him up 6965-52 a king 4428 over Israel, 3478 who shall cut off 3772-55 the house 1004 of Jeroboam 3379 that day: 3117 but what? even now.

14:15 For the LORD 3068 shall smite 5221-52 Israel, 3478 as a reed 7070 is shaken 5110-4 in the water, 4325 and he shall root up 5428-1 Israel 3478 out of this good 2896 land, 127 which he gave 5414-1 to their fathers, 1 and shall scatter 2219-14 them beyond 5676 the river, 5104 because they have made 6213-1 their groves, 842 provoking the LORD 3068 to anger. 3707-56

14:16 And he shall give 5414-4 Israel 3478 up because 1558 of the sins 2403 of Jeroboam, 3379 who did sin, 2398-1 and who made Israel 3478 to sin. 2398-52

14:17 And Jeroboam's 3379 wife 802 arose, 6965-4 and departed, 3212-4 and came 935-4 to Tirzah: 8656 [and] when she came 935-6 to the threshold 5592 of the door, 1004 the child 5288 died; 4191-1

14:18 And they buried 6912-4 him; and all Israel 3478 mourned 5594-4 for him, according to the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 which he spake 1696-14 by the hand 3027 of his servant 5650 Ahijah 281 the prophet. 5030

14:19 And the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Jeroboam, 3379 how he warred, 3898-8 and how he reigned, 4427-1 behold, they [are] written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel. 3478

14:20 And the days 3117 which Jeroboam 3379 reigned 4427-1 [were] two 8147 and twenty 6242 years: 8141 and he slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and Nadab 5070 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

14:21 And Rehoboam 7346 the son 1121 of Solomon 8010 reigned 4427-1 in Judah. 3063 Rehoboam 7346 [was] forty 705 and one 259 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 seventeen 7651 6240 years 8141 in Jerusalem, 3389 the city 5892 which the LORD 3068 did choose 977-1 out of all the tribes 7626 of Israel, 3478 to put 7760-2 his name 8034 there. And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Naamah 5279 an Ammonitess. 5984

14:22 And Judah 3063 did 6213-4 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 and they provoked him to jealousy 7065-17 with their sins 2403 which they had committed, 2398-1 above all that their fathers 1 had done. 6213-1

14:23 For they also built 1129-4 them high places, 1116 and images, 4676 and groves, 842 on every high 1364 hill, 1389 and under every green 7488 tree. 6086

14:24 And there were also sodomites 6945 in the land: 776 [and] they did 6213-1 according to all the abominations 8441 of the nations 1471 which the LORD 3068 cast out 3423-52 before 6440 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

14:25 And it came to pass in the fifth 2549 year 8141 of king 4428 Rehoboam, 7346 [that] Shishak 7895 king 4428 of Egypt 4714 came up 5927-1 against Jerusalem: 3389

14:26 And he took away 3947-4 the treasures 214 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and the treasures 214 of the king's 4428 house; 1004 he even took away 3947-1 all: and he took away 3947-4 all the shields 4043 of gold 2091 which Solomon 8010 had made. 6213-1

14:27 And king 4428 Rehoboam 7346 made 6213-4 in their stead brasen 5178 shields, 4043 and committed 6485-52 [them] unto the hands 3027 of the chief 8269 of the guard, 7323-5 which kept 8104-6 the door 6607 of the king's 4428 house. 1004

14:28 And it was [so], when 1767 the king 4428 went 935-2 into the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 that the guard 7323-5 bare 5375-4 them, and brought them back 7725-52 into the guard 7323-5 chamber. 8372

14:29 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Rehoboam, 7346 and all that he did, 6213-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Judah? 3063

14:30 And there was war 4421 between Rehoboam 7346 and Jeroboam 3379 all [their] days. 3117

14:31 And Rehoboam 7346 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and was buried 6912-11 with his fathers 1 in the city 5892 of David. 1732 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Naamah 5279 an Ammonitess. 5984 And Abijam 38 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

15:1 Now in the eighteenth 8083 6240 year 8141 of king 4428 Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat 5028 reigned 4427-1 Abijam 38 over Judah. 3063

15:2 Three 7969 years 8141 reigned 4427-1 he in Jerusalem. 3389 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Maachah, 4601 the daughter 1323 of Abishalom. 53

15:3 And he walked 3212-4 in all the sins 2403 of his father, 1 which he had done 6213-1 before 6440 him: and his heart 3824 was not perfect 8003 with the LORD 3068 his God, 430 as the heart 3824 of David 1732 his father. 1

15:4 Nevertheless for David's 1732 sake did the LORD 3068 his God 430 give 5414-1 him a lamp 5216 in Jerusalem, 3389 to set up 6965-53 his son 1121 after 310 him, and to establish 5975-53 Jerusalem: 3389

15:5 Because David 1732 did 6213-1 [that which was] right 3477 in the eyes 5869 of the LORD, 3068 and turned not aside 5493-1 from any [thing] that he commanded 6680-14 him all the days 3117 of his life, 2416 save only in the matter 1697 of Uriah 223 the Hittite. 2850

15:6 And there was war 4421 between Rehoboam 7346 and Jeroboam 3379 all the days 3117 of his life. 2416

15:7 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Abijam, 38 and all that he did, 6213-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Judah? 3063 And there was war 4421 between Abijam 38 and Jeroboam. 3379

15:8 And Abijam 38 slept 7901-4 with his fathers; 1 and they buried 6912-4 him in the city 5892 of David: 1732 and Asa 609 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

15:9 And in the twentieth 6242 year 8141 of Jeroboam 3379 king 4428 of Israel 3478 reigned 4427-1 Asa 609 over Judah. 3063

15:10 And forty 705 and one 259 years 8141 reigned 4427-1 he in Jerusalem. 3389 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Maachah, 4601 the daughter 1323 of Abishalom. 53

15:11 And Asa 609 did 6213-4 [that which was] right 3477 in the eyes 5869 of the LORD, 3068 as [did] David 1732 his father. 1

15:12 And he took away 5674-55 the sodomites 6945 out of the land, 776 and removed 5493-55 all the idols 1544 that his fathers 1 had made. 6213-1

15:13 And also Maachah 4601 his mother, 517 even her he removed 5493-55 from [being] queen, 1377 because she had made 6213-1 an idol 4656 in a grove; 842 and Asa 609 destroyed 3772-4 her idol, 4656 and burnt 8313-4 [it] by the brook 5158 Kidron. 6939

15:14 But the high places 1116 were not removed: 5493-1 nevertheless Asa's 609 heart 3824 was perfect 8003 with the LORD 3068 all his days. 3117

15:15 And he brought in 935-55 the things which his father 1 had dedicated, 6944 and the things which himself had dedicated, 6944 into the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 silver, 3701 and gold, 2091 and vessels. 3627

15:16 And there was war 4421 between Asa 609 and Baasha 1201 king 4428 of Israel 3478 all their days. 3117

15:17 And Baasha 1201 king 4428 of Israel 3478 went up 5927-4 against Judah, 3063 and built 1129-4 Ramah, 7414 that he might not suffer 5414-2 any to go out 3318-6 or come in 935-6 to Asa 609 king 4428 of Judah. 3063

15:18 Then Asa 609 took 3947-4 all the silver 3701 and the gold 2091 [that were] left 3498-12 in the treasures 214 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and the treasures 214 of the king's 4428 house, 1004 and delivered 5414-4 them into the hand 3027 of his servants: 5650 and king 4428 Asa 609 sent 7971-4 them to Benhadad, 1130 the son 1121 of Tabrimon, 2886 the son 1121 of Hezion, 2383 king 4428 of Syria, 758 that dwelt 3427-6 at Damascus, 1834 saying, 559-2

15:19 [There is] a league 1285 between me and thee, [and] between my father 1 and thy father: 1 behold, I have sent 7971-1 unto thee a present 7810 of silver 3701 and gold; 2091 come 3212-3 and break 6565-54 thy league 1285 with Baasha 1201 king 4428 of Israel, 3478 that he may depart 5927-4 from me.

15:20 So Benhadad 1130 hearkened 8085-4 unto king 4428 Asa, 609 and sent 7971-4 the captains 8269 of the hosts 2428 which he had against the cities 5892 of Israel, 3478 and smote 5221-55 Ijon, 5859 and Dan, 1835 and Abelbethmaachah, 59|1038|62 and all Cinneroth, 3672 with all the land 776 of Naphtali. 5321

15:21 And it came to pass, when Baasha 1201 heard 8085-2 [thereof], that he left off 2308-4 building 1129-2 of Ramah, 7414 and dwelt 3427-4 in Tirzah. 8656

15:22 Then king 4428 Asa 609 made a proclamation 8085-52 throughout all Judah; 3063 none [was] exempted: 5355 and they took away 5375-4 the stones 68 of Ramah, 7414 and the timber 6086 thereof, wherewith Baasha 1201 had builded; 1129-1 and king 4428 Asa 609 built 1129-4 with them Geba 1387 of Benjamin, 1144 and Mizpah. 4709

15:23 The rest 3499 of all the acts 1697 of Asa, 609 and all his might, 1369 and all that he did, 6213-1 and the cities 5892 which he built, 1129-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Judah? 3063 Nevertheless in the time 6256 of his old age 2209 he was diseased 2470-1 in his feet. 7272

15:24 And Asa 609 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and was buried 6912-11 with his fathers 1 in the city 5892 of David 1732 his father: 1 and Jehoshaphat 3092 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

15:25 And Nadab 5070 the son 1121 of Jeroboam 3379 began to reign 4427-1 over Israel 3478 in the second 8147 year 8141 of Asa 609 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and reigned 4427-4 over Israel 3478 two years. 8141

15:26 And he did 6213-4 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 and walked 3212-4 in the way 1870 of his father, 1 and in his sin 2403 wherewith he made Israel 3478 to sin. 2398-52

15:27 And Baasha 1201 the son 1121 of Ahijah, 281 of the house 1004 of Issachar, 3485 conspired 7194-4 against him; and Baasha 1201 smote 5221-55 him at Gibbethon, 1405 which [belonged] to the Philistines; 6430 for Nadab 5070 and all Israel 3478 laid siege 6696-6 to Gibbethon. 1405

15:28 Even in the third 7969 year 8141 of Asa 609 king 4428 of Judah 3063 did Baasha 1201 slay 4191-55 him, and reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

15:29 And it came to pass, when he reigned, 4427-2 [that] he smote 5221-52 all the house 1004 of Jeroboam; 3379 he left 7604-52 not to Jeroboam 3379 any that breathed, 5397 until he had destroyed 8045-52 him, according unto the saying 1697 of the LORD, 3068 which he spake 1696-14 by 3027 his servant 5650 Ahijah 281 the Shilonite: 7888

15:30 Because of the sins 2403 of Jeroboam 3379 which he sinned, 2398-1 and which he made Israel 3478 sin, 2398-52 by his provocation 3708 wherewith he provoked the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 to anger. 3707-52

15:31 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Nadab, 5070 and all that he did, 6213-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel? 3478

15:32 And there was war 4421 between Asa 609 and Baasha 1201 king 4428 of Israel 3478 all their days. 3117

15:33 In the third 7969 year 8141 of Asa 609 king 4428 of Judah 3063 began Baasha 1201 the son 1121 of Ahijah 281 to reign 4427-1 over all Israel 3478 in Tirzah, 8656 twenty 6242 and four 702 years. 8141

15:34 And he did 6213-4 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 and walked 3212-4 in the way 1870 of Jeroboam, 3379 and in his sin 2403 wherewith he made Israel 3478 to sin. 2398-52

16:1 Then the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came to Jehu 3058 the son 1121 of Hanani 2607 against Baasha, 1201 saying, 559-2

16:2 Forasmuch as I exalted 7311-52 thee out of the dust, 6083 and made 5414-4 thee prince 5057 over my people 5971 Israel; 3478 and thou hast walked 3212-4 in the way 1870 of Jeroboam, 3379 and hast made my people 5971 Israel 3478 to sin, 2398-55 to provoke me to anger 3707-53 with their sins; 2403

16:3 Behold, I will take away 1197-56 the posterity 310 of Baasha, 1201 and the posterity 310 of his house; 1004 and will make 5414-1 thy house 1004 like the house 1004 of Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat. 5028

16:4 Him that dieth 4191-5 of Baasha 1201 in the city 5892 shall the dogs 3611 eat; 398-4 and him that dieth 4191-5 of his in the fields 7704 shall the fowls 5775 of the air 8064 eat. 398-4

16:5 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Baasha, 1201 and what he did, 6213-1 and his might, 1369 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel? 3478

16:6 So Baasha 1201 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and was buried 6912-11 in Tirzah: 8656 and Elah 425 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

16:7 And also by the hand 3027 of the prophet 5030 Jehu 3058 the son 1121 of Hanani 2607 came the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 against Baasha, 1201 and against his house, 1004 even for all the evil 7451 that he did 6213-1 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 in provoking him to anger 3707-53 with the work 4639 of his hands, 3027 in being like the house 1004 of Jeroboam; 3379 and because he killed 5221-52 him.

16:8 In the twenty 6242 8141 and sixth 8337 year 8141 of Asa 609 king 4428 of Judah 3063 began Elah 425 the son 1121 of Baasha 1201 to reign 4427-1 over Israel 3478 in Tirzah, 8656 two years. 8141

16:9 And his servant 5650 Zimri, 2174 captain 8269 of half 4276 [his] chariots, 7393 conspired 7194-4 against him, as he was in Tirzah, 8656 drinking 8354-6 himself drunk 7910 in the house 1004 of Arza 777 steward of [his] house 1004 in Tirzah. 8656

16:10 And Zimri 2174 went in 935-4 and smote 5221-55 him, and killed 4191-55 him, in the twenty 6242 and seventh 7651 year 8141 of Asa 609 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

16:11 And it came to pass, when he began to reign, 4427-2 as soon as he sat 3427-2 on his throne, 3678 [that] he slew 5221-52 all the house 1004 of Baasha: 1201 he left 7604-52 him not one that pisseth 8366-56 against a wall, 7023 neither of his kinsfolks, 1350-6 nor of his friends. 7453

16:12 Thus did Zimri 2174 destroy 8045-55 all the house 1004 of Baasha, 1201 according to the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 which he spake 1696-14 against Baasha 1201 by 3027 Jehu 3058 the prophet, 5030

16:13 For all the sins 2403 of Baasha, 1201 and the sins 2403 of Elah 425 his son, 1121 by which they sinned, 2398-1 and by which they made Israel 3478 to sin, 2398-52 in provoking the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 to anger 3707-53 with their vanities. 1892

16:14 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Elah, 425 and all that he did, 6213-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel? 3478

16:15 In the twenty 6242 8141 and seventh 7651 year 8141 of Asa 609 king 4428 of Judah 3063 did Zimri 2174 reign 4427-1 seven 7651 days 3117 in Tirzah. 8656 And the people 5971 [were] encamped 2583-6 against Gibbethon, 1405 which [belonged] to the Philistines. 6430

16:16 And the people 5971 [that were] encamped 2583-6 heard 8085-4 say, 559-2 Zimri 2174 hath conspired, 7194-1 and hath also slain 5221-52 the king: 4428 wherefore all Israel 3478 made Omri, 6018 the captain 8269 of the host, 6635 king 4427-55 over Israel 3478 that day 3117 in the camp. 4264

16:17 And Omri 6018 went up 5927-4 from Gibbethon, 1405 and all Israel 3478 with him, and they besieged 6696-4 Tirzah. 8656

16:18 And it came to pass, when Zimri 2174 saw 7200-2 that the city 5892 was taken, 3920-8 that he went 935-4 into the palace 759 of the king's 4428 house, 1004 and burnt 8313-4 the king's 4428 house 1004 over him with fire, 784 and died, 4191-4

16:19 For his sins 2403 which he sinned 2398-1 in doing 6213-2 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 in walking 3212-2 in the way 1870 of Jeroboam, 3379 and in his sin 2403 which he did, 6213-1 to make Israel 3478 to sin. 2398-53

16:20 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Zimri, 2174 and his treason 7195 that he wrought, 7194-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel? 3478

16:21 Then were the people 5971 of Israel 3478 divided 2505-11 into two parts: 2677 half 2677 of the people 5971 followed 1961-1 310 Tibni 8402 the son 1121 of Ginath, 1527 to make him king; 4427-53 and half 2677 followed 310 Omri. 6018

16:22 But the people 5971 that followed 310 Omri 6018 prevailed 2388-4 against 854 the people 5971 that followed 310 Tibni 8402 the son 1121 of Ginath: 1527 so Tibni 8402 died, 4191-4 and Omri 6018 reigned. 4427-4

16:23 In the thirty 7970 8141 and first 259 year 8141 of Asa 609 king 4428 of Judah 3063 began Omri 6018 to reign 4427-1 over Israel, 3478 twelve 8147 6240 years: 8141 six 8337 years 8141 reigned 4427-1 he in Tirzah. 8656

16:24 And he bought 7069-4 the hill 2022 Samaria 8111 of Shemer 8106 for two talents 3603 of silver, 3701 and built 1129-4 on the hill, 2022 and called 7121-4 the name 8034 of the city 5892 which he built, 1129-1 after the name 8034 of Shemer, 8106 owner 113 of the hill, 2022 Samaria. 8111

16:25 But Omri 6018 wrought 6213-4 evil 7451 in the eyes 5869 of the LORD, 3068 and did worse 7489-55 than all that [were] before 6440 him.

16:26 For he walked 3212-4 in all the way 1870 of Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 and in his sin 2403 wherewith he made Israel 3478 to sin, 2398-52 to provoke the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 to anger 3707-53 with their vanities. 1892

16:27 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Omri 6018 which he did, 6213-1 and his might 1369 that he shewed, 6213-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel? 3478

16:28 So Omri 6018 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and was buried 6912-11 in Samaria: 8111 and Ahab 256 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

16:29 And in the thirty 7970 8141 and eighth 8083 year 8141 of Asa 609 king 4428 of Judah 3063 began Ahab 256 the son 1121 of Omri 6018 to reign 4427-1 over Israel: 3478 and Ahab 256 the son 1121 of Omri 6018 reigned 4427-4 over Israel 3478 in Samaria 8111 twenty 6242 and two 8147 years. 8141

16:30 And Ahab 256 the son 1121 of Omri 6018 did 6213-4 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD 3068 above all that [were] before 6440 him.

16:31 And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing 7043-8 for him to walk 3212-2 in the sins 2403 of Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 that he took 3947-4 to wife 802 Jezebel 348 the daughter 1323 of Ethbaal 856 king 4428 of the Zidonians, 6722 and went 3212-4 and served 5647-4 Baal, 1168 and worshipped 7812-101 him.

16:32 And he reared up 6965-55 an altar 4196 for Baal 1168 in the house 1004 of Baal, 1168 which he had built 1129-1 in Samaria. 8111

16:33 And Ahab 256 made 6213-4 a grove; 842 and Ahab 256 did 6213-2 more 3254-55 to provoke the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 to anger 3707-53 than all the kings 4428 of Israel 3478 that were before 6440 him.

16:34 In his days 3117 did Hiel 2419 the Bethelite 1017 build 1129-1 Jericho: 3405 he laid the foundation 3245-14 thereof in Abiram 48 his firstborn, 1060 and set up 5324-52 the gates 1817 thereof in his youngest 6810 [son] Segub, 7687 according to the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 which he spake 1696-14 by 3027 Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun. 5126

17:1 And Elijah 452 the Tishbite, 8664 [who was] of the inhabitants 8453 of Gilead, 1568 said 559-4 unto Ahab, 256 [As] the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 liveth, 2416 before 6440 whom I stand, 5975-1 there shall not be dew 2919 nor rain 4306 these years, 8141 but according 6310 to my word. 1697

17:2 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto him, saying, 559-2

17:3 Get 3212-3 thee hence, and turn 6437-1 thee eastward, 6924 and hide 5641-8 thyself by the brook 5158 Cherith, 3747 that [is] before 6440 Jordan. 3383

17:4 And it shall be, [that] thou shalt drink 8354-4 of the brook; 5158 and I have commanded 6680-14 the ravens 6158 to feed 3557-44 thee there.

17:5 So he went 3212-4 and did 6213-4 according unto the word 1697 of the LORD: 3068 for he went 3212-4 and dwelt 3427-4 by the brook 5158 Cherith, 3747 that [is] before 6440 Jordan. 3383

17:6 And the ravens 6158 brought 935-56 him bread 3899 and flesh 1320 in the morning, 1242 and bread 3899 and flesh 1320 in the evening; 6153 and he drank 8354-4 of the brook. 5158

17:7 And it came to pass after 7093 a while, 3117 that the brook 5158 dried up, 3001-4 because there had been no rain 1653 in the land. 776

17:8 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto him, saying, 559-2

17:9 Arise, 6965-3 get 3212-3 thee to Zarephath, 6886 which [belongeth] to Zidon, 6721 and dwell 3427-1 there: behold, I have commanded 6680-14 a widow 490 woman 802 there to sustain 3557-44 thee.

17:10 So he arose 6965-4 and went 3212-4 to Zarephath. 6886 And when he came 935-4 to the gate 6607 of the city, 5892 behold, the widow 490 woman 802 [was] there gathering 7197-26 of sticks: 6086 and he called 7121-4 to her, and said, 559-4 Fetch 3947-3 me, I pray thee, a little 4592 water 4325 in a vessel, 3627 that I may drink. 8354-4

17:11 And as she was going 3212-4 to fetch 3947-2 [it], he called 7121-4 to her, and said, 559-4 Bring 3947-3 me, I pray thee, a morsel 6595 of bread 3899 in thine hand. 3027

17:12 And she said, 559-4 [As] the LORD 3068 thy God 430 liveth, 2416 I have 3426 not a cake, 4580 but an handful 4393 3709 of meal 7058 in a barrel, 3537 and a little 4592 oil 8081 in a cruse: 6835 and, behold, I [am] gathering 7197-26 two 8147 sticks, 6086 that I may go in 935-1 and dress 6213-1 it for me and my son, 1121 that we may eat 398-1 it, and die. 4191-1

17:13 And Elijah 452 said 559-4 unto her, Fear 3372-4 not; go 935-3 [and] do 6213-3 as thou hast said: 1697 but make 6213-3 me thereof 8033 a little 6996 cake 5692 first, 7223 and bring 3318-52 [it] unto me, and after 314 make 6213-4 for thee and for thy son. 1121

17:14 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 The barrel 3537 of meal 7058 shall not waste, 3615-4 neither shall the cruse 6835 of oil 8081 fail, 2637-4 until the day 3117 [that] the LORD 3068 sendeth 5414-2 rain 1653 upon 6440 the earth. 127

17:15 And she went 3212-4 and did 6213-4 according to the saying 1697 of Elijah: 452 and she, and he, and her house, 1004 did eat 398-4 [many] days. 3117

17:16 [And] the barrel 3537 of meal 7058 wasted 3615-1 not, neither did the cruse 6835 of oil 8081 fail, 2638 according to the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 which he spake 1696-14 by 3027 Elijah. 452

17:17 And it came to pass after 310 these things, 1697 [that] the son 1121 of the woman, 802 the mistress 1172 of the house, 1004 fell sick; 2470-1 and his sickness 2483 was so 3966 sore, 2389 that there was no breath 5397 left 3498-8 in him.

17:18 And she said 559-4 unto Elijah, 452 What have I to do with thee, O thou man 376 of God? 430 art thou come 935-1 unto me to call my sin 5771 to remembrance, 2142-53 and to slay 4191-53 my son? 1121

17:19 And he said 559-4 unto her, Give 5414-3 me thy son. 1121 And he took 3947-4 him out of her bosom, 2436 and carried him up 5927-55 into a loft, 5944 where he abode, 3427-6 and laid 7901-55 him upon his own bed. 4296

17:20 And he cried 7121-4 unto the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 O LORD 3068 my God, 430 hast thou also brought evil 7489-52 upon the widow 490 with whom I sojourn, 1481-114 by slaying 4191-53 her son? 1121

17:21 And he stretched 4058-113 himself upon the child 3206 three 7969 times, 6471 and cried 7121-4 unto the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 O LORD 3068 my God, 430 I pray thee, let this child's 3206 soul 5315 come into him 7130 again. 7725-4

17:22 And the LORD 3068 heard 8085-4 the voice 6963 of Elijah; 452 and the soul 5315 of the child 3206 came into him 7130 again, 7725-4 and he revived. 2421-4

17:23 And Elijah 452 took 3947-4 the child, 3206 and brought him down 3381-55 out of the chamber 5944 into the house, 1004 and delivered 5414-4 him unto his mother: 517 and Elijah 452 said, 559-4 See, 7200-3 thy son 1121 liveth. 2416

17:24 And the woman 802 said 559-4 to Elijah, 452 Now by this 2088 I know 3045-1 that thou [art] a man 376 of God, 430 [and] that the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 in thy mouth 6310 [is] truth. 571

18:1 And it came to pass [after] many 7227 days, 3117 that the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came to Elijah 452 in the third 7992 year, 8141 saying, 559-2 Go, 3212-3 shew 7200-10 thyself unto Ahab; 256 and I will send 5414-4 rain 4306 upon 6440 the earth. 127

18:2 And Elijah 452 went 3212-4 to shew 7200-9 himself unto Ahab. 256 And [there was] a sore 2389 famine 7458 in Samaria. 8111

18:3 And Ahab 256 called 7121-4 Obadiah, 5662 which [was] the governor of [his] house. 1004 (Now Obadiah 5662 feared 3373 the LORD 3068 greatly: 3966

18:4 For it was [so], when Jezebel 348 cut off 3772-53 the prophets 5030 of the LORD, 3068 that Obadiah 5662 took 3947-4 an hundred 3967 prophets, 5030 and hid 2244-55 them by fifty 376 2572 in a cave, 4631 and fed 3557-43 them with bread 3899 and water.) 4325

18:5 And Ahab 256 said 559-4 unto Obadiah, 5662 Go 3212-3 into the land, 776 unto all fountains 4599 of water, 4325 and unto all brooks: 5158 peradventure 194 we may find 4672-4 grass 2682 to save the horses 5483 and mules 6505 alive, 2421-17 that we lose 3772-55 not all the beasts. 929

18:6 So they divided 2505-17 the land 776 between them to pass 5674-2 throughout it: Ahab 256 went 1980-1 one 259 way 1870 by himself, and Obadiah 5662 went 1980-1 another 259 way 1870 by himself.

18:7 And as Obadiah 5662 was in the way, 1870 behold, Elijah 452 met 7125-2 him: and he knew 5234-55 him, and fell 5307-4 on his face, 6440 and said, 559-4 [Art] thou that my lord 113 Elijah? 452

18:8 And he answered 559-4 him, I [am]: go, 3212-3 tell 559-3 thy lord, 113 Behold, Elijah 452 [is here].

18:9 And he said, 559-4 What have I sinned, 2398-1 that thou wouldest deliver 5414-6 thy servant 5650 into the hand 3027 of Ahab, 256 to slay 4191-53 me?

18:10 [As] the LORD 3068 thy God 430 liveth, 2416 there is 3426 no nation 1471 or kingdom, 4467 whither 834 my lord 113 hath not sent 7971-1 to seek 1245-15 thee: and when they said, 559-1 [He is] not [there]; he took an oath 7650-52 of the kingdom 4467 and nation, 1471 that they found 4672-4 thee not.

18:11 And now thou sayest, 559-6 Go, 3212-3 tell 559-3 thy lord, 113 Behold, Elijah 452 [is here].

18:12 And it shall come to pass, [as soon as] I am gone 3212-4 from thee, that the Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 shall carry 5375-4 thee whither I know 3045-4 not; and [so] when I come 935-1 and tell 5046-53 Ahab, 256 and he cannot find 4672-4 thee, he shall slay 2026-1 me: but I thy servant 5650 fear 3372-1 the LORD 3068 from my youth. 5271

18:13 Was it not told 5046-90 my lord 113 what I did 6213-1 when Jezebel 348 slew 2026-2 the prophets 5030 of the LORD, 3068 how I hid 2244-55 an hundred 3967 men 376 of the LORD'S 3068 prophets 5030 by fifty 2572 2572 376 in a cave, 4631 and fed 3557-46 them with bread 3899 and water? 4325

18:14 And now thou sayest, 559-6 Go, 3212-3 tell 559-3 thy lord, 113 Behold, Elijah 452 [is here]: and he shall slay 2026-1 me.

18:15 And Elijah 452 said, 559-4 [As] the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 liveth, 2416 before 6440 whom I stand, 5975-1 I will surely shew 7200-11 myself unto him to day. 3117

18:16 So Obadiah 5662 went 3212-4 to meet 7125-2 Ahab, 256 and told 5046-55 him: and Ahab 256 went 3212-4 to meet 7125-2 Elijah. 452

18:17 And it came to pass, when Ahab 256 saw 7200-2 Elijah, 452 that Ahab 256 said 559-4 unto him, [Art] thou he that troubleth 5916-6 Israel? 3478

18:18 And he answered, 559-4 I have not troubled 5916-1 Israel; 3478 but thou, and thy father's 1 house, 1004 in that ye have forsaken 5800-2 the commandments 4687 of the LORD, 3068 and thou hast followed 3212-4 310 Baalim. 1168

18:19 Now therefore send, 7971-3 [and] gather 6908-3 to me all Israel 3478 unto mount 2022 Carmel, 3760 and the prophets 5030 of Baal 1168 four 702 hundred 3967 and fifty, 2572 and the prophets 5030 of the groves 842 four 702 hundred, 3967 which eat 398-6 at Jezebel's 348 table. 7979

18:20 So Ahab 256 sent 7971-4 unto all the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and gathered the prophets 5030 together 6908-4 unto mount 2022 Carmel. 3760

18:21 And Elijah 452 came 5066-4 unto all the people, 5971 and said, 559-4 How long halt 6452-6 ye between 5921 two 8147 opinions? 5587 if the LORD 3068 [be] God, 430 follow 3212-3 310 him: but if Baal, 1168 [then] follow 3212-3 310 him. And the people 5971 answered 6030-1 him not a word. 1697

18:22 Then said 559-4 Elijah 452 unto the people, 5971 I, [even] I only, remain 3498-8 a prophet 5030 of the LORD; 3068 but Baal's 1168 prophets 5030 [are] four 702 hundred 3967 and fifty 2572 men. 376

18:23 Let them therefore give 5414-4 us two 8147 bullocks; 6499 and let them choose 977-4 one 259 bullock 6499 for themselves, and cut it in pieces, 5408-17 and lay 7760-4 [it] on wood, 6086 and put 7760-4 no fire 784 [under]: and I will dress 6213-4 the other 259 bullock, 6499 and lay 5414-1 [it] on wood, 6086 and put 7760-4 no fire 784 [under]:

18:24 And call 7121-1 ye on the name 8034 of your gods, 430 and I will call 7121-4 on the name 8034 of the LORD: 3068 and the God 430 that answereth 6030-4 by fire, 784 let him be God. 430 And all the people 5971 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 It is well 2896 spoken. 1697

18:25 And Elijah 452 said 559-4 unto the prophets 5030 of Baal, 1168 Choose 977-3 you one 259 bullock 6499 for yourselves, and dress 6213-3 [it] first; 7223 for ye [are] many; 7227 and call 7121-3 on the name 8034 of your gods, 430 but put 7760-4 no fire 784 [under].

18:26 And they took 3947-4 the bullock 6499 which was given 5414-1 them, and they dressed 6213-4 [it], and called 7121-4 on the name 8034 of Baal 1168 from morning 1242 even until noon, 6672 saying, 559-2 O Baal, 1168 hear 6030-3 us. But [there was] no 369 voice, 6963 nor any 369 that answered. 6030-6 And they leaped 6452-17 upon the altar 4196 which was made. 6213-1

18:27 And it came to pass at noon, 6672 that Elijah 452 mocked 2048-17 them, and said, 559-4 Cry 7121-3 aloud: 1419 6963 for he [is] a god; 430 either he is talking, 7879 or he is pursuing, 7873 or he is in a journey, 1870 [or] peradventure 194 he sleepeth, 3463 and must be awaked. 3364-4

18:28 And they cried 7121-4 aloud, 6963 1419 and cut 1413-108 themselves after their manner 4941 with knives 2719 and lancets, 7420 till the blood 1818 gushed out 8210-2 upon them.

18:29 And it came to pass, when midday 6672 was past, 5674-2 and they prophesied 5012-101 until the [time] of the offering 5927-2 of the [evening] sacrifice, 4503 that [there was] neither voice, 6963 nor any to answer, 6030-6 nor any that regarded. 7182

18:30 And Elijah 452 said 559-4 unto all the people, 5971 Come near 5066-3 unto me. And all the people 5971 came near 5066-4 unto him. And he repaired 7495-17 the altar 4196 of the LORD 3068 [that was] broken down. 2040-7

18:31 And Elijah 452 took 3947-4 twelve 8147 6240 stones, 68 according to the number 4557 of the tribes 7626 of the sons 1121 of Jacob, 3290 unto whom the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came, saying, 559-2 Israel 3478 shall be thy name: 8034

18:32 And with the stones 68 he built 1129-4 an altar 4196 in the name 8034 of the LORD: 3068 and he made 6213-4 a trench 8585 about 5439 the altar, 4196 as great as would contain 1004 two measures 5429 of seed. 2233

18:33 And he put the wood 6086 in order, 6186-4 and cut the bullock 6499 in pieces, 5408-17 and laid 7760-4 [him] on the wood, 6086 and said, 559-4 Fill 4390-3 four 702 barrels 3537 with water, 4325 and pour 3332-3 [it] on the burnt sacrifice, 5930 and on the wood. 6086

18:34 And he said, 559-4 Do [it] the second time. 8138-3 And they did [it] the second time. 8138-4 And he said, 559-4 Do [it] the third time. 8027-16 And they did [it] the third time. 8027-17

18:35 And the water 4325 ran 3212-4 round about 5439 the altar; 4196 and he filled 4390-14 the trench 8585 also with water. 4325

18:36 And it came to pass at [the time of] the offering 5927-2 of the [evening] sacrifice, 4503 that Elijah 452 the prophet 5030 came near, 5066-4 and said, 559-4 LORD 3068 God 430 of Abraham, 85 Isaac, 3327 and of Israel, 3478 let it be known 3045-11 this day 3117 that thou [art] God 430 in Israel, 3478 and [that] I [am] thy servant, 5650 and [that] I have done 6213-1 all these things 1697 at thy word. 1697

18:37 Hear 6030-3 me, O LORD, 3068 hear 6030-3 me, that this people 5971 may know 3045-4 that thou [art] the LORD 3068 God, 430 and [that] thou hast turned 5437-52 their heart 3820 back again. 322

18:38 Then the fire 784 of the LORD 3068 fell, 5307-4 and consumed 398-4 the burnt sacrifice, 5930 and the wood, 6086 and the stones, 68 and the dust, 6083 and licked up 3897-14 the water 4325 that [was] in the trench. 8585

18:39 And when all the people 5971 saw 7200-4 [it], they fell 5307-4 on their faces: 6440 and they said, 559-4 The LORD, 3068 he [is] the God; 430 the LORD, 3068 he [is] the God. 430

18:40 And Elijah 452 said 559-4 unto them, Take 8610-3 the prophets 5030 of Baal; 1168 let not one 376 of them escape. 4422-11 And they took 8610-4 them: and Elijah 452 brought them down 3381-55 to the brook 5158 Kishon, 7028 and slew 7819-4 them there.

18:41 And Elijah 452 said 559-4 unto Ahab, 256 Get thee up, 5927-3 eat 398-3 and drink; 8354-3 for [there is] a sound 6963 of abundance 1995 of rain. 1653

18:42 So Ahab 256 went up 5927-4 to eat 398-2 and to drink. 8354-2 And Elijah 452 went up 5927-1 to the top 7218 of Carmel; 3760 and he cast himself down 1457-4 upon the earth, 776 and put 7760-4 his face 6440 between his knees, 1290

18:43 And said 559-4 to his servant, 5288 Go up 5927-3 now, look 5027-54 toward 1870 the sea. 3220 And he went up, 5927-4 and looked, 5027-55 and said, 559-4 [There is] nothing. 369 3972 And he said, 559-4 Go again 7725-3 seven 7651 times. 6471

18:44 And it came to pass at the seventh time, 7637 that he said, 559-4 Behold, there ariseth 5927-6 a little 6996 cloud 5645 out of the sea, 3220 like a man's 376 hand. 3709 And he said, 559-4 Go up, 5927-3 say 559-3 unto Ahab, 256 Prepare 631-3 [thy chariot], and get thee down, 3381-3 that the rain 1653 stop 6113-4 thee not.

18:45 And it came to pass in the mean while, 3541 that the heaven 8064 was black 6937-98 with clouds 5645 and wind, 7307 and there was a great 1419 rain. 1653 And Ahab 256 rode, 7392-4 and went 3212-4 to Jezreel. 3157

18:46 And the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 was on Elijah; 452 and he girded up 8151-17 his loins, 4975 and ran 7323-4 before 6440 Ahab 256 to the entrance 935-2 of Jezreel. 3157

19:1 And Ahab 256 told 5046-55 Jezebel 348 all that Elijah 452 had done, 6213-1 and withal how he had slain 2026-1 all the prophets 5030 with the sword. 2719

19:2 Then Jezebel 348 sent 7971-4 a messenger 4397 unto Elijah, 452 saying, 559-2 So let the gods 430 do 6213-4 [to me], and more 3254-55 also, if I make 7760-4 not thy life 5315 as the life 5315 of one 259 of them by to morrow 4279 about this time. 6256

19:3 And when he saw 7200-4 [that], he arose, 6965-4 and went 3212-4 for his life, 5315 and came 935-4 to Beersheba, 884 which [belongeth] to Judah, 3063 and left 3240-55 his servant 5288 there.

19:4 But he himself went 1980-1 a day's 3117 journey 1870 into the wilderness, 4057 and came 935-4 and sat down 3427-4 under a 259 juniper tree: 7574 and he requested 7592-4 for himself 5315 that he might die; 4191-2 and said, 559-4 It is enough; 7227 now, O LORD, 3068 take away 3947-3 my life; 5315 for I [am] not better 2896 than my fathers. 1

19:5 And as he lay 7901-4 and slept 3462-4 under a 259 juniper tree, 7574 behold, then an angel 4397 touched 5060-6 him, and said 559-4 unto him, Arise 6965-3 [and] eat. 398-3

19:6 And he looked, 5027-55 and, behold, [there was] a cake 5692 baken on the coals, 7529 and a cruse 6835 of water 4325 at his head. 4763 And he did eat 398-4 and drink, 8354-4 and laid him down 7901-4 again. 7725-4

19:7 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 came again 7725-4 the second time, 8145 and touched 5060-4 him, and said, 559-4 Arise 6965-3 [and] eat; 398-3 because the journey 1870 [is] too great 7227 for thee.

19:8 And he arose, 6965-4 and did eat 398-4 and drink, 8354-4 and went 3212-4 in the strength 3581 of that meat 396 forty 705 days 3117 and forty 705 nights 3915 unto Horeb 2722 the mount 2022 of God. 430

19:9 And he came 935-4 thither unto a cave, 4631 and lodged 3885-4 there; and, behold, the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 [came] to him, and he said 559-4 unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah? 452

19:10 And he said, 559-4 I have been very 7065-15 jealous 7065-14 for the LORD 3068 God 430 of hosts: 6635 for the children 1121 of Israel 3478 have forsaken 5800-1 thy covenant, 1285 thrown down 2040-1 thine altars, 4196 and slain 2026-1 thy prophets 5030 with the sword; 2719 and I, [even] I only, am left; 3498-11 and they seek 1245-17 my life, 5315 to take it away. 3947-2

19:11 And he said, 559-4 Go forth, 3318-3 and stand 5975-1 upon the mount 2022 before 6440 the LORD. 3068 And, behold, the LORD 3068 passed by, 5674-6 and a great 1419 and strong 2389 wind 7307 rent 6561-18 the mountains, 2022 and brake in pieces 7665-18 the rocks 5553 before 6440 the LORD; 3068 [but] the LORD 3068 [was] not in the wind: 7307 and after 310 the wind 7307 an earthquake; 7494 [but] the LORD 3068 [was] not in the earthquake: 7494

19:12 And after 310 the earthquake 7494 a fire; 784 [but] the LORD 3068 [was] not in the fire: 784 and after 310 the fire 784 a still 1827 small 1851 voice. 6963

19:13 And it was [so], when Elijah 452 heard 8085-2 [it], that he wrapped 3874-55 his face 6440 in his mantle, 155 and went out, 3318-4 and stood 5975-4 in the entering in 6607 of the cave. 4631 And, behold, [there came] a voice 6963 unto him, and said, 559-4 What doest thou here, Elijah? 452

19:14 And he said, 559-4 I have been very 7065-15 jealous 7065-14 for the LORD 3068 God 430 of hosts: 6635 because the children 1121 of Israel 3478 have forsaken 5800-1 thy covenant, 1285 thrown down 2040-1 thine altars, 4196 and slain 2026-1 thy prophets 5030 with the sword; 2719 and I, [even] I only, am left; 3498-11 and they seek 1245-17 my life, 5315 to take it away. 3947-2

19:15 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, Go, 3212-3 return 7725-3 on thy way 1870 to the wilderness 4057 of Damascus: 1834 and when thou comest, 935-1 anoint 4886-1 Hazael 2371 [to be] king 4428 over Syria: 758

19:16 And Jehu 3058 the son 1121 of Nimshi 5250 shalt thou anoint 4886-4 [to be] king 4428 over Israel: 3478 and Elisha 477 the son 1121 of Shaphat 8202 of Abelmeholah 65 shalt thou anoint 4886-4 [to be] prophet 5030 in thy room.

19:17 And it shall come to pass, [that] him that escapeth 4422-12 the sword 2719 of Hazael 2371 shall Jehu 3058 slay: 4191-55 and him that escapeth 4422-12 from the sword 2719 of Jehu 3058 shall Elisha 477 slay. 4191-55

19:18 Yet I have left 7604-52 [me] seven 7651 thousand 505 in Israel, 3478 all the knees 1290 which have not bowed 3766-1 unto Baal, 1168 and every mouth 6310 which hath not kissed 5401-1 him.

19:19 So he departed 3212-4 thence, and found 4672-4 Elisha 477 the son 1121 of Shaphat, 8202 who [was] plowing 2790-6 [with] twelve 8147 6240 yoke 6776 [of oxen] before 6440 him, and he with the twelfth: 8147 6240 and Elijah 452 passed by 5674-4 him, and cast 7993-55 his mantle 155 upon him.

19:20 And he left 5800-4 the oxen, 1241 and ran 7323-4 after 310 Elijah, 452 and said, 559-4 Let me, I pray thee, kiss 5401-4 my father 1 and my mother, 517 and [then] I will follow 3212-4 310 thee. And he said 559-4 unto him, Go 3212-3 back again: 7725-3 for what have I done 6213-1 to thee?

19:21 And he returned back 7725-4 from 310 him, and took 3947-4 a yoke 6776 of oxen, 1241 and slew 2076-4 them, and boiled 1310-14 their flesh 1320 with the instruments 3627 of the oxen, 1241 and gave 5414-4 unto the people, 5971 and they did eat. 398-4 Then he arose, 6965-4 and went 3212-4 after 310 Elijah, 452 and ministered 8334-17 unto him.

20:1 And Benhadad 1130 the king 4428 of Syria 758 gathered all his host 2428 together: 6908-1 and [there were] thirty 7970 and two 8147 kings 4428 with him, and horses, 5483 and chariots: 7393 and he went up 5927-4 and besieged 6696-4 Samaria, 8111 and warred 3898-11 against it.

20:2 And he sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 to Ahab 256 king 4428 of Israel 3478 into the city, 5892 and said 559-4 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 Benhadad, 1130

20:3 Thy silver 3701 and thy gold 2091 [is] mine; thy wives 802 also and thy children, 1121 [even] the goodliest, 2896 [are] mine.

20:4 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 My lord, 113 O king, 4428 according to thy saying, 1697 I [am] thine, and all that I have.

20:5 And the messengers 4397 came again, 7725-4 and said, 559-4 Thus speaketh 559-1 Benhadad, 1130 saying, 559-2 Although I have sent 7971-1 unto thee, saying, 559-2 Thou shalt deliver 5414-4 me thy silver, 3701 and thy gold, 2091 and thy wives, 802 and thy children; 1121

20:6 Yet I will send 7971-4 my servants 5650 unto thee to morrow 4279 about this time, 6256 and they shall search 2664-14 thine house, 1004 and the houses 1004 of thy servants; 5650 and it shall be, 1961-1 [that] whatsoever is pleasant 4261 in thine eyes, 5869 they shall put 7760-4 [it] in their hand, 3027 and take [it] away. 3947-1

20:7 Then the king 4428 of Israel 3478 called 7121-4 all the elders 2205 of the land, 776 and said, 559-4 Mark, 3045-3 I pray you, and see 7200-3 how this [man] seeketh 1245-18 mischief: 7451 for he sent 7971-1 unto me for my wives, 802 and for my children, 1121 and for my silver, 3701 and for my gold; 2091 and I denied 4513-1 him not.

20:8 And all the elders 2205 and all the people 5971 said 559-4 unto him, Hearken 8085-4 not [unto him], nor consent. 14-4

20:9 Wherefore he said 559-4 unto the messengers 4397 of Benhadad, 1130 Tell 559-3 my lord 113 the king, 4428 All that thou didst send 7971-1 for to thy servant 5650 at the first 7223 I will do: 6213-4 but this thing 1697 I may 3201-4 not do. 6213-2 And the messengers 4397 departed, 3212-4 and brought him word 1697 again. 7725-55

20:10 And Benhadad 1130 sent 7971-4 unto him, and said, 559-4 The gods 430 do 6213-4 so unto me, and more 3254-55 also, if the dust 6083 of Samaria 8111 shall suffice 5606-4 for handfuls 8168 for all the people 5971 that follow 7272 me.

20:11 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 Tell 1696-16 [him], Let not him that girdeth 2296-6 on [his harness] boast 1984-101 himself as he that putteth it off. 6605-18

20:12 And it came to pass, when [Benhadad] heard 8085-2 this message, 1697 as he [was] drinking, 8354-6 he and the kings 4428 in the pavilions, 5521 that he said 559-4 unto his servants, 5650 Set 7760-3 [yourselves in array]. And they set 7760-4 [themselves in array] against the city. 5892

20:13 And, behold, there came 5066-8 a 259 prophet 5030 unto Ahab 256 king 4428 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-4 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Hast thou seen 7200-1 all this great 1419 multitude? 1995 behold, I will deliver 5414-6 it into thine hand 3027 this day; 3117 and thou shalt know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

20:14 And Ahab 256 said, 559-4 By whom? And he said, 559-4 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 [Even] by the young men 5288 of the princes 8269 of the provinces. 4082 Then he said, 559-4 Who shall order 631-4 the battle? 4421 And he answered, 559-4 Thou.

20:15 Then he numbered 6485-4 the young men 5288 of the princes 8269 of the provinces, 4082 and they were two hundred 3967 and thirty 7970 two: 8147 and after 310 them he numbered 6485-1 all the people, 5971 [even] all the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 [being] seven 7651 thousand. 505

20:16 And they went out 3318-4 at noon. 6672 But Benhadad 1130 [was] drinking 8354-6 himself drunk 7910 in the pavilions, 5521 he and the kings, 4428 the thirty 7970 and two 8147 kings 4428 that helped 5826-6 him.

20:17 And the young men 5288 of the princes 8269 of the provinces 4082 went out 3318-4 first; 7223 and Benhadad 1130 sent out, 7971-4 and they told 5046-55 him, saying, 559-2 There are men 582 come out 3318-1 of Samaria. 8111

20:18 And he said, 559-4 Whether they be come out 3318-1 for peace, 7965 take 8610-3 them alive; 2416 or whether they be come out 3318-1 for war, 4421 take 8610-3 them alive. 2416

20:19 So these young men 5288 of the princes 8269 of the provinces 4082 came out 3318-1 of the city, 5892 and the army 2428 which followed 310 them.

20:20 And they slew 5221-55 every one 376 his man: 376 and the Syrians 758 fled; 5127-4 and Israel 3478 pursued 7291-4 them: and Benhadad 1130 the king 4428 of Syria 758 escaped 4422-11 on an horse 5483 with the horsemen. 6571

20:21 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 went out, 3318-4 and smote 5221-55 the horses 5483 and chariots, 7393 and slew 5221-52 the Syrians 758 with a great 1419 slaughter. 4347

20:22 And the prophet 5030 came 5066-4 to the king 4428 of Israel, 3478 and said 559-4 unto him, Go, 3212-3 strengthen 2388-100 thyself, and mark, 3045-3 and see 7200-3 what thou doest: 6213-4 for at the return 8666 of the year 8141 the king 4428 of Syria 758 will come up 5927-6 against thee.

20:23 And the servants 5650 of the king 4428 of Syria 758 said 559-1 unto him, Their gods 430 [are] gods 430 of the hills; 2022 therefore they were stronger 2388-1 than we; but 199 let us fight 3898-11 against them in the plain, 4334 and surely 3808 we shall be stronger 2388-4 than they.

20:24 And do 6213-3 this thing, 1697 Take the kings 4428 away, 5493-54 every man 376 out of his place, 4725 and put 7760-3 captains 6346 in their rooms:

20:25 And number 4487-4 thee an army, 2428 like the army 2428 that thou hast lost, 5307-6 horse 5483 for horse, 5483 and chariot 7393 for chariot: 7393 and we will fight 3898-11 against them 854 in the plain, 4334 [and] surely we shall be stronger 2388-4 than they. And he hearkened 8085-4 unto their voice, 6963 and did 6213-4 so.

20:26 And it came to pass at the return 8666 of the year, 8141 that Benhadad 1130 numbered 6485-4 the Syrians, 758 and went up 5927-4 to Aphek, 663 to fight 4421 against Israel. 3478

20:27 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 were numbered, 6485-120 and were all present, 3557-48 and went 3212-4 against 7125-2 them: and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 pitched 2583-4 before them like two 8147 little flocks 2835 of kids; 5795 but the Syrians 758 filled 4390-14 the country. 776

20:28 And there came 5066-4 a man 376 of God, 430 and spake 559-4 unto the king 4428 of Israel, 3478 and said, 559-4 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Because the Syrians 758 have said, 559-1 The LORD 3068 [is] God 430 of the hills, 2022 but he [is] not God 430 of the valleys, 6010 therefore will I deliver 5414-1 all this great 1419 multitude 1995 into thine hand, 3027 and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

20:29 And they pitched 2583-4 one 428 over against 5227 the other 428 seven 7651 days. 3117 And [so] it was, that in the seventh 7637 day 3117 the battle 4421 was joined: 7126-4 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 slew 5221-55 of the Syrians 758 an hundred 3967 thousand 505 footmen 7273 in one 259 day. 3117

20:30 But the rest 3498-12 fled 5127-4 to Aphek, 663 into the city; 5892 and [there] a wall 2346 fell 5307-4 upon twenty 6242 and seven 7651 thousand 505 of the men 376 [that were] left. 3498-12 And Benhadad 1130 fled, 5127-1 and came 935-4 into the city, 5892 into an inner 2315 chamber. 2315

20:31 And his servants 5650 said 559-4 unto him, Behold now, we have heard 8085-1 that the kings 4428 of the house 1004 of Israel 3478 [are] merciful 2617 kings: 4428 let us, I pray thee, put 7760-4 sackcloth 8242 on our loins, 4975 and ropes 2256 upon our heads, 7218 and go out 3318-4 to the king 4428 of Israel: 3478 peradventure he will save 2421-17 thy life. 5315

20:32 So they girded 2296-4 sackcloth 8242 on their loins, 4975 and [put] ropes 2256 on their heads, 7218 and came 935-4 to the king 4428 of Israel, 3478 and said, 559-4 Thy servant 5650 Benhadad 1130 saith, 559-1 I pray thee, let me 5315 live. 2421-4 And he said, 559-4 [Is] he yet alive? 2416 he [is] my brother. 251

20:33 Now the men 582 did diligently observe 5172-17 whether [any thing would come] from him, and did hastily 4116-17 catch 2480-55 [it]: and they said, 559-4 Thy brother 251 Benhadad. 1130 Then he said, 559-4 Go 935-3 ye, bring 3947-3 him. Then Benhadad 1130 came forth 3318-4 to him; and he caused him to come up 5927-55 into the chariot. 4818

20:34 And [Benhadad] said 559-4 unto him, The cities, 5892 which my father 1 took 3947-1 from thy father, 1 I will restore; 7725-55 and thou shalt make 7760-4 streets 2351 for thee in Damascus, 1834 as my father 1 made 7760-1 in Samaria. 8111 Then [said Ahab], I will send thee away 7971-17 with this covenant. 1285 So he made 3772-4 a covenant 1285 with him, and sent him away. 7971-17

20:35 And a certain 259 man 376 of the sons 1121 of the prophets 5030 said 559-1 unto his neighbour 7453 in the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 Smite 5221-54 me, I pray thee. And the man 376 refused 3985-17 to smite 5221-53 him.

20:36 Then said 559-4 he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed 8085-1 the voice 6963 of the LORD, 3068 behold, as soon as thou art departed 1980-6 from me, a lion 738 shall slay 5221-52 thee. And as soon as he was departed 3212-4 from him, 681 a lion 738 found 4672-4 him, and slew 5221-55 him.

20:37 Then he found 4672-4 another 312 man, 376 and said, 559-4 Smite 5221-54 me, I pray thee. And the man 376 smote 5221-55 him, so that in smiting 5221-53 he wounded 6481-2 [him].

20:38 So the prophet 5030 departed, 3212-4 and waited 5975-4 for the king 4428 by the way, 1870 and disguised 2664-101 himself with ashes 666 upon his face. 5869

20:39 And as the king 4428 passed by, 5674-6 he cried 6817-1 unto the king: 4428 and he said, 559-4 Thy servant 5650 went out 3318-1 into the midst 7130 of the battle; 4421 and, behold, a man 376 turned aside, 5493-1 and brought 935-55 a man 376 unto me, and said, 559-4 Keep 8104-3 this man: 376 if by any means 6485-9 he be missing, 6485-11 then shall thy life 5315 be for his life, 5315 or else thou shalt pay 8254-4 a talent 3603 of silver. 3701

20:40 And as thy servant 5650 was busy 6213-6 here and there, he was gone. 369 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto him, So [shall] thy judgment 4941 [be]; thyself hast decided 2782-1 [it].

20:41 And he hasted, 4116-17 and took the ashes 666 away 5493-55 from his face; 5869 and the king 4428 of Israel 3478 discerned 5234-55 him that he [was] of the prophets. 5030

20:42 And he said 559-4 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Because thou hast let go 7971-14 out of [thy] hand 3027 a man 376 whom I appointed to utter destruction, 2764 therefore thy life 5315 shall go for his life, 5315 and thy people 5971 for his people. 5971

20:43 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 went 3212-4 to his house 1004 heavy 5620 and displeased, 2198 and came 935-4 to Samaria. 8111

21:1 And it came to pass after 310 these things, 1697 [that] Naboth 5022 the Jezreelite 3158 had a vineyard, 3754 which [was] in Jezreel, 3157 hard by 681 the palace 1964 of Ahab 256 king 4428 of Samaria. 8111

21:2 And Ahab 256 spake 1696-17 unto Naboth, 5022 saying, 559-2 Give 5414-3 me thy vineyard, 3754 that I may have it for a garden 1588 of herbs, 3419 because it [is] near 7138 unto 681 my house: 1004 and I will give 5414-4 thee for it a better 2896 vineyard 3754 than it; [or], if it seem good 2896 to thee, 5869 I will give 5414-4 thee the worth 4242 of it in money. 3701

21:3 And Naboth 5022 said 559-4 to Ahab, 256 The LORD 3068 forbid 2486 it me, that I should give 5414-2 the inheritance 5159 of my fathers 1 unto thee.

21:4 And Ahab 256 came 935-4 into his house 1004 heavy 5620 and displeased 2198 because of the word 1697 which Naboth 5022 the Jezreelite 3158 had spoken 1696-14 to him: for he had said, 559-4 I will not give 5414-4 thee the inheritance 5159 of my fathers. 1 And he laid him down 7901-4 upon his bed, 4296 and turned away 5437-55 his face, 6440 and would eat 398-1 no bread. 3899

21:5 But Jezebel 348 his wife 802 came 935-4 to him, and said 1696-17 unto him, Why is thy spirit 7307 so sad, 5620 that thou eatest 398-6 no bread? 3899

21:6 And he said 1696-17 unto her, Because I spake 1696-17 unto Naboth 5022 the Jezreelite, 3158 and said 559-4 unto him, Give 5414-3 me thy vineyard 3754 for money; 3701 or else, if it please 2655 thee, I will give 5414-4 thee [another] vineyard 3754 for it: and he answered, 559-4 I will not give 5414-4 thee my vineyard. 3754

21:7 And Jezebel 348 his wife 802 said 559-4 unto him, Dost thou now govern 6213-4 the kingdom 4410 of Israel? 3478 arise, 6965-3 [and] eat 398-3 bread, 3899 and let thine heart 3820 be merry: 3190-4 I will give 5414-4 thee the vineyard 3754 of Naboth 5022 the Jezreelite. 3158

21:8 So she wrote 3789-4 letters 5612 in Ahab's 256 name, 8034 and sealed 2856-4 [them] with his seal, 2368 and sent 7971-4 the letters 5612 unto the elders 2205 and to the nobles 2715 that [were] in his city, 5892 dwelling 3427-6 with Naboth. 5022

21:9 And she wrote 3789-4 in the letters, 5612 saying, 559-2 Proclaim 7121-3 a fast, 6685 and set 3427-54 Naboth 5022 on high 7218 among the people: 5971

21:10 And set 3427-54 two 8147 men, 582 sons 1121 of Belial, 1100 before him, to bear witness 5749-55 against him, saying, 559-2 Thou didst blaspheme 1288-14 God 430 and the king. 4428 And [then] carry him out, 3318-52 and stone 5619-3 him, that he may die. 4191-4

21:11 And the men 582 of his city, 5892 [even] the elders 2205 and the nobles 2715 who were the inhabitants 3427-6 in his city, 5892 did 6213-4 as Jezebel 348 had sent 7971-1 unto them, [and] as it [was] written 3789-7 in the letters 5612 which she had sent 7971-1 unto them.

21:12 They proclaimed 7121-1 a fast, 6685 and set 3427-52 Naboth 5022 on high 7218 among the people. 5971

21:13 And there came 935-4 in two 8147 men, 582 children 1121 of Belial, 1100 and sat 3427-4 before him: and the men 582 of Belial 1100 witnessed 5749-55 against him, [even] against Naboth, 5022 in the presence of the people, 5971 saying, 559-2 Naboth 5022 did blaspheme 1288-14 God 430 and the king. 4428 Then they carried him forth 3318-55 out 2351 of the city, 5892 and stoned 5619-4 him with stones, 68 that he died. 4191-4

21:14 Then they sent 7971-4 to Jezebel, 348 saying, 559-2 Naboth 5022 is stoned, 5619-27 and is dead. 4191-4

21:15 And it came to pass, when Jezebel 348 heard 8085-2 that Naboth 5022 was stoned, 5619-27 and was dead, 4191-4 that Jezebel 348 said 559-4 to Ahab, 256 Arise, 6965-3 take possession 3423-3 of the vineyard 3754 of Naboth 5022 the Jezreelite, 3158 which he refused 3985-14 to give 5414-2 thee for money: 3701 for Naboth 5022 is not alive, 2416 but dead. 4191-1

21:16 And it came to pass, when Ahab 256 heard 8085-2 that Naboth 5022 was dead, 4191-1 that Ahab 256 rose up 6965-4 to go down 3381-2 to the vineyard 3754 of Naboth 5022 the Jezreelite, 3158 to take possession 3423-2 of it.

21:17 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came to Elijah 452 the Tishbite, 8664 saying, 559-2

21:18 Arise, 6965-3 go down 3381-3 to meet 7125-2 Ahab 256 king 4428 of Israel, 3478 which [is] in Samaria: 8111 behold, [he is] in the vineyard 3754 of Naboth, 5022 whither he is gone down 3381-1 to possess 3423-2 it.

21:19 And thou shalt speak 1696-14 unto him, saying, 559-2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Hast thou killed, 7523-1 and also taken possession? 3423-1 And thou shalt speak 1696-14 unto him, saying, 559-2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 In the place 4725 where dogs 3611 licked 3952-1 the blood 1818 of Naboth 5022 shall dogs 3611 lick 3952-4 thy blood, 1818 even thine.

21:20 And Ahab 256 said 559-4 to Elijah, 452 Hast thou found 4672-1 me, O mine enemy? 341-6 And he answered, 559-4 I have found 4672-1 [thee]: because thou hast sold 4376-99 thyself to work 6213-2 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD. 3068

21:21 Behold, I will bring 935-56 evil 7451 upon thee, and will take away 1197-14 thy posterity, 310 and will cut off 3772-52 from Ahab 256 him that pisseth 8366-56 against the wall, 7023 and him that is shut up 6113-7 and left 5800-7 in Israel, 3478

21:22 And will make 5414-1 thine house 1004 like the house 1004 of Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 and like the house 1004 of Baasha 1201 the son 1121 of Ahijah, 281 for the provocation 3708 wherewith thou hast provoked [me] to anger, 3707-52 and made Israel 3478 to sin. 2398-55

21:23 And of Jezebel 348 also spake 1696-14 the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 The dogs 3611 shall eat 398-4 Jezebel 348 by the wall 2426 of Jezreel. 3157

21:24 Him that dieth 4191-5 of Ahab 256 in the city 5892 the dogs 3611 shall eat; 398-4 and him that dieth 4191-5 in the field 7704 shall the fowls 5775 of the air 8064 eat. 398-4

21:25 But there was none like unto Ahab, 256 which did sell 4376-98 himself to work 6213-2 wickedness 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 whom Jezebel 348 his wife 802 stirred up. 5496-52

21:26 And he did very 3966 abominably 8581-55 in following 3212-2 310 idols, 1544 according to all [things] as did 6213-1 the Amorites, 567 whom the LORD 3068 cast out 3423-52 before 6440 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

21:27 And it came to pass, when Ahab 256 heard 8085-2 those words, 1697 that he rent 7167-4 his clothes, 899 and put 7760-4 sackcloth 8242 upon his flesh, 1320 and fasted, 6684-4 and lay 7901-4 in sackcloth, 8242 and went 1980-17 softly. 328

21:28 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came to Elijah 452 the Tishbite, 8664 saying, 559-2

21:29 Seest 7200-1 thou how Ahab 256 humbleth 3665-8 himself before 6440 me? because 3282 he humbleth 3665-8 himself before 6440 me, I will not bring 935-55 the evil 7451 in his days: 3117 [but] in his son's 1121 days 3117 will I bring 935-55 the evil 7451 upon his house. 1004

22:1 And they continued 3427-4 three 7969 years 8141 without war 4421 between Syria 758 and Israel. 3478

22:2 And it came to pass in the third 7992 year, 8141 that Jehoshaphat 3092 the king 4428 of Judah 3063 came down 3381-4 to the king 4428 of Israel. 3478

22:3 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto his servants, 5650 Know 3045-1 ye that Ramoth 7433 in Gilead 1568 [is] ours, and we [be] still, 2814-56 [and] take 3947-2 it not out of the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Syria? 758

22:4 And he said 559-4 unto Jehoshaphat, 3092 Wilt thou go 3212-4 with me to battle 4421 to Ramothgilead? 7433 1568 And Jehoshaphat 3092 said 559-4 to the king 4428 of Israel, 3478 I [am] as thou 3644 [art], my people 5971 as thy people, 5971 my horses 5483 as thy horses. 5483

22:5 And Jehoshaphat 3092 said 559-4 unto the king 4428 of Israel, 3478 Enquire, 1875-3 I pray thee, at the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 to day. 3117

22:6 Then the king 4428 of Israel 3478 gathered the prophets 5030 together, 6908-4 about four 702 hundred 3967 men, 376 and said 559-4 unto them, Shall I go 3212-4 against Ramothgilead 7433 1568 to battle, 4421 or shall I forbear? 2308-4 And they said, 559-4 Go up; 5927-3 for the Lord 136 shall deliver 5414-4 [it] into the hand 3027 of the king. 4428

22:7 And Jehoshaphat 3092 said, 559-4 [Is there] not here a prophet 5030 of the LORD 3068 besides, 5750 that we might enquire 1875-4 of him?

22:8 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto Jehoshaphat, 3092 [There is] yet one 259 man, 376 Micaiah 4321 the son 1121 of Imlah, 3229 by whom we may enquire 1875-2 of the LORD: 3068 but I hate 8130-1 him; for he doth not prophesy 5012-101 good 2896 concerning me, but evil. 7451 And Jehoshaphat 3092 said, 559-4 Let not the king 4428 say 559-4 so.

22:9 Then the king 4428 of Israel 3478 called 7121-4 an 259 officer, 5631 and said, 559-4 Hasten 4116-16 [hither] Micaiah 4321 the son 1121 of Imlah. 3229

22:10 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 and Jehoshaphat 3092 the king 4428 of Judah 3063 sat 3427-6 each 376 on his throne, 3678 having put on 3847-30 their robes, 899 in a void place 1637 in the entrance 6607 of the gate 8179 of Samaria; 8111 and all the prophets 5030 prophesied 5012-102 before 6440 them.

22:11 And Zedekiah 6667 the son 1121 of Chenaanah 3668 made 6213-4 him horns 7161 of iron: 1270 and he said, 559-4 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 With these shalt thou push 5055-17 the Syrians, 758 until thou have consumed 3615-15 them.

22:12 And all the prophets 5030 prophesied 5012-12 so, saying, 559-2 Go up 5927-3 to Ramothgilead, 7433 1568 and prosper: 6743-54 for the LORD 3068 shall deliver 5414-1 [it] into the king's 4428 hand. 3027

22:13 And the messenger 4397 that was gone 1980-1 to call 7121-2 Micaiah 4321 spake 1696-14 unto him, saying, 559-2 Behold now, the words 1697 of the prophets 5030 [declare] good 2896 unto the king 4428 with one 259 mouth: 6310 let thy word, 1697 I pray thee, be like the word 1697 of one 259 of them, and speak 1696-14 [that which is] good. 2896

22:14 And Micaiah 4321 said, 559-4 [As] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 what the LORD 3068 saith 559-4 unto me, that will I speak. 1696-17

22:15 So he came 935-4 to the king. 4428 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto him, Micaiah, 4321 shall we go 3212-4 against Ramothgilead 7433 1568 to battle, 4421 or shall we forbear? 2308-4 And he answered 559-4 him, Go, 5927-3 and prosper: 6743-54 for the LORD 3068 shall deliver 5414-1 [it] into the hand 3027 of the king. 4428

22:16 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto him, How many times 6471 shall I adjure 7650-56 thee that thou tell 1696-17 me nothing but [that which is] true 571 in the name 8034 of the LORD? 3068

22:17 And he said, 559-4 I saw 7200-1 all Israel 3478 scattered 6327-12 upon the hills, 2022 as sheep 6629 that have not a shepherd: 7462-6 and the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 These have no master: 113 let them return 7725-4 every man 376 to his house 1004 in peace. 7965

22:18 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto Jehoshaphat, 3092 Did I not tell 559-1 thee that he would prophesy 5012-101 no good 2896 concerning me, but evil? 7451

22:19 And he said, 559-4 Hear 8085-3 thou therefore the word 1697 of the LORD: 3068 I saw 7200-1 the LORD 3068 sitting 3427-6 on his throne, 3678 and all the host 6635 of heaven 8064 standing 5975-6 by him on his right hand 3225 and on his left. 8040

22:20 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 Who shall persuade 6601-17 Ahab, 256 that he may go up 5927-4 and fall 5307-4 at Ramothgilead? 7433 1568 And one said 559-4 on this manner, 3541 and another said 559-6 on that manner. 3541

22:21 And there came forth 3318-4 a spirit, 7307 and stood 5975-4 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 I will persuade 6601-17 him.

22:22 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, Wherewith? And he said, 559-4 I will go forth, 3318-4 and I will be a lying 8267 spirit 7307 in the mouth 6310 of all his prophets. 5030 And he said, 559-4 Thou shalt persuade 6601-17 [him], and prevail 3201-4 also: go forth, 3318-3 and do 6213-3 so.

22:23 Now therefore, behold, the LORD 3068 hath put 5414-1 a lying 8267 spirit 7307 in the mouth 6310 of all these thy prophets, 5030 and the LORD 3068 hath spoken 1696-14 evil 7451 concerning thee.

22:24 But Zedekiah 6667 the son 1121 of Chenaanah 3668 went near, 5066-4 and smote 5221-55 Micaiah 4321 on the cheek, 3895 and said, 559-4 Which way 335 went 5674-1 the Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 from me to speak 1696-15 unto thee?

22:25 And Micaiah 4321 said, 559-4 Behold, thou shalt see 7200-6 in that day, 3117 when thou shalt go 935-4 into an inner 2315 chamber 2315 to hide 2247-9 thyself.

22:26 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 said, 559-4 Take 3947-3 Micaiah, 4321 and carry him back 7725-54 unto Amon 526 the governor 8269 of the city, 5892 and to Joash 3101 the king's 4428 son; 1121

22:27 And say, 559-1 Thus saith 559-1 the king, 4428 Put 7760-3 this [fellow] in the prison, 1004 3608 and feed 398-54 him with bread 3899 of affliction 3906 and with water 4325 of affliction, 3906 until I come 935-2 in peace. 7965

22:28 And Micaiah 4321 said, 559-4 If thou return 7725-4 at all 7725-2 in peace, 7965 the LORD 3068 hath not spoken 1696-14 by me. And he said, 559-4 Hearken, 8085-3 O people, 5971 every one of you.

22:29 So the king 4428 of Israel 3478 and Jehoshaphat 3092 the king 4428 of Judah 3063 went up 5927-4 to Ramothgilead. 7433 1568

22:30 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto Jehoshaphat, 3092 I will disguise 2664-99 myself, and enter 935-2 into the battle; 4421 but put thou on 3847-3 thy robes. 899 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 disguised 2664-101 himself, and went 935-4 into the battle. 4421

22:31 But the king 4428 of Syria 758 commanded 6680-14 his thirty 7970 and two 8147 captains 8269 that had rule over his chariots, 7393 saying, 559-2 Fight 3898-11 neither with small 6996 nor great, 1419 save only with the king 4428 of Israel. 3478

22:32 And it came to pass, when the captains 8269 of the chariots 7393 saw 7200-2 Jehoshaphat, 3092 that they said, 559-1 Surely it [is] the king 4428 of Israel. 3478 And they turned aside 5493-4 to fight 3898-9 against him: and Jehoshaphat 3092 cried out. 2199-4

22:33 And it came to pass, when the captains 8269 of the chariots 7393 perceived 7200-2 that it [was] not the king 4428 of Israel, 3478 that they turned back 7725-4 from pursuing 310 him.

22:34 And a [certain] man 376 drew 4900-1 a bow 7198 at a venture, 8537 and smote 5221-55 the king 4428 of Israel 3478 between the joints 1694 of the harness: 8302 wherefore he said 559-4 unto the driver of his chariot, 7395 Turn 2015-3 thine hand, 3027 and carry me out 3318-54 of the host; 4264 for I am wounded. 2470-90

22:35 And the battle 4421 increased 5927-4 that day: 3117 and the king 4428 was stayed up 5975-94 in his chariot 4818 against 5227 the Syrians, 758 and died 4191-4 at even: 6153 and the blood 1818 ran out 3332-4 of the wound 4347 into the midst 2436 of the chariot. 7393

22:36 And there went 5674-4 a proclamation 7440 throughout the host 4264 about the going down 935-2 of the sun, 8121 saying, 559-2 Every man 376 to his city, 5892 and every man 376 to his own country. 776

22:37 So the king 4428 died, 4191-4 and was brought 935-4 to Samaria; 8111 and they buried 6912-4 the king 4428 in Samaria. 8111

22:38 And [one] washed 7857-4 the chariot 7393 in the pool 1295 of Samaria; 8111 and the dogs 3611 licked up 3952-4 his blood; 1818 and they washed 7364-1 his armour; 2185 according unto the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 which he spake. 1696-14

22:39 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Ahab, 256 and all that he did, 6213-1 and the ivory 8127 house 1004 which he made, 1129-1 and all the cities 5892 that he built, 1129-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel? 3478

22:40 So Ahab 256 slept 7901-4 with his fathers; 1 and Ahaziah 274 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

22:41 And Jehoshaphat 3092 the son 1121 of Asa 609 began to reign 4427-1 over Judah 3063 in the fourth 702 year 8141 of Ahab 256 king 4428 of Israel. 3478

22:42 Jehoshaphat 3092 [was] thirty 7970 and five 2568 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign; 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 twenty 6242 and five 2568 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Azubah 5806 the daughter 1323 of Shilhi. 7977

22:43 And he walked 3212-4 in all the ways 1870 of Asa 609 his father; 1 he turned not aside 5493-1 from it, doing 6213-2 [that which was] right 3477 in the eyes 5869 of the LORD: 3068 nevertheless the high places 1116 were not taken away; 5493-1 [for] the people 5971 offered 2076-18 and burnt incense 6999-18 yet in the high places. 1116

22:44 And Jehoshaphat 3092 made peace 7999-55 with the king 4428 of Israel. 3478

22:45 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Jehoshaphat, 3092 and his might 1369 that he shewed, 6213-1 and how he warred, 3898-8 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Judah? 3063

22:46 And the remnant 3499 of the sodomites, 6945 which remained 7604-8 in the days 3117 of his father 1 Asa, 609 he took out 1197-14 of the land. 776

22:47 [There was] then no king 4428 in Edom: 123 a deputy 5324-12 [was] king. 4428

22:48 Jehoshaphat 3092 made 6213-1|6240-k ships 591 of Tharshish 8659 to go 3212-2 to Ophir 211 for gold: 2091 but they went 1980-1 not; for the ships 591 were broken 7665-8 at Eziongeber. 6100

22:49 Then said 559-1 Ahaziah 274 the son 1121 of Ahab 256 unto Jehoshaphat, 3092 Let my servants 5650 go 3212-4 with thy servants 5650 in the ships. 591 But Jehoshaphat 3092 would 14-1 not.

22:50 And Jehoshaphat 3092 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and was buried 6912-11 with his fathers 1 in the city 5892 of David 1732 his father: 1 and Jehoram 3088 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

22:51 Ahaziah 274 the son 1121 of Ahab 256 began to reign 4427-1 over Israel 3478 in Samaria 8111 the seventeenth 7651 6240 year 8141 of Jehoshaphat 3092 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and reigned 4427-4 two years 8141 over Israel. 3478

22:52 And he did 6213-4 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 and walked 3212-4 in the way 1870 of his father, 1 and in the way 1870 of his mother, 517 and in the way 1870 of Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 who made Israel 3478 to sin: 2398-52

22:53 For he served 5647-4 Baal, 1168 and worshipped 7812-101 him, and provoked to anger 3707-55 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 according to all that his father 1 had done. 6213-1
