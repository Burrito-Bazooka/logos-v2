1:1 There was a man 376 in the land 776 of Uz, 5780 whose name 8034 [was] Job; 347 and that man 376 was perfect 8535 and upright, 3477 and one that feared 3373 God, 430 and eschewed 5493-6 evil. 7451

1:2 And there were born 3205-11 unto him seven 7651 sons 1121 and three 7969 daughters. 1323

1:3 His substance 4735 also was seven 7651 thousand 505 sheep, 6629 and three 7969 thousand 505 camels, 1581 and five 2568 hundred 3967 yoke 6776 of oxen, 1241 and five 2568 hundred 3967 she asses, 860 and a very 3966 great 7227 household; 5657 so that this man 376 was the greatest 1419 of all the men 1121 of the east. 6924

1:4 And his sons 1121 went 1980-1 and feasted 4960 6213-1 [in their] houses, 1004 every one 376 his day; 3117 and sent 7971-1 and called 7121-1 for their three 7969 sisters 269 to eat 398-2 and to drink 8354-2 with them.

1:5 And it was so, when the days 3117 of [their] feasting 4960 were gone about, 5362-52 that Job 347 sent 7971-4 and sanctified 6942-17 them, and rose up early 7925-52 in the morning, 1242 and offered 5927-52 burnt offerings 5930 [according] to the number 4557 of them all: for Job 347 said, 559-1 It may be 194 that my sons 1121 have sinned, 2398-1 and cursed 1288-14 God 430 in their hearts. 3824 Thus did 6213-4 Job 347 continually. 3605 3117

1:6 Now there was a day 3117 when the sons 1121 of God 430 came 935-4 to present 3320-99 themselves before the LORD, 3068 and Satan 7854 came 935-4 also among 8432 them.

1:7 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Satan, 7854 Whence 370 comest 935-4 thou? Then Satan 7854 answered 6030-4 the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 From going to and fro 7751-2 in the earth, 776 and from walking up and down 1980-99 in it.

1:8 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Satan, 7854 Hast thou considered 7760-1 3820 my servant 5650 Job, 347 that [there is] none like him in the earth, 776 a perfect 8535 and an upright 3477 man, 376 one that feareth 3373 God, 430 and escheweth 5493-6 evil? 7451

1:9 Then Satan 7854 answered 6030-4 the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 Doth Job 347 fear 3372-1 God 430 for nought? 2600

1:10 Hast not thou made an hedge 7753-1 about him, 1157 and about 1157 his house, 1004 and about 1157 all 3605 that he hath 834 on every side? 5439 thou hast blessed 1288-14 the work 4639 of his hands, 3027 and his substance 4735 is increased 6555-1 in the land. 776

1:11 But 199 put forth 7971-3 thine hand 3027 now, and touch 5060-3 all that he hath, and he will 3808 curse 1288-17 thee to thy face. 6440

1:12 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Satan, 7854 Behold, all that he hath [is] in thy power; 3027 only upon himself put not forth 7971-4 thine hand. 3027 So Satan 7854 went forth 3318-4 from the presence 6440 of the LORD. 3068

1:13 And there was a day 3117 when his sons 1121 and his daughters 1323 [were] eating 398-6 and drinking 8354-6 wine 3196 in their eldest 1060 brother's 251 house: 1004

1:14 And there came 935-1 a messenger 4397 unto Job, 347 and said, 559-4 The oxen 1241 were plowing, 2790-6 and the asses 860 feeding 7462-6 beside them: 3027

1:15 And the Sabeans 7614 fell 5307-4 [upon them], and took them away; 3947-4 yea, they have slain 5221-52 the servants 5288 with the edge 6310 of the sword; 2719 and I only am escaped 4422-11 alone to tell 5046-53 thee.

1:16 While he [was] yet speaking, 1696-18 there came 935-6 also another, and said, 559-4 The fire 784 of God 430 is fallen 5307-1 from heaven, 8064 and hath burned up 1197-4 the sheep, 6629 and the servants, 5288 and consumed 398-4 them; and I only am escaped 4422-11 alone to tell 5046-53 thee.

1:17 While he [was] yet speaking, 1696-18 there came 935-6 also another, and said, 559-4 The Chaldeans 3778 made out 7760-1 three 7969 bands, 7218 and fell 6584-4 upon the camels, 1581 and have carried them away, 3947-4 yea, and slain 5221-52 the servants 5288 with the edge 6310 of the sword; 2719 and I only am escaped 4422-11 alone to tell 5046-53 thee.

1:18 While he [was] yet speaking, 1696-18 there came 935-6 also another, and said, 559-4 Thy sons 1121 and thy daughters 1323 [were] eating 398-6 and drinking 8354-6 wine 3196 in their eldest 1060 brother's 251 house: 1004

1:19 And, behold, there came 935-1 a great 1419 wind 7307 from 5676 the wilderness, 4057 and smote 5060-4 the four 702 corners 6438 of the house, 1004 and it fell 5307-4 upon the young men, 5288 and they are dead; 4191-4 and I only am escaped 4422-11 alone to tell 5046-53 thee.

1:20 Then Job 347 arose, 6965-4 and rent 7167-4 his mantle, 4598 and shaved 1494-4 his head, 7218 and fell down 5307-4 upon the ground, 776 and worshipped, 7812-101

1:21 And said, 559-4 Naked 6174 came I out 3318-1 of my mother's 517 womb, 990 and naked 6174 shall I return 7725-4 thither: the LORD 3068 gave, 5414-1 and the LORD 3068 hath taken away; 3947-1 blessed 1288-30 be the name 8034 of the LORD. 3068

1:22 In all this Job 347 sinned 2398-1 not, nor charged 5414-1 God 430 foolishly. 8604

2:1 Again there was a day 3117 when the sons 1121 of God 430 came 935-4 to present 3320-99 themselves before the LORD, 3068 and Satan 7854 came 935-4 also among 8432 them to present 3320-99 himself before the LORD. 3068

2:2 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Satan, 7854 From whence 335 comest 935-4 thou? And Satan 7854 answered 6030-4 the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 From going to and fro 7751-2 in the earth, 776 and from walking up and down 1980-99 in it.

2:3 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Satan, 7854 Hast thou considered 7760-1 3820 my servant 5650 Job, 347 that [there is] none like him in the earth, 776 a perfect 8535 and an upright 3477 man, 376 one that feareth 3373 God, 430 and escheweth 5493-6 evil? 7451 and still he holdeth 2388-56 fast his integrity, 8538 although thou movedst 5496-55 me against him, to destroy 1104-15 him without cause. 2600

2:4 And Satan 7854 answered 6030-4 the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 Skin 5785 for skin, 5785 yea, all that a man 376 hath will he give 5414-4 for his life. 5315

2:5 But 199 put forth 7971-3 thine hand 3027 now, and touch 5060-3 his bone 6106 and his flesh, 1320 and he will curse 1288-17 thee to thy face. 6440

2:6 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Satan, 7854 Behold, he [is] in thine hand; 3027 but save 8104-3 his life. 5315

2:7 So went Satan 7854 forth 3318-4 from the presence 6440 of the LORD, 3068 and smote 5221-55 Job 347 with sore 7451 boils 7822 from the sole 3709 of his foot 7272 unto his crown. 6936

2:8 And he took 3947-4 him a potsherd 2789 to scrape 1623-99 himself withal; and he sat down 3427-6 among 8432 the ashes. 665

2:9 Then said 559-4 his wife 802 unto him, Dost thou still retain 2388-56 thine integrity? 8538 curse 1288-16 God, 430 and die. 4191-3

2:10 But he said 559-4 unto her, Thou speakest 1696-17 as one 259 of the foolish women 5036 speaketh. 1696-15 What? 1571 shall we receive 6901-17 good 2896 at the hand of God, 430 and shall we not receive 6901-17 evil? 7451 In all this did not Job 347 sin 2398-1 with his lips. 8193

2:11 Now when Job's 347 three 7969 friends 7453 heard 8085-4 of all this evil 7451 that was come 935-6 upon him, they came 935-4 every one 376 from his own place; 4725 Eliphaz 464 the Temanite, 8489 and Bildad 1085 the Shuhite, 7747 and Zophar 6691 the Naamathite: 5284 for they had made an appointment 3259-11 together 3162 to come 935-2 to mourn 5110-2 with him and to comfort 5162-15 him.

2:12 And when they lifted up 5375-4 their eyes 5869 afar off, 7350 and knew 5234-52 him not, they lifted up 5375-4 their voice, 6963 and wept; 1058-4 and they rent 7167-4 every one 376 his mantle, 4598 and sprinkled 2236-4 dust 6083 upon their heads 7218 toward heaven. 8064

2:13 So they sat down 3427-4 with him upon the ground 776 seven 7651 days 3117 and seven 7651 nights, 3915 and none spake 1696-6 a word 1697 unto him: for they saw 7200-1 that [his] grief 3511 was very 3966 great. 1431-1

3:1 After 310 this opened 6605-1 Job 347 his mouth, 6310 and cursed 7043-17 his day. 3117

3:2 And Job 347 spake, 6030-4 and said, 559-4

3:3 Let the day 3117 perish 6-4 wherein I was born, 3205-11 and the night 3915 [in which] it was said, 559-1 There is a man 1397 child conceived. 2029-27

3:4 Let that day 3117 be darkness; 2822 let not God 433 regard 1875-4 it from above, 4605 neither let the light 5105 shine 3313-55 upon it.

3:5 Let darkness 2822 and the shadow of death 6757 stain 1350-4 it; let a cloud 6053 dwell 7931-4 upon it; let the blackness 3650 of the day 3117 terrify 1204-17 it.

3:6 As [for] that night, 3915 let darkness 652 seize 3947-4 upon it; let it not be joined 2302-4 unto the days 3117 of the year, 8141 let it not come 935-4 into the number 4557 of the months. 3391

3:7 Lo, let that night 3915 be solitary, 1565 let no joyful voice 7445 come 935-4 therein.

3:8 Let them curse 5344-4 it that curse 779-6 the day, 3117 who are ready 6264 to raise up 5782-32 their mourning. 3882

3:9 Let the stars 3556 of the twilight 5399 thereof be dark; 2821-4 let it look 6960-17 for light, 216 but [have] none; neither let it see 7200-4 the dawning 6079 of the day: 7837

3:10 Because it shut 5462-1 not up the doors 1817 of my [mother's] womb, 990 nor hid 5641-55 sorrow 5999 from mine eyes. 5869

3:11 Why died 4191-4 I not from the womb? 7358 [why] did I [not] give up the ghost 1478-4 when I came out 3318-1 of the belly? 990

3:12 Why did the knees 1290 prevent 6923-14 me? or why the breasts 7699 that I should suck? 3243-4

3:13 For now should I have lain still 7901-1 and been quiet, 8252-4 I should have slept: 3462-1 then had I been at rest, 5117-4

3:14 With kings 4428 and counsellors 3289-6 of the earth, 776 which built 1129-6 desolate places 2723 for themselves;

3:15 Or with princes 8269 that had gold, 2091 who filled 4390-18 their houses 1004 with silver: 3701

3:16 Or as an hidden 2934-7 untimely birth 5309 I had not been; as infants 5768 [which] never saw 7200-1 light. 216

3:17 There the wicked 7563 cease 2308-1 [from] troubling; 7267 and there the weary 3019 3581 be at rest. 5117-4

3:18 [There] the prisoners 615 rest 7599-40 together; 3162 they hear 8085-1 not the voice 6963 of the oppressor. 5065-6

3:19 The small 6996 and great 1419 are there; and the servant 5650 [is] free 2670 from his master. 113

3:20 Wherefore is light 216 given 5414-4 to him that is in misery, 6001 and life 2416 unto the bitter 4751 [in] soul; 5315

3:21 Which long 2442-18 for death, 4194 but it [cometh] not; and dig 2658-4 for it more than for hid treasures; 4301

3:22 Which rejoice 8056 exceedingly, 1524 [and] are glad, 7797-4 when they can find 4672-4 the grave? 6913

3:23 [Why is light given] to a man 1397 whose way 1870 is hid, 5641-8 and whom God 433 hath hedged in? 5526-55

3:24 For my sighing 585 cometh 935-4 before 6440 I eat, 3899 and my roarings 7581 are poured out 5413-4 like the waters. 4325

3:25 For the thing which I greatly 6343 feared 6342-1 is come 857-4 upon me, and that which I was afraid 3025-1 of is come 935-4 unto me.

3:26 I was not in safety, 7951-1 neither had I rest, 8252-1 neither was I quiet; 5117-1 yet trouble 7267 came. 935-4

4:1 Then Eliphaz 464 the Temanite 8489 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4

4:2 [If] we assay 5254-14 to commune 1697 with thee, wilt thou be grieved? 3811-4 but who can 3201-4 withhold 6113-2 himself from speaking? 4405

4:3 Behold, thou hast instructed 3256-14 many, 7227 and thou hast strengthened 2388-17 the weak 7504 hands. 3027

4:4 Thy words 4405 have upholden 6965-55 him that was falling, 3782-6 and thou hast strengthened 553-17 the feeble 3766-6 knees. 1290

4:5 But now it is come 935-4 upon thee, and thou faintest; 3811-4 it toucheth 5060-4 thee, and thou art troubled. 926-11

4:6 [Is] not [this] thy fear, 3374 thy confidence, 3690 thy hope, 8615 and the uprightness 8537 of thy ways? 1870

4:7 Remember, 2142-3 I pray thee, who [ever] perished, 6-1 being innocent? 5355 or where 375 were the righteous 3477 cut off? 3582-8

4:8 Even as I have seen, 7200-1 they that plow 2790-6 iniquity, 205 and sow 2232-6 wickedness, 5999 reap 7114-4 the same.

4:9 By the blast 5397 of God 433 they perish, 6-4 and by the breath 7307 of his nostrils 639 are they consumed. 3615-4

4:10 The roaring 7581 of the lion, 738 and the voice 6963 of the fierce lion, 7826 and the teeth 8127 of the young lions, 3715 are broken. 5421-8

4:11 The old lion 3918 perisheth 6-6 for lack 1097 of prey, 2964 and the stout lion's 3833 whelps 1121 are scattered abroad. 6504-101

4:12 Now a thing 1697 was secretly brought 1589-29 to me, and mine ear 241 received 3947-4 a little 8102 thereof.

4:13 In thoughts 5587 from the visions 2384 of the night, 3915 when deep sleep 8639 falleth 5307-2 on men, 582

4:14 Fear 6343 came 7122-1 upon me, and trembling, 7461 which made all 7230 my bones 6106 to shake. 6342-52

4:15 Then a spirit 7307 passed 2498-4 before my face; 6440 the hair 8185 of my flesh 1320 stood up: 5568-17

4:16 It stood still, 5975-4 but I could not discern 5234-55 the form 4758 thereof: an image 8544 [was] before mine eyes, 5869 [there was] silence, 1827 and I heard 8085-4 a voice, 6963 [saying],

4:17 Shall mortal man 582 be more just 6663-4 than God? 433 shall a man 1397 be more pure 2891-4 than his maker? 6213-6

4:18 Behold, he put no trust 539-55 in his servants; 5650 and his angels 4397 he charged 7760-4 with folly: 8417

4:19 How much less 637 [in] them that dwell 7931-6 in houses 1004 of clay, 2563 whose foundation 3247 [is] in the dust, 6083 [which] are crushed 1792-17 before 6440 the moth? 6211

4:20 They are destroyed 3807-93 from morning 1242 to evening: 6153 they perish 6-4 for ever 5331 without any regarding 7760-56 [it].

4:21 Doth not their excellency 3499 [which is] in them go away? 5265-8 they die, 4191-4 even without wisdom. 2451

5:1 Call 7121-3 now, if there be 3426 any that will answer 6030-6 thee; and to which of the saints 6918 wilt thou turn? 6437-4

5:2 For wrath 3708 killeth 2026-4 the foolish man, 191 and envy 7068 slayeth 4191-55 the silly one. 6601-6

5:3 I have seen 7200-1 the foolish 191 taking root: 8327-56 but suddenly 6597 I cursed 5344-4 his habitation. 5116

5:4 His children 1121 are far 7368-4 from safety, 3468 and they are crushed 1792-101 in the gate, 8179 neither [is there] any to deliver 5337-56 [them].

5:5 Whose harvest 7105 the hungry 7457 eateth up, 398-4 and taketh 3947-4 it even out 413 of the thorns, 6791 and the robber 6782 swalloweth up 7602-1 their substance. 2428

5:6 Although affliction 205 cometh not forth 3318-4 of the dust, 6083 neither doth trouble 5999 spring 6779-4 out of the ground; 127

5:7 Yet man 120 is born 3205-27 unto trouble, 5999 as the sparks 1121 7565 fly 5774-2 upward. 1361-55

5:8 I would 199 seek 1875-4 unto God, 410 and unto God 430 would I commit 7760-4 my cause: 1700

5:9 Which doeth 6213-6 great 1419 things and unsearchable; 369 2714 marvellous things 6381-12 without number: 4557

5:10 Who giveth 5414-6 rain 4306 upon 6440 the earth, 776 and sendeth 7971-6 waters 4325 upon 6440 the fields: 2351

5:11 To set up 7760-2 on high 4791 those that be low; 8217 that those which mourn 6937-6 may be exalted 7682-1 to safety. 3468

5:12 He disappointeth 6565-56 the devices 4284 of the crafty, 6175 so that their hands 3027 cannot perform 6213-4 [their] enterprise. 8454

5:13 He taketh 3920-6 the wise 2450 in their own craftiness: 6193 and the counsel 6098 of the froward 6617-12 is carried headlong. 4116-12

5:14 They meet 6298-17 with darkness 2822 in the daytime, 3119 and grope 4959-17 in the noonday 6672 as in the night. 3915

5:15 But he saveth 3467-55 the poor 34 from the sword, 2719 from their mouth, 6310 and from the hand 3027 of the mighty. 2389

5:16 So the poor 1800 hath hope, 8615 and iniquity 5766 stoppeth 7092-1 her mouth. 6310

5:17 Behold, happy 835 [is] the man 582 whom God 433 correcteth: 3198-55 therefore despise 3988-4 not thou the chastening 4148 of the Almighty: 7706

5:18 For he maketh sore, 3510-55 and bindeth up: 2280-4 he woundeth, 4272-4 and his hands 3027 make whole. 7495-4

5:19 He shall deliver 5337-55 thee in six 8337 troubles: 6869 yea, in seven 7651 there shall no evil 7451 touch 5060-4 thee.

5:20 In famine 7458 he shall redeem 6299-1 thee from death: 4194 and in war 4421 from the power 3027 of the sword. 2719

5:21 Thou shalt be hid 2244-11 from the scourge 7752 of the tongue: 3956 neither shalt thou be afraid 3372-4 of destruction 7701 when it cometh. 935-4

5:22 At destruction 7701 and famine 3720 thou shalt laugh: 7832-4 neither shalt thou be afraid 3372-4 of the beasts 2416 of the earth. 776

5:23 For thou shalt be in league 1285 with the stones 68 of the field: 7704 and the beasts 2416 of the field 7704 shall be at peace 7999-90 with thee.

5:24 And thou shalt know 3045-1 that thy tabernacle 168 [shall be] in peace; 7965 and thou shalt visit 6485-1 thy habitation, 5116 and shalt not sin. 2398-4

5:25 Thou shalt know 3045-1 also that thy seed 2233 [shall be] great, 7227 and thine offspring 6631 as the grass 6212 of the earth. 776

5:26 Thou shalt come 935-4 to [thy] grave 6913 in a full age, 3624 like as a shock of corn 1430 cometh in 5927-2 in his season. 6256

5:27 Lo this, we have searched 2713-1 it, so it [is]; hear 8085-3 it, and know 3045-3 thou [it] for thy good.

6:1 But Job 347 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4

6:2 Oh that 3863 my grief 3708 were throughly 8254-2 weighed, 8254-11 and my calamity 1942|1962-k laid 5375-4 in the balances 3976 together! 3162

6:3 For now it would be heavier 3513-4 than the sand 2344 of the sea: 3220 therefore my words 1697 are swallowed up. 3886-1

6:4 For the arrows 2671 of the Almighty 7706 [are] within me, 5978 the poison 2534 whereof drinketh 8354-6 up my spirit: 7307 the terrors 1161 of God 433 do set themselves in array 6186-4 against me.

6:5 Doth the wild ass 6501 bray 5101-4 when he hath grass? 1877 or loweth 1600-4 the ox 7794 over his fodder? 1098

6:6 Can that which is unsavoury 8602 be eaten 398-11 without salt? 4417 or is there 3426 [any] taste 2940 in the white 7388 of an egg? 2495

6:7 The things [that] my soul 5315 refused 3985-14 to touch 5060-2 [are] as my sorrowful 1741 meat. 3899

6:8 Oh that 5414-4 I might have 935-4 my request; 7596 and that God 433 would grant 5414-4 [me] the thing that I long for! 8615

6:9 Even that it would please 2974-55 God 433 to destroy 1792-17 me; that he would let loose 5425-55 his hand, 3027 and cut me off! 1214-17

6:10 Then should I yet have comfort; 5165 yea, I would harden 5539-17 myself in sorrow: 2427 let him not spare; 2550-4 for I have not concealed 3582-14 the words 561 of the Holy One. 6918

6:11 What [is] my strength, 3581 that I should hope? 3176-17 and what [is] mine end, 7093 that I should prolong 748-55 my life? 5315

6:12 [Is] my strength 3581 the strength 3581 of stones? 68 or [is] my flesh 1320 of brass? 5153

6:13 [Is] not my help 5833 in me? and is wisdom 8454 driven quite 5080-8 from me?

6:14 To him that is afflicted 4523 pity 2617 [should be shewed] from his friend; 7453 but he forsaketh 5800-4 the fear 3374 of the Almighty. 7706

6:15 My brethren 251 have dealt deceitfully 898-1 as a brook, 5158 [and] as the stream 650 of brooks 5158 they pass away; 5674-4

6:16 Which are blackish 6937-6 by reason of the ice, 7140 [and] wherein the snow 7950 is hid: 5956-101

6:17 What time 6256 they wax warm, 2215-29 they vanish: 6789-8 when it is hot, 2527 they are consumed 1846-8 out of their place. 4725

6:18 The paths 734 of their way 1870 are turned aside; 3943-11 they go 5927-4 to nothing, 8414 and perish. 6-4

6:19 The troops 734 of Tema 8485 looked, 5027-52 the companies 1979 of Sheba 7614 waited 6960-14 for them.

6:20 They were confounded 954-1 because they had hoped; 982-1 they came 935-1 thither, and were ashamed. 2659-4

6:21 For now ye are nothing; ye see 7200-4 [my] casting down, 2866 and are afraid. 3372-4

6:22 Did I say, 559-1 Bring 3051-3 unto me? or, Give a reward 7809-3 for me of your substance? 3581

6:23 Or, Deliver 4422-16 me from the enemy's 6862 hand? 3027 or, Redeem 6299-4 me from the hand 3027 of the mighty? 6184

6:24 Teach 3384-54 me, and I will hold my tongue: 2790-55 and cause me to understand 995-54 wherein I have erred. 7686-1

6:25 How forcible 4834-8 are right 3476 words! 561 but what doth your arguing 3198-53 reprove? 3198-55

6:26 Do ye imagine 2803-4 to reprove 3198-53 words, 4405 and the speeches 561 of one that is desperate, 2976-12 [which are] as wind? 7307

6:27 Yea, ye overwhelm 5307-55 the fatherless, 3490 and ye dig 3738-4 [a pit] for your friend. 7453

6:28 Now therefore be content, 2974-54 look 6437-3 upon me; for [it is] evident unto 6440 you if I lie. 3576-17

6:29 Return, 7725-3 I pray you, let it not be iniquity; 5766 yea, return 7725-3 again, my righteousness 6664 [is] in it.

6:30 Is there 3426 iniquity 5766 in my tongue? 3956 cannot my taste 2441 discern 995-4 perverse things? 1942

7:1 [Is there] not an appointed time 6635 to man 582 upon earth? 776 [are not] his days 3117 also like the days 3117 of an hireling? 7916

7:2 As a servant 5650 earnestly desireth 7602-4 the shadow, 6738 and as an hireling 7916 looketh 6960-17 for [the reward of] his work: 6467

7:3 So am I made to possess 5157-90 months 3391 of vanity, 7723 and wearisome 5999 nights 3915 are appointed 4487-14 to me.

7:4 When I lie down, 7901-1 I say, 559-1 When shall I arise, 6965-4 and the night 6153 be gone? 4059 and I am full 7646-1 of tossings to and fro 5076 unto the dawning of the day. 5399

7:5 My flesh 1320 is clothed 3847-1 with worms 7415 and clods 1487 of dust; 6083 my skin 5785 is broken, 7280-1 and become loathsome. 3988-11

7:6 My days 3117 are swifter 7043-1 than a weaver's shuttle, 708 and are spent 3615-4 without 657 hope. 8615

7:7 O remember 2142-3 that my life 2416 [is] wind: 7307 mine eye 5869 shall no more 7725-4 see 7200-2 good. 2896

7:8 The eye 5869 of him that hath seen 7210 me shall see 7789-4 me no [more]: thine eyes 5869 [are] upon me, and I [am] not.

7:9 [As] the cloud 6051 is consumed 3615-1 and vanisheth 3212-4 away: so he that goeth down 3381-6 to the grave 7585 shall come up 5927-4 no [more].

7:10 He shall return 7725-4 no more to his house, 1004 neither shall his place 4725 know 5234-55 him any more.

7:11 Therefore I will not refrain 2820-4 my mouth; 6310 I will speak 1696-17 in the anguish 6862 of my spirit; 7307 I will complain 7878-4 in the bitterness 4751 of my soul. 5315

7:12 [Am] I a sea, 3220 or a whale, 8577 that thou settest 7760-4 a watch 4929 over me?

7:13 When I say, 559-1 My bed 6210 shall comfort 5162-17 me, my couch 4904 shall ease 5375-4 my complaint; 7879

7:14 Then thou scarest 2865-14 me with dreams, 2472 and terrifiest 1204-17 me through visions: 2384

7:15 So that my soul 5315 chooseth 977-4 strangling, 4267 [and] death 4194 rather than my life. 6106

7:16 I loathe 3988-1 [it]; I would not live 2421-4 alway: 5769 let me alone; 2308-3 for my days 3117 [are] vanity. 1892

7:17 What [is] man, 582 that thou shouldest magnify 1431-17 him? and that thou shouldest set 7896-4 thine heart 3820 upon him?

7:18 And [that] thou shouldest visit 6485-4 him every morning, 1242 [and] try 974-4 him every moment? 7281

7:19 How long 4100 wilt thou not depart 8159-4 from me, nor let me alone 7503-55 till I swallow down 1104-2 my spittle? 7536

7:20 I have sinned; 2398-1 what shall I do 6466-4 unto thee, O thou preserver 5341-6 of men? 120 why hast thou set 7760-1 me as a mark 4645 against thee, so that I am a burden 4853 to myself?

7:21 And why dost thou not pardon 5375-4 my transgression, 6588 and take away 5674-55 mine iniquity? 5771 for now shall I sleep 7901-4 in the dust; 6083 and thou shalt seek me in the morning, 7836-14 but I [shall] not [be].

8:1 Then answered 6030-4 Bildad 1085 the Shuhite, 7747 and said, 559-4

8:2 How 575 long 5704 wilt thou speak 4448-17 these [things]? and [how long shall] the words 561 of thy mouth 6310 [be like] a strong 3524 wind? 7307

8:3 Doth God 410 pervert 5791-17 judgment? 4941 or doth the Almighty 7706 pervert 5791-17 justice? 6664

8:4 If thy children 1121 have sinned 2398-1 against him, and he have cast them away 7971-17 for 3027 their transgression; 6588

8:5 If thou wouldest seek unto God 410 betimes, 7836-17 and make thy supplication 2603-101 to the Almighty; 7706

8:6 If thou [wert] pure 2134 and upright; 3477 surely now he would awake 5782-55 for thee, and make the habitation 5116 of thy righteousness 6664 prosperous. 7999-14

8:7 Though thy beginning 7225 was small, 4705 yet thy latter end 319 should greatly 3966 increase. 7685-4

8:8 For enquire, 7592-3 I pray thee, of the former 7223|7223-k age, 1755 and prepare 3559-33 thyself to the search 2714 of their fathers: 1

8:9 (For we [are but of] yesterday, 8543 and know 3045-4 nothing, because our days 3117 upon earth 776 [are] a shadow:) 6738

8:10 Shall not they teach 3384-55 thee, [and] tell 559-4 thee, and utter 3318-55 words 4405 out of their heart? 3820

8:11 Can the rush 1573 grow up 1342-4 without mire? 1207 can the flag 260 grow 7685-4 without 1097 water? 4325

8:12 Whilst it [is] yet in his greenness, 3 [and] not cut down, 6998-11 it withereth 3001-4 before 6440 any [other] herb. 2682

8:13 So [are] the paths 734 of all that forget 7911-6 God; 410 and the hypocrite's 2611 hope 8615 shall perish: 6-4

8:14 Whose hope 3689 shall be cut off, 6990-4 and whose trust 4009 [shall be] a spider's 5908 web. 1004

8:15 He shall lean 8172-11 upon his house, 1004 but it shall not stand: 5975-4 he shall hold 2388-55 it fast, but it shall not endure. 6965-4

8:16 He [is] green 7373 before 6440 the sun, 8121 and his branch 3127 shooteth forth 3318-4 in his garden. 1593

8:17 His roots 8328 are wrapped about 5440-29 the heap, 1530 [and] seeth 2372-4 the place 1004 of stones. 68

8:18 If he destroy 1104-17 him from his place, 4725 then [it] shall deny 3584-14 him, [saying], I have not seen 7200-1 thee.

8:19 Behold, this [is] the joy 4885 of his way, 1870 and out of the earth 6083 shall others 312 grow. 6779-4

8:20 Behold, God 410 will not cast away 3988-4 a perfect 8535 [man], neither will he help 2388-55 3027 the evil doers: 7489-56

8:21 Till he fill 4390-17 thy mouth 6310 with laughing, 7814 and thy lips 8193 with rejoicing. 8643

8:22 They that hate 8130-6 thee shall be clothed 3847-4 with shame; 1322 and the dwelling place 168 of the wicked 7563 shall come to nought. 369

9:1 Then Job 347 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4

9:2 I know 3045-1 [it is] so of a truth: 551 but how should man 582 be just 6663-4 with God? 410

9:3 If he will 2654-4 contend 7378-2 with him, he cannot answer 6030-4 him one 259 of a thousand. 505

9:4 [He is] wise 2450 in heart, 3824 and mighty 533 in strength: 3581 who hath hardened 7185-52 [himself] against him, and hath prospered? 7999-4

9:5 Which removeth 6275-56 the mountains, 2022 and they know 3045-1 not: which overturneth 2015-1 them in his anger. 639

9:6 Which shaketh 7264-56 the earth 776 out of her place, 4725 and the pillars 5982 thereof tremble. 6426-101

9:7 Which commandeth 559-6 the sun, 2775 and it riseth 2224-4 not; and sealeth up 2856-4 the stars. 3556

9:8 Which alone spreadeth out 5186-6 the heavens, 8064 and treadeth 1869-6 upon the waves 1116 of the sea. 3220

9:9 Which maketh 6213-6 Arcturus, 5906 Orion, 3685 and Pleiades, 3598 and the chambers 2315 of the south. 8486

9:10 Which doeth 6213-6 great 1419 things past 369 finding out; 2714 yea, and wonders 6381-12 without number. 4557

9:11 Lo, he goeth 5674-4 by me, and I see 7200-4 [him] not: he passeth on 2498-4 also, but I perceive 995-4 him not.

9:12 Behold, he taketh away, 2862-4 who can hinder 7725-55 him? who will say 559-4 unto him, What doest 6213-4 thou?

9:13 [If] God 433 will not withdraw 7725-55 his anger, 639 the proud 7293 helpers 5826-6 do stoop 7817-1 under him.

9:14 How much less shall I answer 6030-4 him, [and] choose 977-4 out my words 1697 [to reason] with him?

9:15 Whom, though I were righteous, 6663-1 [yet] would I not answer, 6030-4 [but] I would make supplication 2603-101 to my judge. 8199-26

9:16 If I had called, 7121-1 and he had answered 6030-4 me; [yet] would I not believe 539-55 that he had hearkened 238-55 unto my voice. 6963

9:17 For he breaketh 7779-4 me with a tempest, 8183 and multiplieth 7235-52 my wounds 6482 without cause. 2600

9:18 He will not suffer 5414-4 me to take 7725-53 my breath, 7307 but filleth 7646-55 me with bitterness. 4472

9:19 If [I speak] of strength, 3581 lo, [he is] strong: 533 and if of judgment, 4941 who shall set me a time 3259-55 [to plead]?

9:20 If I justify 6663-4 myself, mine own mouth 6310 shall condemn 7561-55 me: [if I say], I [am] perfect, 8535 it shall also prove me perverse. 6140-4

9:21 [Though] I [were] perfect, 8535 [yet] would I not know 3045-4 my soul: 5315 I would despise 3988-4 my life. 2416

9:22 This [is] one 259 [thing], therefore I said 559-1 [it], He destroyeth 3615-18 the perfect 8535 and the wicked. 7563

9:23 If the scourge 7752 slay 4191-55 suddenly, 6597 he will laugh 3932-4 at the trial 4531 of the innocent. 5355

9:24 The earth 776 is given 5414-8 into the hand 3027 of the wicked: 7563 he covereth 3680-17 the faces 6440 of the judges 8199-6 thereof; if not, where, 645 [and] who [is] he?

9:25 Now my days 3117 are swifter 7043-1 than a post: 7323-5 they flee away, 1272-1 they see 7200-1 no good. 2896

9:26 They are passed away 2498-1 as 5973 the swift 16|15 ships: 591 as the eagle 5404 [that] hasteth 2907-4 to the prey. 400

9:27 If I say, 559-2 I will forget 7911-4 my complaint, 7879 I will leave off 5800-4 my heaviness, 6440 and comfort 1082-55 [myself]:

9:28 I am afraid 3025-1 of all my sorrows, 6094 I know 3045-1 that thou wilt not hold me innocent. 5352-17

b9:29 [If] I be wicked, 7561-4 why then labour 3021-4 I in vain? 1892

9:30 If I wash 7364-98 myself with 1119 snow 7950 water, 4325|1119-k and make my hands 3709 never 1253 so clean; 2141-52

9:31 Yet 227 shalt thou plunge 2881-4 me in the ditch, 7845 and mine own clothes 8008 shall abhor 8581-14 me.

9:32 For [he is] not a man, 376 as I [am, that] I should answer 6030-4 him, [and] we should come 935-4 together 3162 in judgment. 4941

9:33 Neither is 3426 there any daysman 3198-56 betwixt us, [that] might lay 7896-4 his hand 3027 upon us both. 8147

9:34 Let him take his rod 7626 away 5493-55 from me, and let not his fear 367 terrify 1204-17 me:

9:35 [Then] would I speak, 1696-17 and not fear 3372-4 him; but [it is] not so with me.

10:1 My soul 5315 is weary 5354-1 of my life; 2416 I will leave 5800-4 my complaint 7879 upon myself; I will speak 1696-17 in the bitterness 4751 of my soul. 5315

10:2 I will say 559-4 unto God, 433 Do not condemn 7561-55 me; shew 3045-54 me wherefore thou contendest 7378-4 with me.

10:3 [Is it] good 2895-1 unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, 6231-4 that thou shouldest despise 3988-4 the work 3018 of thine hands, 3709 and shine 3313-52 upon the counsel 6098 of the wicked? 7563

10:4 Hast thou eyes 5869 of flesh? 1320 or seest 7200-4 thou as man 582 seeth? 7200-2

10:5 [Are] thy days 3117 as the days 3117 of man? 582 [are] thy years 8141 as man's 1397 days, 3117

10:6 That thou enquirest 1245-17 after mine iniquity, 5771 and searchest 1875-4 after my sin? 2403

10:7 Thou knowest 1847 that I am not wicked; 7561-4 and [there is] none that can deliver 5337-56 out of thine hand. 3027

10:8 Thine hands 3027 have made 6087-14 me and fashioned 6213-4 me together 3162 round about; 5439 yet thou dost destroy 1104-17 me.

10:9 Remember, 2142-3 I beseech thee, that thou hast made 6213-1 me as the clay; 2563 and wilt thou bring me into dust 6083 again? 7725-55

10:10 Hast thou not poured me out 5413-55 as milk, 2461 and curdled 7087-55 me like cheese? 1385

10:11 Thou hast clothed 3847-55 me with skin 5785 and flesh, 1320 and hast fenced 7753-34 me with bones 6106 and sinews. 1517

10:12 Thou hast granted 6213-1 me life 2416 and favour, 2617 and thy visitation 6486 hath preserved 8104-1 my spirit. 7307

10:13 And these [things] hast thou hid 6845-1 in thine heart: 3824 I know 3045-1 that this [is] with thee.

10:14 If I sin, 2398-1 then thou markest 8104-1 me, and thou wilt not acquit 5352-17 me from mine iniquity. 5771

10:15 If I be wicked, 7561-1 woe 480 unto me; and [if] I be righteous, 6663-1 [yet] will I not lift up 5375-4 my head. 7218 [I am] full 7649 of confusion; 7036 therefore see 7202 thou mine affliction; 6040

10:16 For it increaseth. 1342-4 Thou huntest 6679-4 me as a fierce lion: 7826 and again 7725-4 thou shewest thyself marvellous 6381-101 upon me.

10:17 Thou renewest 2318-17 thy witnesses 5707 against me, and increasest 7235-55 thine indignation 3708 upon me; 5978 changes 2487 and war 6635 [are] against me.

10:18 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth 3318-52 out of the womb? 7358 Oh that I had given up the ghost, 1478-4 and no eye 5869 had seen 7200-4 me!

10:19 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried 2986-93 from the womb 990 to the grave. 6913

10:20 [Are] not my days 3117 few? 4592 cease 2308-3|2308-4-k [then, and] let 7896-3|7896-4-k me alone, that I may take comfort 1082-55 a little, 4592

10:21 Before I go 3212-4 [whence] I shall not return, 7725-4 [even] to the land 776 of darkness 2822 and the shadow of death; 6757

10:22 A land 776 of darkness, 5890 as darkness 652 [itself; and] of the shadow of death, 6757 without any order, 5468 and [where] the light 3313-55 [is] as darkness. 652

11:1 Then answered 6030-4 Zophar 6691 the Naamathite, 5284 and said, 559-4

11:2 Should not the multitude 7230 of words 1697 be answered? 6030-11 and should a man 376 full of talk 8193 be justified? 6663-4

11:3 Should thy lies 907 make men 4962 hold their peace? 2790-55 and when thou mockest, 3932-4 shall no man make thee ashamed? 3637-56

11:4 For thou hast said, 559-4 My doctrine 3948 [is] pure, 2134 and I am clean 1249 in thine eyes. 5869

11:5 But 199 oh that 5414-4 God 433 would speak, 1696-15 and open 6605-4 his lips 8193 against thee;

11:6 And that he would shew 5046-55 thee the secrets 8587 of wisdom, 2451 that [they are] double 3718 to that which is! 8454 Know 3045-3 therefore that God 433 exacteth 5382-55 of thee [less] than thine iniquity 5771 [deserveth].

11:7 Canst thou by searching 2714 find out 4672-4 God? 433 canst thou find out 4672-4 the Almighty 7706 unto perfection? 8503

11:8 [It is] as high 1363 as heaven; 8064 what canst thou do? 6466-4 deeper 6013 than hell; 7585 what canst thou know? 3045-4

11:9 The measure 4055 thereof [is] longer 752 than the earth, 776 and broader 7342 than the sea. 3220

11:10 If he cut off, 2498-4 and shut up, 5462-55 or gather together, 6950-55 then who can hinder 7725-55 him?

11:11 For he knoweth 3045-1 vain 7723 men: 4962 he seeth 7200-4 wickedness 205 also; will he not then consider 995-113 [it]?

11:12 For vain 5014-7 man 376 would be wise, 3823-11 though man 120 be born 3205-11 [like] a wild ass's 6501 colt. 5895

11:13 If thou prepare 3559-52 thine heart, 3820 and stretch out 6566-1 thine hands 3709 toward him;

11:14 If iniquity 205 [be] in thine hand, 3027 put it far away, 7368-54 and let not wickedness 5766 dwell 7931-55 in thy tabernacles. 168

11:15 For then shalt thou lift up 5375-4 thy face 6440 without spot; 3971 yea, thou shalt be stedfast, 3332-94 and shalt not fear: 3372-4

11:16 Because thou shalt forget 7911-4 [thy] misery, 5999 [and] remember 2142-4 [it] as waters 4325 [that] pass away: 5674-1

11:17 And [thine] age 2465 shall be clearer 6965-4 than the noonday; 6672 thou shalt shine forth, 5774-4 thou shalt be as the morning. 1242

11:18 And thou shalt be secure, 982-1 because there is 3426 hope; 8615 yea, thou shalt dig 2658-1 [about thee, and] thou shalt take thy rest 7901-4 in safety. 983

11:19 Also thou shalt lie down, 7257-1 and none shall make [thee] afraid; 2729-56 yea, many 7227 shall make suit 2470-14 unto thee. 6440

11:20 But the eyes 5869 of the wicked 7563 shall fail, 3615-4 and they shall not escape, 6-1 4498 and their hope 8615 [shall be as] the giving up 4646 of the ghost. 5315

12:1 And Job 347 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4

12:2 No doubt 551 but ye [are] the people, 5971 and wisdom 2451 shall die 4191-4 with you.

12:3 But 1571 I have understanding 3824 as well as you; 3644 I [am] not inferior 5307-6 to you: yea, who knoweth not such things 3644 as these?

12:4 I am [as] one mocked 7814 of his neighbour, 7453 who calleth 7121-6 upon God, 433 and he answereth 6030-4 him: the just 6662 upright 8549 [man is] laughed to scorn. 7814

12:5 He that is ready 3559-12 to slip 4571-6 with [his] feet 7272 [is as] a lamp 3940 despised 937 in the thought 6248 of him that is at ease. 7600

12:6 The tabernacles 168 of robbers 7703-6 prosper, 7951-4 and they that provoke 7264-56 God 410 are secure; 987 into whose hand 3027 God 433 bringeth 935-52 [abundantly].

12:7 But 199 ask 7592-3 now the beasts, 929 and they shall teach 3384-55 thee; and the fowls 5775 of the air, 8064 and they shall tell 5046-55 thee:

12:8 Or speak 7878-3 to the earth, 776 and it shall teach 3384-55 thee: and the fishes 1709 of the sea 3220 shall declare 5608-17 unto thee.

12:9 Who knoweth 3045-1 not in all these that the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 hath wrought 6213-1 this?

12:10 In whose hand 3027 [is] the soul 5315 of every living thing, 2416 and the breath 7307 of all mankind. 376 1320

12:11 Doth not the ear 241 try 974-4 words? 4405 and the mouth 2441 taste 2938-4 his meat? 400

12:12 With the ancient 3453 [is] wisdom; 2451 and in length 753 of days 3117 understanding. 8394

12:13 With him [is] wisdom 2451 and strength, 1369 he hath counsel 6098 and understanding. 8394

12:14 Behold, he breaketh down, 2040-4 and it cannot 3808 be built 1129-11 again: he shutteth 5462-4 up a man, 376 and there can be no 3808 opening. 6605-11

12:15 Behold, he withholdeth 6113-4 the waters, 4325 and they dry up: 3001-4 also he sendeth them out, 7971-17 and they overturn 2015-4 the earth. 776

12:16 With him [is] strength 5797 and wisdom: 8454 the deceived 7683-6 and the deceiver 7686-56 [are] his.

12:17 He leadeth 3212-56 counsellors 3289-6 away spoiled, 7758 and maketh the judges 8199-6 fools. 1984-25

12:18 He looseth 6605-14 the bond 4148 of kings, 4428 and girdeth 631-4 their loins 4975 with a girdle. 232

12:19 He leadeth 3212-56 princes 3548 away spoiled, 7758 and overthroweth 5557-17 the mighty. 386

12:20 He removeth away 5493-56 the speech 8193 of the trusty, 539-12 and taketh away 3947-4 the understanding 2940 of the aged. 2205

12:21 He poureth 8210-6 contempt 937 upon princes, 5081 and weakeneth 7503-14 the strength 4206 of the mighty. 650

12:22 He discovereth 1540-18 deep things 6013 out of darkness, 2822 and bringeth out 3318-55 to light 216 the shadow of death. 6757

12:23 He increaseth 7679-56 the nations, 1471 and destroyeth 6-17 them: he enlargeth 7849-6 the nations, 1471 and straiteneth 5148-55 them [again].

12:24 He taketh away 5493-56 the heart 3820 of the chief 7218 of the people 5971 of the earth, 776 and causeth them to wander 8582-55 in a wilderness 8414 [where there is] no way. 1870

12:25 They grope 4959-17 in the dark 2822 without light, 216 and he maketh them to stagger 8582-55 like [a] drunken 7910 [man].

13:1 Lo, mine eye 5869 hath seen 7200-1 all [this], mine ear 241 hath heard 8085-1 and understood 995-4 it.

13:2 What ye know, 1847 [the same] do I know 3045-1 also: I [am] not inferior 5307-6 unto you.

13:3 Surely 199 I would speak 1696-17 to the Almighty, 7706 and I desire 2654-4 to reason 3198-53 with God. 410

13:4 But 199 ye [are] forgers 2950-6 of lies, 8267 ye [are] all physicians 7495-6 of no value. 457

13:5 O that 5414-4 ye would altogether 2790-53 hold your peace! 2790-55 and it should be your wisdom. 2451

13:6 Hear 8085-3 now my reasoning, 8433 and hearken 7181-54 to the pleadings 7379 of my lips. 8193

13:7 Will ye speak 1696-17 wickedly 5766 for God? 410 and talk 1696-17 deceitfully 7423 for him?

13:8 Will ye accept 5375-4 his person? 6440 will ye contend 7378-4 for God? 410

13:9 Is it good 2895-1 that he should search 2713-4 you out? or as one man mocketh 2048-15 another, 582 do ye [so] mock 2048-17 him?

13:10 He will surely 3198-53 reprove 3198-55 you, if ye do secretly 5643 accept 5375-4 persons. 6440

13:11 Shall not his excellency 7613 make you afraid? 1204-17 and his dread 6343 fall 5307-4 upon you?

13:12 Your remembrances 2146 [are] like 4912 unto ashes, 665 your bodies 1354 to bodies 1354 of clay. 2563

13:13 Hold your peace, 2790-54 let me alone, that I may speak, 1696-17 and let come 5674-4 on me what [will].

13:14 Wherefore do I take 5375-4 my flesh 1320 in my teeth, 8127 and put 7760-4 my life 5315 in mine hand? 3709

13:15 Though 2005 he slay 6991-4 me, yet will I trust 3176-17 in him: but I will maintain 3198-55 mine own ways 1870 before 6440 him.

13:16 He also [shall be] my salvation: 3444 for an hypocrite 2611 shall not come 935-4 before 6440 him.

13:17 Hear 8085-3 diligently 8085-2 my speech, 4405 and my declaration 262 with your ears. 241

13:18 Behold now, I have ordered 6186-1 [my] cause; 4941 I know 3045-1 that I shall be justified. 6663-4

13:19 Who [is] he [that] will plead 7378-4 with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, 2790-55 I shall give up the ghost. 1478-4

13:20 Only do 6213-4 not two 8147 [things] unto me: then will I not hide 5641-11 myself from thee. 6440

13:21 Withdraw thine hand 3709 far 7368-54 from me: and let not thy dread 367 make me afraid. 1204-17

13:22 Then call 7121-3 thou, and I will answer: 6030-4 or let me speak, 1696-17 and answer 7725-54 thou me.

13:23 How many [are] mine iniquities 5771 and sins? 2403 make me to know 3045-54 my transgression 6588 and my sin. 2403

13:24 Wherefore hidest 5641-55 thou thy face, 6440 and holdest 2803-4 me for thine enemy? 341-6

13:25 Wilt thou break 6206-4 a leaf 5929 driven to and fro? 5086-12 and wilt thou pursue 7291-4 the dry 3002 stubble? 7179

13:26 For thou writest 3789-4 bitter things 4846 against me, and makest me to possess 3423-55 the iniquities 5771 of my youth. 5271

13:27 Thou puttest 7760-4 my feet 7272 also in the stocks, 5465 and lookest narrowly 8104-4 unto all my paths; 734 thou settest a print 2707-101 upon the heels 8328 of my feet. 7272

13:28 And he, as a rotten thing, 7538 consumeth, 1086-4 as a garment 899 that is moth 6211 eaten. 398-1

14:1 Man 120 [that is] born 3205-7 of a woman 802 [is] of few 7116 days, 3117 and full 7649 of trouble. 7267

14:2 He cometh forth 3318-1 like a flower, 6731 and is cut down: 5243-4 he fleeth 1272-4 also as a shadow, 6738 and continueth 5975-4 not.

14:3 And dost thou open 6491-1 thine eyes 5869 upon such an one, 2088 and bringest 935-55 me into judgment 4941 with thee?

14:4 Who can bring 5414-4 a clean 2889 [thing] out of an unclean? 2931 not one. 259

14:5 Seeing 518 his days 3117 [are] determined, 2782-7 the number 4557 of his months 2320 [are] with thee, thou hast appointed 6213-1 his bounds 2706 that he cannot pass; 5674-4

14:6 Turn 8159-3 from him, that he may rest, 2308-4 till he shall accomplish, 7521-4 as an hireling, 7916 his day. 3117

14:7 For there is 3426 hope 8615 of a tree, 6086 if it be cut down, 3772-11 that it will sprout 2498-55 again, and that the tender branch 3127 thereof will not cease. 2308-4

14:8 Though the root 8328 thereof wax old 2204-55 in the earth, 776 and the stock 1503 thereof die 4191-4 in the ground; 6083

14:9 [Yet] through the scent 7381 of water 4325 it will bud, 6524-55 and bring forth 6213-1 boughs 7105 like a plant. 5194

14:10 But man 1397 dieth, 4191-4 and wasteth away: 2522-4 yea, man 120 giveth up the ghost, 1478-4 and where [is] he?

14:11 [As] the waters 4325 fail 235-1 from the sea, 3220 and the flood 5104 decayeth 2717-4 and drieth up: 3001-1

14:12 So man 376 lieth down, 7901-1 and riseth 6965-4 not: till the heavens 8064 [be] no more, 1115 they shall not awake, 6974-55 nor be raised 5782-11 out of their sleep. 8142

14:13 O that 5414-4 thou wouldest hide 6845-55 me in the grave, 7585 that thou wouldest keep me secret, 5641-55 until thy wrath 639 be past, 7725-2 that thou wouldest appoint 7896-4 me a set time, 2706 and remember 2142-4 me!

14:14 If a man 1397 die, 4191-4 shall he live 2421-4 [again]? all the days 3117 of my appointed time 6635 will I wait, 3176-17 till my change 2487 come. 935-2

14:15 Thou shalt call, 7121-4 and I will answer 6030-4 thee: thou wilt have a desire 3700-4 to the work 4639 of thine hands. 3027

14:16 For now thou numberest 5608-4 my steps: 6806 dost thou not watch 8104-4 over my sin? 2403

14:17 My transgression 6588 [is] sealed up 2856-7 in a bag, 6872 and thou sewest up 2950-4 mine iniquity. 5771

14:18 And surely 199 the mountain 2022 falling 5307-6 cometh to nought, 5034-4 and the rock 6697 is removed 6275-4 out of his place. 4725

14:19 The waters 4325 wear 7833-1 the stones: 68 thou washest away 7857-4 the things which grow 5599 [out] of the dust 6083 of the earth; 776 and thou destroyest 6-52 the hope 8615 of man. 582

14:20 Thou prevailest 8630-4 for ever 5331 against him, and he passeth: 1980-4 thou changest 8138-18 his countenance, 6440 and sendest him away. 7971-17

14:21 His sons 1121 come to honour, 3513-4 and he knoweth 3045-4 [it] not; and they are brought low, 6819-4 but he perceiveth 995-4 [it] not of them.

14:22 But his flesh 1320 upon him shall have pain, 3510-4 and his soul 5315 within him shall mourn. 56-4

15:1 Then answered 6030-4 Eliphaz 464 the Temanite, 8489 and said, 559-4

15:2 Should a wise man 2450 utter 6030-4 vain 7307 knowledge, 1847 and fill 4390-17 his belly 990 with the east wind? 6921

15:3 Should he reason 3198-53 with unprofitable 3808 5532-4 talk? 1697 or with speeches 4405 wherewith he can do no good? 3276-55

15:4 Yea, thou castest off 6565-55 fear, 3374 and restrainest 1639-4 prayer 7881 before 6440 God. 410

15:5 For thy mouth 6310 uttereth 502-17 thine iniquity, 5771 and thou choosest 977-4 the tongue 3956 of the crafty. 6175

15:6 Thine own mouth 6310 condemneth 7561-55 thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips 8193 testify 6030-4 against thee.

15:7 [Art] thou the first 7223|7223-k man 120 [that] was born? 3205-11 or wast thou made 2342-49 before 6440 the hills? 1389

15:8 Hast thou heard 8085-4 the secret 5475 of God? 433 and dost thou restrain 1639-4 wisdom 2451 to thyself?

15:9 What knowest 3045-1 thou, that we know 3045-4 not? [what] understandest 995-4 thou, which [is] not in us?

15:10 With us [are] both the grayheaded 7867-6 and very aged 3453 men, much 3524 elder 3117 than thy father. 1

15:11 [Are] the consolations 8575 of God 410 small 4592 with thee? is there any secret 328 thing 1697 with thee?

15:12 Why doth thine heart 3820 carry thee away? 3947-4 and what do thy eyes 5869 wink at, 7335-4

15:13 That thou turnest 7725-55 thy spirit 7307 against God, 410 and lettest [such] words 4405 go out 3318-52 of thy mouth? 6310

15:14 What [is] man, 582 that he should be clean? 2135-4 and [he which is] born 3205-7 of a woman, 802 that he should be righteous? 6663-4

15:15 Behold, he putteth no trust 539-55 in his saints; 6918 yea, the heavens 8064 are not clean 2141-1 in his sight. 5869

15:16 How much more abominable 8581-12 and filthy 444-12 [is] man, 376 which drinketh 8354-6 iniquity 5766 like water? 4325

15:17 I will shew 2331-17 thee, hear 8085-3 me; and that [which] I have seen 2372-1 I will declare; 5608-17

15:18 Which wise 2450 men have told 5046-55 from their fathers, 1 and have not hid 3582-14 [it]:

15:19 Unto whom alone the earth 776 was given, 5414-8 and no stranger 2114-5 passed 5674-1 among 8432 them.

15:20 The wicked 7563 man travaileth 2342-114 with pain all [his] days, 3117 and the number 4557 of years 8141 is hidden 6845-8 to the oppressor. 6184

15:21 A dreadful 6343 sound 6963 [is] in his ears: 241 in prosperity 7965 the destroyer 7703-6 shall come 935-4 upon him.

15:22 He believeth 539-55 not that he shall return 7725-2 out of darkness, 2822 and he is waited 6822-7 for of the sword. 2719

15:23 He wandereth abroad 5074-6 for bread, 3899 [saying], Where [is it]? he knoweth 3045-1 that the day 3117 of darkness 2822 is ready 3559-12 at his hand. 3027

15:24 Trouble 6862 and anguish 4691 shall make him afraid; 1204-17 they shall prevail 8630-4 against him, as a king 4428 ready 6264 to the battle. 3593

15:25 For he stretcheth out 5186-1 his hand 3027 against God, 410 and strengtheneth 1396-101 himself against the Almighty. 7706

15:26 He runneth 7323-4 upon him, [even] on [his] neck, 6677 upon the thick 5672 bosses 1354 of his bucklers: 4043

15:27 Because he covereth 3680-14 his face 6440 with his fatness, 2459 and maketh 6213-4 collops of fat 6371 on [his] flanks. 3689

15:28 And he dwelleth 7931-4 in desolate 3582-12 cities, 5892 [and] in houses 1004 which no man inhabiteth, 3427-4 which are ready to become 6257-98 heaps. 1530

15:29 He shall not be rich, 6238-4 neither shall his substance 2428 continue, 6965-4 neither shall he prolong 5186-4 the perfection 4512 thereof upon the earth. 776

15:30 He shall not depart 5493-4 out of darkness; 2822 the flame 7957 shall dry up 3001-17 his branches, 3127 and by the breath 7307 of his mouth 6310 shall he go away. 5493-4

15:31 Let not him that is deceived 8582-8 trust 539-55 in vanity: 7723 for vanity 7723 shall be his recompence. 8545

15:32 It shall be accomplished 4390-11 before 3808 his time, 3117 and his branch 3712 shall not be green. 7488

15:33 He shall shake off 2554-4 his unripe grape 1154 as the vine, 1612 and shall cast off 7993-55 his flower 5328 as the olive. 2132

15:34 For the congregation 5712 of hypocrites 2611 [shall be] desolate, 1565 and fire 784 shall consume 398-1 the tabernacles 168 of bribery. 7810

15:35 They conceive 2029-2 mischief, 5999 and bring forth 3205-2 vanity, 205 and their belly 990 prepareth 3559-55 deceit. 4820

16:1 Then Job 347 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4

16:2 I have heard 8085-1 many 7227 such things: miserable 5999 comforters 5162-18 [are] ye all.

16:3 Shall vain 7307 words 1697 have an end? 7093 or what emboldeneth 4834-55 thee that thou answerest? 6030-4

16:4 I also could speak 1696-17 as ye [do]: if 3863 your soul 5315 were 3426 in my soul's 5315 stead, I could heap up 2266-55 words 4405 against you, and shake 5128-55 mine head 7218 at you. 1119

16:5 [But] I would strengthen 553-17 you with 1119 my mouth, 6310 and the moving 5205 of my lips 8193 should asswage 2820-4 [your grief].

16:6 Though I speak, 1696-17 my grief 3511 is not asswaged: 2820-11 and [though] I forbear, 2308-4 what am I eased? 1980-4

16:7 But now he hath made me weary: 3811-52 thou hast made desolate 8074-52 all my company. 5712

16:8 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, 7059-4 [which] is a witness 5707 [against me]: and my leanness 3585 rising up 6965-4 in me beareth witness 6030-4 to my face. 6440

16:9 He teareth 2963-1 [me] in his wrath, 639 who hateth 7852-4 me: he gnasheth 2786-1 upon me with his teeth; 8127 mine enemy 6862 sharpeneth 3913-4 his eyes 5869 upon me.

16:10 They have gaped 6473-1 upon me with their mouth; 6310 they have smitten 5221-52 me upon the cheek 3895 reproachfully; 2781 they have gathered 4390-101 themselves together 3162 against me.

16:11 God 410 hath delivered 5462-55 me to the ungodly, 5760 and turned me over 3399-1 into the hands 3027 of the wicked. 7563

16:12 I was at ease, 7961 but he hath broken me asunder: 6565-46 he hath also taken 270-1 [me] by my neck, 6203 and shaken me to pieces, 6327-46 and set me up 6965-55 for his mark. 4307

16:13 His archers 7228 compass me round about, 5437-4 he cleaveth 6398-17 my reins 3629 asunder, and doth not spare; 2550-4 he poureth out 8210-4 my gall 4845 upon the ground. 776

16:14 He breaketh 6555-4 me with breach 6556 upon 6440 breach, 6556 he runneth 7323-4 upon me like a giant. 1368

16:15 I have sewed 8609-1 sackcloth 8242 upon my skin, 1539 and defiled 5953-22 my horn 7161 in the dust. 6083

16:16 My face 6440 is foul 2560-39 with weeping, 1065 and on my eyelids 6079 [is] the shadow of death; 6757

16:17 Not for [any] injustice 2555 in mine hands: 3709 also my prayer 8605 [is] pure. 2134

16:18 O earth, 776 cover 3680-17 not thou my blood, 1818 and let my cry 2201 have no place. 4725

16:19 Also now, behold, my witness 5707 [is] in heaven, 8064 and my record 7717 [is] on high. 4791

16:20 My friends 7453 scorn 3887-56 me: [but] mine eye 5869 poureth out 1811-1 [tears] unto God. 433

16:21 O that one might plead 3198-55 for a man 1397 with God, 433 as a man 1121 120 [pleadeth] for his neighbour! 7453

16:22 When a few 4557 years 8141 are come, 857-4 then I shall go 1980-4 the way 734 [whence] I shall not return. 7725-4

17:1 My breath 7307 is corrupt, 2254-27 my days 3117 are extinct, 2193-8 the graves 6913 [are ready] for me.

17:2 [Are there] not mockers 2049 with me? and doth not mine eye 5869 continue 3885-4 in their provocation? 4784-53

17:3 Lay down 7760-3 now, put me in a surety 6148-3 with thee; who [is] he [that] will strike 8628-11 hands 3027 with me?

17:4 For thou hast hid 6845-1 their heart 3820 from understanding: 7922 therefore shalt thou not exalt 7311-34 [them].

17:5 He that speaketh 5046-55 flattery 2506 to [his] friends, 7453 even the eyes 5869 of his children 1121 shall fail. 3615-4

17:6 He hath made 3322-52 me also a byword 4914 of the people; 5971 and aforetime 6440 I was as a tabret. 8611

17:7 Mine eye 5869 also is dim 3543-4 by reason of sorrow, 3708 and all my members 3338 [are] as a shadow. 6738

17:8 Upright 3477 [men] shall be astonied 8074-4 at this, and the innocent 5355 shall stir up 5782-113 himself against the hypocrite. 2611

17:9 The righteous 6662 also shall hold on 270-4 his way, 1870 and he that hath clean 2890 hands 3027 shall be 3254-55 stronger and stronger. 555

17:10 But as for 199 you all, do ye return, 7725-4 and come 935-3 now: for I cannot find 4672-4 [one] wise 2450 [man] among you.

17:11 My days 3117 are past, 5674-1 my purposes 2154 are broken off, 5423-8 [even] the thoughts 4180 of my heart. 3824

17:12 They change 7760-4 the night 3915 into day: 3117 the light 216 [is] short 7138 because 6440 of darkness. 2822

17:13 If I wait, 6960-17 the grave 7585 [is] mine house: 1004 I have made 7502-14 my bed 3326 in the darkness. 2822

17:14 I have said 7121-1 to corruption, 7845 Thou [art] my father: 1 to the worm, 7415 [Thou art] my mother, 517 and my sister. 269

17:15 And where [is] now 645 my hope? 8615 as for my hope, 8615 who shall see 7789-4 it?

17:16 They shall go down 3381-4 to the bars 905 of the pit, 7585 when [our] rest 5183 together 3162 [is] in the dust. 6083

18:1 Then answered 6030-4 Bildad 1085 the Shuhite, 7747 and said, 559-4

18:2 How long 5704 [will it be ere] ye make 7760-4 an end 7078 of words? 4405 mark, 995-4 and afterwards 310 we will speak. 1696-17

18:3 Wherefore are we counted 2803-8 as beasts, 929 [and] reputed vile 2933-8 in your sight? 5869

18:4 He teareth 2963-6 himself 5315 in his anger: 639 shall the earth 776 be forsaken 5800-11 for thee? and shall the rock 6697 be removed 6275-4 out of his place? 4725

18:5 Yea, the light 216 of the wicked 7563 shall be put out, 1846-4 and the spark 7632 of his fire 784 shall not shine. 5050-4

18:6 The light 216 shall be dark 2821-1 in his tabernacle, 168 and his candle 5216 shall be put out 1846-4 with him.

18:7 The steps 6806 of his strength 202 shall be straitened, 3334-4 and his own counsel 6098 shall cast him down. 7993-55

18:8 For he is cast 7971-27 into a net 7568 by his own feet, 7272 and he walketh 1980-101 upon a snare. 7639

18:9 The gin 6341 shall take 270-4 [him] by the heel, 6119 [and] the robber 6782 shall prevail 2388-55 against him.

18:10 The snare 2256 [is] laid 2934-7 for him in the ground, 776 and a trap 4434 for him in the way. 5410

18:11 Terrors 1091 shall make him afraid 1204-14 on every side, 5439 and shall drive 6327-52 him to his feet. 7272

18:12 His strength 202 shall be hungerbitten, 7457 and destruction 343 [shall be] ready 3559-12 at his side. 6763

18:13 It shall devour 398-4 the strength 905 of his skin: 5785 [even] the firstborn 1060 of death 4194 shall devour 398-4 his strength. 905

18:14 His confidence 4009 shall be rooted out 5423-11 of his tabernacle, 168 and it shall bring 6805-55 him to the king 4428 of terrors. 1091

18:15 It shall dwell 7931-4 in his tabernacle, 168 because [it is] none 1097 of his: brimstone 1614 shall be scattered 2219-29 upon his habitation. 5116

18:16 His roots 8328 shall be dried up 3001-4 beneath, and above 4605 shall his branch 7105 be cut off. 5243-4

18:17 His remembrance 2143 shall perish 6-1 from the earth, 776 and he shall have no name 8034 in 6440 the street. 2351

18:18 He shall be driven 1920-4 from light 216 into darkness, 2822 and chased 5074-55 out of the world. 8398

18:19 He shall neither have son 5209 nor nephew 5220 among his people, 5971 nor any remaining 8300 in his dwellings. 4033

18:20 They that come after 314 [him] shall be astonied 8074-8 at his day, 3117 as they that went before 6931 were affrighted. 270-1 8178

18:21 Surely such [are] the dwellings 4908 of the wicked, 5767 and this [is] the place 4725 [of him that] knoweth 3045-1 not God. 410

19:1 Then Job 347 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4

19:2 How long will ye vex 3013-55 my soul, 5315 and break 1792-17 me in pieces with words? 4405

19:3 These ten 6235 times 6471 have ye reproached 3637-55 me: ye are not ashamed 954-4 [that] ye make yourselves strange 1970-55 to me.

19:4 And be it indeed 551 [that] I have erred, 7686-1 mine error 4879 remaineth 3885-4 with myself.

19:5 If indeed 551 ye will magnify 1431-55 [yourselves] against me, and plead 3198-55 against me my reproach: 2781

19:6 Know 3045-3 now 645 that God 433 hath overthrown 5791-14 me, and hath compassed 5362-52 me with his net. 4686

19:7 Behold, I cry out 6817-4 of wrong, 2555 but I am not heard: 6030-11 I cry aloud, 7768-17 but [there is] no judgment. 4941

19:8 He hath fenced up 1443-1 my way 734 that I cannot pass, 5674-4 and he hath set 7760-4 darkness 2822 in my paths. 5410

19:9 He hath stripped 6584-52 me of my glory, 3519 and taken 5493-55 the crown 5850 [from] my head. 7218

19:10 He hath destroyed 5422-4 me on every side, 5439 and I am gone: 3212-4 and mine hope 8615 hath he removed 5265-55 like a tree. 6086

19:11 He hath also kindled 2734-55 his wrath 639 against me, and he counteth 2803-4 me unto him as [one of] his enemies. 6862

19:12 His troops 1416 come 935-4 together, 3162 and raise up 5549-4 their way 1870 against me, and encamp 2583-4 round about 5439 my tabernacle. 168

19:13 He hath put my brethren 251 far 7368-52 from me, and mine acquaintance 3045-6 are verily estranged 2114-1 from me.

19:14 My kinsfolk 7138 have failed, 2308-1 and my familiar friends 3045-30 have forgotten 7911-1 me.

19:15 They that dwell 1481-6 in mine house, 1004 and my maids, 519 count 2803-4 me for a stranger: 2114-5 I am an alien 5237 in their sight. 5869

19:16 I called 7121-1 my servant, 5650 and he gave [me] no answer; 6030-4 I intreated 2603-101 him with 1119 my mouth. 6310

19:17 My breath 7307 is strange 2114-1 to my wife, 802 though I intreated 2589-2 for the children's 1121 [sake] of mine own body. 990

19:18 Yea, young children 5759 despised 3988-1 me; I arose, 6965-4 and they spake 1696-17 against me.

19:19 All my inward 5475 friends 4962 abhorred 8581-14 me: and they whom I loved 157-1 are turned 2015-8 against me.

19:20 My bone 6106 cleaveth 1692-1 to my skin 5785 and to my flesh, 1320 and I am escaped 4422-101 with the skin 5785 of my teeth. 8127

19:21 Have pity 2603-3 upon me, have pity 2603-3 upon me, O ye my friends; 7453 for the hand 3027 of God 433 hath touched 5060-1 me.

19:22 Why do ye persecute 7291-4 me as God, 410 and are not satisfied 7646-4 with my flesh? 1320

19:23 Oh that 5414-4 my words 4405 were now 645 written! 3789-11 oh that 5414-4 they were printed 2710-93 in a book! 5612

19:24 That they were graven 2672-11 with an iron 1270 pen 5842 and lead 5777 in the rock 6697 for ever! 5703

19:25 For I know 3045-1 [that] my redeemer 1350-6 liveth, 2416 and [that] he shall stand 6965-4 at the latter 314 [day] upon the earth: 6083

19:26 And [though] after 310 my skin 5785 [worms] destroy 5362-14 this [body], yet in my flesh 1320 shall I see 2372-4 God: 433

19:27 Whom I shall see 2372-4 for myself, and mine eyes 5869 shall behold, 7200-1 and not another; 2114-5 [though] my reins 3629 be consumed 3615-1 within 2436 me.

19:28 But ye should say, 559-4 Why persecute 7291-4 we him, seeing the root 8328 of the matter 1697 is found 4672-8 in me?

19:29 Be ye afraid 1481-3 of 6440 the sword: 2719 for wrath 2534 [bringeth] the punishments 5771 of the sword, 2719 that ye may know 3045-4 [there is] a judgment. 1779|1779-k

20:1 Then answered 6030-4 Zophar 6691 the Naamathite, 5284 and said, 559-4

20:2 Therefore do my thoughts 5587 cause me to answer, 7725-55 and for [this] I make haste. 2363-2

20:3 I have heard 8085-4 the check 4148 of my reproach, 3639 and the spirit 7307 of my understanding 998 causeth me to answer. 6030-4

20:4 Knowest 3045-1 thou [not] this of old, 5703 since man 120 was placed 7760-2 upon earth, 776

20:5 That the triumphing 7445 of the wicked 7563 [is] short, 7138 and the joy 8057 of the hypocrite 2611 [but] for a moment? 7281

20:6 Though his excellency 7863 mount up 5927-4 to the heavens, 8064 and his head 7218 reach 5060-55 unto the clouds; 5645

20:7 [Yet] he shall perish 6-4 for ever 5331 like his own dung: 1561 they which have seen 7200-6 him shall say, 559-4 Where [is] he? 335

20:8 He shall fly away 5774-4 as a dream, 2472 and shall not be found: 4672-4 yea, he shall be chased away 5074-93 as a vision 2384 of the night. 3915

20:9 The eye 5869 also [which] saw 7805-1 him shall [see him] no more; 3254-55 neither shall his place 4725 any more behold 7789-4 him.

20:10 His children 1121 shall seek to please 7521-17 the poor, 1800 and his hands 3027 shall restore 7725-55 their goods. 202

20:11 His bones 6106 are full 4390-1 [of the sin] of his youth, 5934 which shall lie down 7901-4 with him in the dust. 6083

20:12 Though wickedness 7451 be sweet 4985-55 in his mouth, 6310 [though] he hide 3582-55 it under his tongue; 3956

20:13 [Though] he spare 2550-4 it, and forsake 5800-4 it not; but keep it 4513-4 still within 8432 his mouth: 2441

20:14 [Yet] his meat 3899 in his bowels 4578 is turned, 2015-8 [it is] the gall 4846 of asps 6620 within 7130 him.

20:15 He hath swallowed down 1104-1 riches, 2428 and he shall vomit 6958-55 them up again: God 410 shall cast them out 3423-55 of his belly. 990

20:16 He shall suck 3243-4 the poison 7219 of asps: 6620 the viper's 660 tongue 3956 shall slay 2026-4 him.

20:17 He shall not see 7200-4 the rivers, 6390 the floods, 5104 the brooks 5158 of honey 1706 and butter. 2529

20:18 That which he laboured 3022 for shall he restore, 7725-56 and shall not swallow [it] down: 1104-4 according to [his] substance 2428 [shall] the restitution 8545 [be], and he shall not rejoice 5965-4 [therein].

20:19 Because he hath oppressed 7533-14 [and] hath forsaken 5800-1 the poor; 1800 [because] he hath violently taken away 1497-1 an house 1004 which he builded 1129-4 not;

20:20 Surely he shall not feel 3045-1 quietness 7961 in his belly, 990 he shall not save 4422-17 of that which he desired. 2530-7

20:21 There shall none of his meat 400 be left; 8300 therefore shall no man look 2342-4 for his goods. 2898

20:22 In the fulness 4390-2|4390-15-k of his sufficiency 5607 he shall be in straits: 3334-4 every hand 3027 of the wicked 6001 shall come 935-4 upon him.

20:23 [When] he is about to fill 4390-15 his belly, 990 [God] shall cast 7971-17 the fury 2740 of his wrath 639 upon him, and shall rain 4305-55 [it] upon him while he is eating. 3894

20:24 He shall flee 1272-4 from the iron 1270 weapon, 5402 [and] the bow 7198 of steel 5154 shall strike him through. 2498-4

20:25 It is drawn, 8025-1 and cometh out 3318-4 of the body; 1465 yea, the glittering 1300 sword cometh out 1980-4 of his gall: 4846 terrors 367 [are] upon him.

20:26 All darkness 2822 [shall be] hid 2934-7 in his secret places: 6845-7 a fire 784 not blown 5301-27 shall consume 398-17 him; it shall go ill 3415-4 with him that is left 8300 in his tabernacle. 168

20:27 The heaven 8064 shall reveal 1540-17 his iniquity; 5771 and the earth 776 shall rise up 6965-102 against him.

20:28 The increase 2981 of his house 1004 shall depart, 1540-4 [and his goods] shall flow away 5064-12 in the day 3117 of his wrath. 639

20:29 This [is] the portion 2506 of a wicked 7563 man 120 from God, 430 and the heritage 5159 appointed 561 unto him by God. 410

21:1 But Job 347 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4

21:2 Hear 8085-3 diligently 8085-2 my speech, 4405 and let this be your consolations. 8575

21:3 Suffer 5375-3 me that I may speak; 1696-17 and after 310 that I have spoken, 1696-15 mock on. 3932-55

21:4 As for me, [is] my complaint 7879 to man? 120 and if [it were so], why should not my spirit 7307 be troubled? 7114-4

21:5 Mark 6437-3 me, and be astonished, 8074-92 and lay 7760-3 [your] hand 3027 upon [your] mouth. 6310

21:6 Even when I remember 2142-1 I am afraid, 926-8 and trembling 6427 taketh hold 270-1 on my flesh. 1320

21:7 Wherefore do the wicked 7563 live, 2421-4 become old, 6275-1 yea, are mighty 1396-1 in power? 2428

21:8 Their seed 2233 is established 3559-12 in their sight 6440 with them, and their offspring 6631 before their eyes. 5869

21:9 Their houses 1004 [are] safe 7965 from fear, 6343 neither [is] the rod 7626 of God 433 upon them.

21:10 Their bull 7794 gendereth, 5674-14 and faileth 1602-55 not; their cow 6510 calveth, 6403-17 and casteth not her calf. 7921-17

21:11 They send forth 7971-17 their little ones 5759 like a flock, 6629 and their children 3206 dance. 7540-17

21:12 They take 5375-4 the timbrel 8596 and harp, 3658 and rejoice 8055-4 at the sound 6963 of the organ. 5748

21:13 They spend 3615-17|1086-17-k their days 3117 in wealth, 2896 and in a moment 7281 go down 2865-11|5181-4-q to the grave. 7585

21:14 Therefore they say 559-4 unto God, 410 Depart 5493-3 from us; for we desire 2654-1 not the knowledge 1847 of thy ways. 1870

21:15 What [is] the Almighty, 7706 that we should serve 5647-4 him? and what profit 3276-55 should we have, if we pray 6293-4 unto him?

21:16 Lo, their good 2898 [is] not in their hand: 3027 the counsel 6098 of the wicked 7563 is far 7368-1 from me.

21:17 How oft is the candle 5216 of the wicked 7563 put out! 1846-4 and [how oft] cometh 935-4 their destruction 343 upon them! [God] distributeth 2505-17 sorrows 2256 in his anger. 639

21:18 They are as stubble 8401 before 6440 the wind, 7307 and as chaff 4671 that the storm 5492 carrieth away. 1589-1

21:19 God 433 layeth up 6845-4 his iniquity 205 for his children: 1121 he rewardeth 7999-17 him, and he shall know 3045-4 [it].

21:20 His eyes 5869 shall see 7200-4 his destruction, 3589 and he shall drink 8354-4 of the wrath 2534 of the Almighty. 7706

21:21 For what pleasure 2656 [hath] he in his house 1004 after 310 him, when the number 4557 of his months 2320 is cut off in the midst? 2686-27

21:22 Shall [any] teach 3925-17 God 410 knowledge? 1847 seeing he judgeth 8199-4 those that are high. 7311-6

21:23 One dieth 4191-4 in his full 8537 strength, 6106 being wholly at ease 7946 and quiet. 7961

21:24 His breasts 5845 are full 4390-1 of milk, 2461 and his bones 6106 are moistened 8248-29 with marrow. 4221

21:25 And another dieth 4191-4 in the bitterness 4751 of his soul, 5315 and never eateth 398-1 with pleasure. 2896

21:26 They shall lie down 7901-4 alike 3162 in the dust, 6083 and the worms 7415 shall cover 3680-17 them.

21:27 Behold, I know 3045-1 your thoughts, 4284 and the devices 4209 [which] ye wrongfully imagine 2554-4 against me.

21:28 For ye say, 559-4 Where [is] the house 1004 of the prince? 5081 and where [are] the dwelling 4908 places 168 of the wicked? 7563

21:29 Have ye not asked 7592-1 them that go by 5674-6 the way? 1870 and do ye not know 5234-17 their tokens, 226

21:30 That the wicked 7451 is reserved 2820-11 to the day 3117 of destruction? 343 they shall be brought forth 2986-93 to the day 3117 of wrath. 5678

21:31 Who shall declare 5046-55 his way 1870 to his face? 6440 and who shall repay 7999-17 him [what] he hath done? 6213-1

21:32 Yet shall he be brought 2986-93 to the grave, 6913 and shall remain 8245-4 in the tomb. 1430

21:33 The clods 7263 of the valley 5158 shall be sweet 4985-1 unto him, and every man 120 shall draw 4900-4 after 310 him, as [there are] innumerable 369 4557 before 6440 him.

21:34 How then comfort 5162-17 ye me in vain, 1892 seeing in your answers 8666 there remaineth 7604-8 falsehood? 4604

22:1 Then Eliphaz 464 the Temanite 8489 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4

22:2 Can a man 1397 be profitable 5532-4 unto God, 410 as 3588 he that is wise 7919-56 may be profitable 5532-4 unto himself?

22:3 [Is it] any pleasure 2656 to the Almighty, 7706 that thou art righteous? 6663-4 or [is it] gain 1215 [to him], that thou makest thy ways 1870 perfect? 8552-55

22:4 Will he reprove 3198-55 thee for fear 3374 of thee? will he enter 935-4 with thee into judgment? 4941

22:5 [Is] not thy wickedness 7451 great? 7227 and thine iniquities 5771 infinite? 7093

22:6 For thou hast taken a pledge 2254-4 from thy brother 251 for nought, 2600 and stripped 6584-55 the naked 6174 of their clothing. 899

22:7 Thou hast not given water 4325 to the weary 5889 to drink, 8248-55 and thou hast withholden 4513-4 bread 3899 from the hungry. 7457

22:8 But [as for] the mighty 2220 man, 376 he had the earth; 776 and the honourable 5375-7 6440 man dwelt 3427-4 in it.

22:9 Thou hast sent 7971-14 widows 490 away empty, 7387 and the arms 2220 of the fatherless 3490 have been broken. 1792-29

22:10 Therefore snares 6341 [are] round about 5439 thee, and sudden 6597 fear 6343 troubleth 926-17 thee;

22:11 Or darkness, 2822 [that] thou canst not see; 7200-4 and abundance 8229 of waters 4325 cover 3680-17 thee.

22:12 [Is] not God 433 in the height 1363 of heaven? 8064 and behold 7200-3 the height 7218 of the stars, 3556 how high 7311-1 they are!

22:13 And thou sayest, 559-1 How doth God 410 know? 3045-1 can he judge 8199-4 through the dark cloud? 6205

22:14 Thick clouds 5645 [are] a covering 5643 to him, that he seeth 7200-4 not; and he walketh 1980-101 in the circuit 2329 of heaven. 8064

22:15 Hast thou marked 8104-4 the old 5769 way 734 which wicked 205 men 4962 have trodden? 1869-1

22:16 Which were cut down 7059-27 out of time, 6256 whose foundation 3247 was overflown 3332-93 with a flood: 5104

22:17 Which said 559-6 unto God, 410 Depart 5493-3 from us: and what can the Almighty 7706 do 6466-4 for them?

22:18 Yet he filled 4390-14 their houses 1004 with good 2896 [things]: but the counsel 6098 of the wicked 7563 is far 7368-1 from me.

22:19 The righteous 6662 see 7200-4 [it], and are glad: 8055-4 and the innocent 5355 laugh them to scorn. 3932-4

22:20 Whereas 518 our substance 7009 is not cut down, 3582-8 but the remnant 3499 of them the fire 784 consumeth. 398-1

22:21 Acquaint 5532-54 now thyself with him, and be at peace: 7999-3 thereby good 2896 shall come 935-4 unto thee.

22:22 Receive, 3947-3 I pray thee, the law 8451 from his mouth, 6310 and lay up 7760-3 his words 561 in thine heart. 3824

22:23 If thou return 7725-4 to the Almighty, 7706 thou shalt be built up, 1129-11 thou shalt put away iniquity 5766 far 7368-55 from thy tabernacles. 168

22:24 Then shalt thou lay up 7896-2 gold 1220 as 5921 dust, 6083 and the [gold] of Ophir 211 as the stones 6697 of the brooks. 5158

22:25 Yea, the Almighty 7706 shall be thy defence, 1220 and thou shalt have plenty 8443 of silver. 3701

22:26 For then shalt thou have thy delight 6026-101 in the Almighty, 7706 and shalt lift up 5375-4 thy face 6440 unto God. 433

22:27 Thou shalt make thy prayer 6279-55 unto him, and he shall hear 8085-4 thee, and thou shalt pay 7999-17 thy vows. 5088

22:28 Thou shalt also decree 1504-4 a thing, 562 and it shall be established 6965-4 unto thee: and the light 216 shall shine 5050-1 upon thy ways. 1870

22:29 When [men] are cast down, 8213-52 then thou shalt say, 559-4 [There is] lifting up; 1466 and he shall save 3467-55 the humble 7807 5869 person.

22:30 He shall deliver 4422-17 the island 336 of the innocent: 5355 and it is delivered 4422-8 by the pureness 1252 of thine hands. 3709

23:1 Then Job 347 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4

23:2 Even to day 3117 [is] my complaint 7879 bitter: 4805 my stroke 3027 is heavier 3513-1 than my groaning. 585

23:3 Oh that 5414-4 I knew 3045-1 where I might find 4672-4 him! [that] I might come 935-4 [even] to his seat! 8499

23:4 I would order 6186-4 [my] cause 4941 before 6440 him, and fill 4390-17 my mouth 6310 with arguments. 8433

23:5 I would know 3045-4 the words 4405 [which] he would answer 6030-4 me, and understand 995-4 what he would say 559-4 unto me.

23:6 Will he plead 7378-4 against me 5978 with [his] great 7230 power? 3581 No; but he would put 7760-4 [strength] in me.

23:7 There the righteous 3477 might dispute 3198-12 with him; so should I be delivered 6403-17 for ever 5331 from my judge. 8199-6

23:8 Behold, I go 1980-4 forward, 6924 but he [is] not [there]; and backward, 268 but I cannot perceive 995-4 him:

23:9 On the left hand, 8040 where he doth work, 6213-2 but I cannot behold 2372-4 [him]: he hideth 5848-4 himself on the right hand, 3225 that I cannot see 7200-4 [him]:

23:10 But he knoweth 3045-1 the way 1870 that I take: 5978 [when] he hath tried 974-1 me, I shall come forth 3318-4 as gold. 2091

23:11 My foot 7272 hath held 270-1 his steps, 838 his way 1870 have I kept, 8104-1 and not declined. 5186-55

23:12 Neither have I gone back 4185-55 from the commandment 4687 of his lips; 8193 I have esteemed 6845-1 the words 561 of his mouth 6310 more than my necessary 2706 [food].

23:13 But he [is] in one 259 [mind], and who can turn 7725-55 him? and [what] his soul 5315 desireth, 183-14 even [that] he doeth. 6213-4

23:14 For he performeth 7999-55 [the thing that is] appointed 2706 for me: and many 7227 such 2007 [things are] with him.

23:15 Therefore am I troubled 926-11 at his presence: 6440 when I consider, 995-113 I am afraid 6342-4 of him.

23:16 For God 410 maketh my heart 3820 soft, 7401-52 and the Almighty 7706 troubleth 926-52 me:

23:17 Because I was not cut off 6789-8 before 6440 the darkness, 2822 [neither] hath he covered 3680-14 the darkness 652 from my face. 6440

24:1 Why, seeing times 6256 are not hidden 6845-8 from the Almighty, 7706 do they that know 3045-6 him not see 2372-1 his days? 3117

24:2 [Some] remove 5381-55 the landmarks; 1367 they violently take away 1497-1 flocks, 5739 and feed 7462-4 [thereof].

24:3 They drive away 5090-4 the ass 2543 of the fatherless, 3490 they take the widow's 490 ox 7794 for a pledge. 2254-4

24:4 They turn 5186-55 the needy 34 out of the way: 1870 the poor 6041|6035-k of the earth 776 hide 2244-27 themselves together. 3162

24:5 Behold, [as] wild asses 6501 in the desert, 4057 go they forth 3318-1 to their work; 6467 rising betimes 7836-18 for a prey: 2964 the wilderness 6160 [yieldeth] food 3899 for them [and] for [their] children. 5288

24:6 They reap 7114-4|7114-55-k [every one] his corn 1098 in the field: 7704 and they gather 3953-17 the vintage 3754 of the wicked. 7563

24:7 They cause the naked 6174 to lodge 3885-55 without clothing, 3830 that [they have] no covering 3682 in the cold. 7135

24:8 They are wet 7372-4 with the showers 2230 of the mountains, 2022 and embrace 2263-14 the rock 6697 for want of a shelter. 4268

24:9 They pluck 1497-4 the fatherless 3490 from the breast, 7699 and take a pledge 2254-4 of the poor. 6041

24:10 They cause [him] to go 1980-14 naked 6174 without clothing, 3830 and they take away 5375-1 the sheaf 6016 [from] the hungry; 7457

24:11 [Which] make oil 6671-55 within 996 their walls, 7791 [and] tread 1869-1 [their] winepresses, 3342 and suffer thirst. 6770-4

24:12 Men 4962 groan 5008-4 from out of the city, 5892 and the soul 5315 of the wounded 2491 crieth out: 7768-17 yet God 433 layeth 7760-4 not folly 8604 [to them].

24:13 They are of those that rebel 4775-6 against the light; 216 they know 5234-52 not the ways 1870 thereof, nor abide 3427-1 in the paths 5410 thereof.

24:14 The murderer 7523-6 rising 6965-4 with the light 216 killeth 6991-4 the poor 6041 and needy, 34 and in the night 3915 is as a thief. 1590

24:15 The eye 5869 also of the adulterer 5003-6 waiteth 8104-1 for the twilight, 5399 saying, 559-2 No eye 5869 shall see 7789-4 me: and disguiseth 5643 7760-4 [his] face. 6440

24:16 In the dark 2822 they dig through 2864-1 houses, 1004 [which] they had marked 2856-14 for themselves in the daytime: 3119 they know 3045-1 not the light. 216

24:17 For the morning 1242 [is] to them even as 3162 the shadow of death: 6757 if [one] know 5234-55 [them, they are in] the terrors 1091 of the shadow of death. 6757

24:18 He [is] swift 7031 as 6440 the waters; 4325 their portion 2513 is cursed 7043-29 in the earth: 776 he beholdeth 6437-4 not the way 1870 of the vineyards. 3754

24:19 Drought 6723 and heat 2527 consume 1497-4 the snow 7950 waters: 4325 [so doth] the grave 7585 [those which] have sinned. 2398-1

24:20 The womb 7358 shall forget 7911-4 him; the worm 7415 shall feed sweetly 4988-1 on him; he shall be no more remembered; 2142-11 and wickedness 5766 shall be broken 7665-11 as a tree. 6086

24:21 He evil entreateth 7462-6 the barren 6135 [that] beareth 3205-4 not: and doeth not good 3190-55 to the widow. 490

24:22 He draweth 4900-1 also the mighty 47 with his power: 3581 he riseth up, 6965-4 and no [man] is sure 539-55 of life. 2416

24:23 [Though] it be given 5414-4 him [to be] in safety, 983 whereon he resteth; 8172-11 yet his eyes 5869 [are] upon their ways. 1870

24:24 They are exalted 7426-1 for a little while, 4592 but are gone and brought low; 4355-90 they are taken out of the way 7092-11 as all [other], and cut off 5243-4 as the tops 7218 of the ears of corn. 7641

24:25 And if [it be] not [so] now, 645 who will make me a liar, 3576-55 and make 7760-4 my speech 4405 nothing worth? 408

25:1 Then answered 6030-4 Bildad 1085 the Shuhite, 7747 and said, 559-4

25:2 Dominion 4910-53 and fear 6343 [are] with him, he maketh 6213-6 peace 7965 in his high places. 4791

25:3 Is there 3426 any number 4557 of his armies? 1416 and upon whom doth not his light 216 arise? 6965-4

25:4 How then can man 582 be justified 6663-4 with God? 410 or how can he be clean 2135-4 [that is] born 3205-7 of a woman? 802

25:5 Behold even to the moon, 3394 and it shineth 166-55 not; yea, the stars 3556 are not pure 2141-1 in his sight. 5869

25:6 How much less man, 582 [that is] a worm? 7415 and the son 1121 of man, 120 [which is] a worm? 8438

26:1 But Job 347 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4

26:2 How hast thou helped 5826-1 [him that is] without 3808 power? 3581 [how] savest 3467-52 thou the arm 2220 [that hath] no 3808 strength? 5797

26:3 How hast thou counselled 3289-1 [him that hath] no 3808 wisdom? 2451 and [how] hast thou plentifully 7230 declared 3045-52 the thing as it is? 8454

26:4 To whom hast thou uttered 5046-52 words? 4405 and whose spirit 5397 came 3318-1 from thee?

26:5 Dead 7496 [things] are formed 2342-34 from under the waters, 4325 and the inhabitants 7931-6 thereof.

26:6 Hell 7585 [is] naked 6174 before him, and destruction 11 hath no covering. 3682

26:7 He stretcheth out 5186-6 the north 6828 over the empty place, 8414 [and] hangeth 8518-6 the earth 776 upon nothing. 1099

26:8 He bindeth up 6887-6 the waters 4325 in his thick clouds; 5645 and the cloud 6051 is not rent 1234-8 under them.

26:9 He holdeth back 270-18 the face 6440 of his throne, 3678 [and] spreadeth 6576-40 his cloud 6051 upon it.

26:10 He hath compassed 2328-1 the 6440 waters 4325 with bounds, 2706 until the day 216 and night 2822 come to an end. 8503

26:11 The pillars 5982 of heaven 8064 tremble 7322-34 and are astonished 8539-4 at his reproof. 1606

26:12 He divideth 7280-1 the sea 3220 with his power, 3581 and by his understanding 8394 he smiteth 4272-1 through the proud. 7293

26:13 By his spirit 7307 he hath garnished 8235-14 the heavens; 8064 his hand 3027 hath formed 2342-31 the crooked 1281 serpent. 5175

26:14 Lo, these [are] parts 7098 of his ways: 1870 but how little 8102 a portion 1697 is heard 8085-8 of him? but the thunder 7482 of his power 1369 who can understand? 995-113

27:1 Moreover Job 347 continued 3254-55 5375-2 his parable, 4912 and said, 559-4

27:2 [As] God 410 liveth, 2416 [who] hath taken away 5493-52 my judgment; 4941 and the Almighty, 7706 [who] hath vexed 4843-52 my soul; 5315

27:3 All the while 5750 my breath 5397 [is] in me, and the spirit 7307 of God 433 [is] in my nostrils; 639

27:4 My lips 8193 shall not speak 1696-17 wickedness, 5766 nor my tongue 3956 utter 1897-4 deceit. 7423

27:5 God forbid 2486 that I should justify 6663-55 you: till I die 1478-4 I will not remove 5493-55 mine integrity 8538 from me.

27:6 My righteousness 6666 I hold 2388-52 fast, and will not let it go: 7503-55 my heart 3824 shall not reproach 2778-4 [me] so long as I live. 3117

27:7 Let mine enemy 341-6 be as the wicked, 7563 and he that riseth up 6965-102 against me as the unrighteous. 5767

27:8 For what [is] the hope 8615 of the hypocrite, 2611 though he hath gained, 1214-4 when God 433 taketh away 7953-4 his soul? 5315

27:9 Will God 410 hear 8085-4 his cry 6818 when trouble 6869 cometh 935-4 upon him?

27:10 Will he delight 6026-101 himself in the Almighty? 7706 will he always 6256 call 7121-4 upon God? 433

27:11 I will teach 3384-55 you by the hand 3027 of God: 410 [that] which [is] with the Almighty 7706 will I not conceal. 3582-17

27:12 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen 2372-1 [it]; why then are ye thus altogether 1892 vain? 1891-4

27:13 This [is] the portion 2506 of a wicked 7563 man 120 with God, 410 and the heritage 5159 of oppressors, 6184 [which] they shall receive 3947-4 of the Almighty. 7706

27:14 If his children 1121 be multiplied, 7235-4 [it is] for 3926 the sword: 2719 and his offspring 6631 shall not be satisfied 7646-4 with bread. 3899

27:15 Those that remain 8300 of him shall be buried 6912-11 in death: 4194 and his widows 490 shall not weep. 1058-4

27:16 Though he heap up 6651-4 silver 3701 as the dust, 6083 and prepare 3559-55 raiment 4403 as the clay; 2563

27:17 He may prepare 3559-55 [it], but the just 6662 shall put [it] on, 3847-4 and the innocent 5355 shall divide 2505-4 the silver. 3701

27:18 He buildeth 1129-1 his house 1004 as a moth, 6211 and as a booth 5521 [that] the keeper 5341-6 maketh. 6213-1

27:19 The rich 6223 man shall lie down, 7901-4 but he shall not be gathered: 622-11 he openeth 6491-1 his eyes, 5869 and he [is] not.

27:20 Terrors 1091 take hold 5381-55 on him as waters, 4325 a tempest 5492 stealeth him away 1589-1 in the night. 3915

27:21 The east wind 6921 carrieth him away, 5375-4 and he departeth: 3212-4 and as a storm hurleth 8175-17 him out of his place. 4725

27:22 For [God] shall cast 7993-55 upon him, and not spare: 2550-4 he would fain 1272-2 flee 1272-4 out of his hand. 3027

27:23 [Men] shall clap 5606-4 their hands 3709 at him, and shall hiss 8319-4 him out of his place. 4725

28:1 Surely there is 3426 a vein 4161 for the silver, 3701 and a place 4725 for gold 2091 [where] they fine 2212-4 [it].

28:2 Iron 1270 is taken 3947-93 out of the earth, 6083 and brass 5154 [is] molten 6694-4 [out of] the stone. 68

28:3 He setteth 7760-1 an end 7093 to darkness, 2822 and searcheth out 2713-6 all perfection: 8503 the stones 68 of darkness, 652 and the shadow of death. 6757

28:4 The flood 5158 breaketh out 6555-1 from the inhabitant; 1481-6 [even the waters] forgotten 7911-12 of the foot: 7272 they are dried up, 1809-1 they are gone away 5128-1 from men. 582

28:5 [As for] the earth, 776 out of it cometh 3318-4 bread: 3899 and under it is turned up 2015-8 as it were fire. 784

28:6 The stones 68 of it [are] the place 4725 of sapphires: 5601 and it hath dust 6083 of gold. 2091

28:7 [There is] a path 5410 which no fowl 5861 knoweth, 3045-1 and which the vulture's 344 eye 5869 hath not seen: 7805-1

28:8 The lion's 7830 whelps 1121 have not trodden 1869-52 it, nor the fierce lion 7826 passed 5710-1 by it.

28:9 He putteth forth 7971-1 his hand 3027 upon the rock; 2496 he overturneth 2015-1 the mountains 2022 by the roots. 8328

28:10 He cutteth out 1234-14 rivers 2975 among the rocks; 6697 and his eye 5869 seeth 7200-1 every precious thing. 3366

28:11 He bindeth 2280-14 the floods 5104 from overflowing; 1065 and [the thing that is] hid 8587 bringeth he forth 3318-55 to light. 216

28:12 But where 370 shall wisdom 2451 be found? 4672-11 and where [is] the place 4725 of understanding? 998

28:13 Man 582 knoweth 3045-1 not the price 6187 thereof; neither is it found 4672-11 in the land 776 of the living. 2416

28:14 The depth 8415 saith, 559-1 It [is] not in me: and the sea 3220 saith, 559-1 [It is] not with me.

28:15 It cannot be gotten 5414-93 for gold, 5458 neither shall silver 3701 be weighed 8254-11 [for] the price 4242 thereof.

28:16 It cannot be valued 5541-29 with the gold 3800 of Ophir, 211 with the precious 3368 onyx, 7718 or the sapphire. 5601

28:17 The gold 2091 and the crystal 2137 cannot equal 6186-4 it: and the exchange 8545 of it [shall not be for] jewels 3627 of fine gold. 6337

28:18 No mention 2142-11 shall be made of coral, 7215 or of pearls: 1378 for the price 4901 of wisdom 2451 [is] above rubies. 6443

28:19 The topaz 6357 of Ethiopia 3568 shall not equal 6186-4 it, neither shall it be valued 5541-29 with pure 2889 gold. 3800

28:20 Whence 370 then cometh 935-4 wisdom? 2451 and where [is] the place 4725 of understanding? 998

28:21 Seeing it is hid 5956-8 from the eyes 5869 of all living, 2416 and kept close 5641-8 from the fowls 5775 of the air. 8064

28:22 Destruction 11 and death 4194 say, 559-1 We have heard 8085-1 the fame 8088 thereof with our ears. 241

28:23 God 430 understandeth 995-52 the way 1870 thereof, and he knoweth 3045-1 the place 4725 thereof.

28:24 For he looketh 5027-55 to the ends 7098 of the earth, 776 [and] seeth 7200-4 under the whole heaven; 8064

28:25 To make 6213-2 the weight 4948 for the winds; 7307 and he weigheth 8505-14 the waters 4325 by measure. 4060

28:26 When he made 6213-2 a decree 2706 for the rain, 4306 and a way 1870 for the lightning 2385 of the thunder: 6963

28:27 Then did he see 7200-1 it, and declare 5608-17 it; he prepared 3559-52 it, yea, and searched it out. 2713-1

28:28 And unto man 120 he said, 559-4 Behold, the fear 3374 of the Lord, 136 that [is] wisdom; 2451 and to depart 5493-2 from evil 7451 [is] understanding. 998

29:1 Moreover Job 347 continued 3254-55 5375-2 his parable, 4912 and said, 559-4

29:2 Oh that 5414-4 I were as [in] months 3391 past, 6924 as [in] the days 3117 [when] God 433 preserved 8104-4 me;

29:3 When his candle 5216 shined 1984-2 upon my head, 7218 [and when] by his light 216 I walked 3212-4 [through] darkness; 2822

29:4 As I was in the days 3117 of my youth, 2779 when the secret 5475 of God 433 [was] upon my tabernacle; 168

29:5 When the Almighty 7706 [was] yet with me, [when] my children 5288 [were] about 5439 me;

29:6 When I washed 7364-2 my steps 1978 with butter, 2529 and the rock 6697 poured me out 6694-4 rivers 6388 of oil; 8081

29:7 When I went out 3318-2 to the gate 8179 through the city, 7176 [when] I prepared 3559-55 my seat 4186 in the street! 7339

29:8 The young men 5288 saw 7200-1 me, and hid 2244-8 themselves: and the aged 3453 arose, 6965-1 [and] stood up. 5975-1

29:9 The princes 8269 refrained 6113-1 talking, 4405 and laid 7760-4 [their] hand 3709 on their mouth. 6310

29:10 The nobles 5057 held 2244-8 their peace, 6963 and their tongue 3956 cleaved 1692-1 to the roof of their mouth. 2441

29:11 When the ear 241 heard 8085-1 [me], then it blessed 833-17 me; and when the eye 5869 saw 7200-1 [me], it gave witness 5749-55 to me:

29:12 Because I delivered 4422-17 the poor 6041 that cried, 7768-18 and the fatherless, 3490 and [him that had] none to help 5826-6 him.

29:13 The blessing 1293 of him that was ready to perish 6-6 came 935-4 upon me: and I caused the widow's 490 heart 3820 to sing for joy. 7442-55

29:14 I put on 3847-1 righteousness, 6664 and it clothed 3847-4 me: my judgment 4941 [was] as a robe 4598 and a diadem. 6797

29:15 I was eyes 5869 to the blind, 5787 and feet 7272 [was] I to the lame. 6455

29:16 I [was] a father 1 to the poor: 34 and the cause 7379 [which] I knew 3045-1 not I searched out. 2713-4

29:17 And I brake 7665-17 the jaws 4973 of the wicked, 5767 and plucked 7993-55 the spoil 2964 out of his teeth. 8127

29:18 Then I said, 559-4 I shall die 1478-4 in my nest, 7064 and I shall multiply 7235-55 [my] days 3117 as the sand. 2344

29:19 My root 8328 [was] spread out 6605-7 by the waters, 4325 and the dew 2919 lay all night 3885-4 upon my branch. 7105

29:20 My glory 3519 [was] fresh 2319 in me, 5978 and my bow 7198 was renewed 2498-55 in my hand. 3027

29:21 Unto me [men] gave ear, 8085-1 and waited, 3176-14 and kept silence 1826-4 at 3926 my counsel. 6098

29:22 After 310 my words 1697 they spake not again; 8138-4 and my speech 4405 dropped 5197-4 upon them.

29:23 And they waited 3176-14 for me as for the rain; 4306 and they opened 6473-1 their mouth 6310 wide [as] for the latter rain. 4456

29:24 [If] I laughed 7832-4 on them, they believed 539-55 [it] not; and the light 216 of my countenance 6440 they cast not down. 5307-55

29:25 I chose 977-4 out their way, 1870 and sat 3427-4 chief, 7218 and dwelt 7931-4 as a king 4428 in the army, 1416 as one [that] comforteth 5162-17 the mourners. 57

30:1 But now [they that are] younger 6810 3117 than I have me in derision, 7832-1 whose fathers 1 I would have disdained 3988-1 to have set 7896-2 with the dogs 3611 of my flock. 6629

30:2 Yea, whereto 4100 [might] the strength 3581 of their hands 3027 [profit] me, in whom old age 3624 was perished? 6-1

30:3 For want 2639 and famine 3720 [they were] solitary; 1565 fleeing 6207-6 into the wilderness 6723 in former time 570 desolate 7722 and waste. 4875

30:4 Who cut up 6998-5 mallows 4408 by the bushes, 7880 and juniper 7574 roots 8328 [for] their meat. 3899

30:5 They were driven forth 1644-29 from among 1460 [men], (they cried 7321-55 after them as [after] a thief;) 1590

30:6 To dwell 7931-2 in the clifts 6178 of the valleys, 5158 [in] caves 2356 of the earth, 6083 and [in] the rocks. 3710

30:7 Among the bushes 7880 they brayed; 5101-4 under the nettles 2738 they were gathered together. 5596-29

30:8 [They were] children 1121 of fools, 5036 yea, children 1121 of base men: 8034 they were viler 5217-8 than the earth. 776

30:9 And now am I their song, 5058 yea, I am their byword. 4405

30:10 They abhor 8581-14 me, they flee far 7368-1 from me, and spare 2820-1 not to spit 7536 in my face. 6440

30:11 Because he hath loosed 6605-14 my cord, 3499 and afflicted 6031-17 me, they have also let loose 7971-14 the bridle 7448 before 6440 me.

30:12 Upon [my] right 3225 [hand] rise 6965-4 the youth; 6526 they push away 7971-14 my feet, 7272 and they raise up 5549-4 against me the ways 734 of their destruction. 343

30:13 They mar 5420-1 my path, 5410 they set forward 3276-55 my calamity, 1942|1962-k they have no helper. 5826-6

30:14 They came 857-4 [upon me] as a wide 7342 breaking in 6556 [of waters]: in 8478 the desolation 7722 they rolled 1556-115 themselves [upon me].

30:15 Terrors 1091 are turned 2015-90 upon me: they pursue 7291-4 my soul 5082 as the wind: 7307 and my welfare 3444 passeth away 5674-1 as a cloud. 5645

30:16 And now my soul 5315 is poured out 8210-101 upon me; the days 3117 of affliction 6040 have taken hold upon me. 270-4

30:17 My bones 6106 are pierced 5365-14 in me in the night season: 3915 and my sinews 6207-6 take no rest. 7901-4

30:18 By the great 7230 force 3581 [of my disease] is my garment 3830 changed: 2664-101 it bindeth me about 247-4 as the collar 6310 of my coat. 3801

30:19 He hath cast 3384-52 me into the mire, 2563 and I am become like 4911-101 dust 6083 and ashes. 665

30:20 I cry 7768-17 unto thee, and thou dost not hear 6030-4 me: I stand up, 5975-1 and thou regardest 995-113 me [not].

30:21 Thou art become 2015-11 cruel 393 to me: with thy strong 6108 hand 3027 thou opposest 7852-4 thyself against me.

30:22 Thou liftest me up 5375-4 to the wind; 7307 thou causest me to ride 7392-55 [upon it], and dissolvest 4127-34 my substance. 8454|7738-17-k

30:23 For I know 3045-1 [that] thou wilt bring 7725-55 me [to] death, 4194 and [to] the house 1004 appointed 4150 for all living. 2416

30:24 Howbeit he will not stretch out 7971-4 [his] hand 3027 to the grave, 1164 though they cry 7769 in his destruction. 6365

30:25 Did not I weep 1058-1 for him that was in trouble? 7186 3117 was [not] my soul 5315 grieved 5701-1 for the poor? 34

30:26 When I looked 6960-14 for good, 2896 then evil 7451 came 935-4 [unto me]: and when I waited 3176-17 for light, 216 there came 935-4 darkness. 652

30:27 My bowels 4578 boiled, 7570-27 and rested 1826-1 not: the days 3117 of affliction 6040 prevented 6923-14 me.

30:28 I went 1980-14 mourning 6937-6 without the sun: 2535 I stood up, 6965-1 [and] I cried 7768-17 in the congregation. 6951

30:29 I am a brother 251 to dragons, 8577 and a companion 7453 to owls. 1323 3284

30:30 My skin 5785 is black 7835-1 upon me, and my bones 6106 are burned 2787-1 with heat. 2721

30:31 My harp 3658 also is [turned] to mourning, 60 and my organ 5748 into the voice 6963 of them that weep. 1058-6

31:1 I made 3772-1 a covenant 1285 with mine eyes; 5869 why then should I think 995-113 upon a maid? 1330

31:2 For what portion 2506 of God 433 [is there] from above? 4605 and [what] inheritance 5159 of the Almighty 7706 from on high? 4791

31:3 [Is] not destruction 343 to the wicked? 5767 and a strange 5235 [punishment] to the workers 6466-6 of iniquity? 205

31:4 Doth not he see 7200-4 my ways, 1870 and count 5608-4 all my steps? 6806

31:5 If I have walked 1980-1 with vanity, 7723 or if my foot 7272 hath hasted 2363-4 to deceit; 4820

31:6 Let me be weighed 8254-4 in an even 6664 balance, 3976 that God 433 may know 3045-4 mine integrity. 8538

31:7 If my step 838 hath turned 5186-4 out of the way, 1870 and mine heart 3820 walked 1980-1 after 310 mine eyes, 5869 and if any blot 3971 hath cleaved 1692-1 to mine hands; 3709

31:8 [Then] let me sow, 2232-4 and let another 312 eat; 398-4 yea, let my offspring 6631 be rooted out. 8327-29

31:9 If mine heart 3820 have been deceived 6601-8 by a woman, 802 or [if] I have laid wait 693-1 at my neighbour's 7453 door; 6607

31:10 [Then] let my wife 802 grind 2912-4 unto another, 312 and let others 312 bow down 3766-4 upon her.

31:11 For this [is] an heinous crime; 2154 yea, it [is] an iniquity 5771 [to be punished by] the judges. 6414

31:12 For it [is] a fire 784 [that] consumeth 398-4 to destruction, 11 and would root out 8327-17 all mine increase. 8393

31:13 If I did despise 3988-4 the cause 4941 of my manservant 5650 or of my maidservant, 519 when they contended 7379 with me;

31:14 What then shall I do 6213-4 when God 410 riseth up? 6965-4 and when he visiteth, 6485-4 what shall I answer 7725-55 him?

31:15 Did not he that made 6213-6 me in the womb 990 make 6213-1 him? and did not one 259 fashion 3559-34 us in the womb? 7358

31:16 If I have withheld 4513-4 the poor 1800 from [their] desire, 2656 or have caused the eyes 5869 of the widow 490 to fail; 3615-17

31:17 Or have eaten 398-4 my morsel 6595 myself alone, and the fatherless 3490 hath not eaten 398-1 thereof;

31:18 (For from my youth 5271 he was brought up 1431-1 with me, as [with] a father, 1 and I have guided 5148-55 her from my mother's 517 womb;) 990

31:19 If I have seen 7200-4 any perish 6-6 for want of clothing, 3830 or any poor 34 without covering; 3682

31:20 If his loins 2504 have not blessed 1288-14 me, and [if] he were [not] warmed 2552-101 with the fleece 1488 of my sheep; 3532

31:21 If I have lifted up 5130-52 my hand 3027 against the fatherless, 3490 when I saw 7200-4 my help 5833 in the gate: 8179

31:22 [Then] let mine arm 3802 fall 5307-4 from my shoulder blade, 7929 and mine arm 248 be broken 7665-11 from the bone. 7070

31:23 For destruction 343 [from] God 410 [was] a terror 6343 to me, and by reason of his highness 7613 I could 3201-4 not endure.

31:24 If I have made 7760-1 gold 2091 my hope, 3689 or have said 559-1 to the fine gold, 3800 [Thou art] my confidence; 4009

31:25 If I rejoiced 8055-4 because my wealth 2428 [was] great, 7227 and because mine hand 3027 had gotten 4672-1 much; 3524

31:26 If I beheld 7200-4 the sun 216 when it shined, 1984-55 or the moon 3394 walking 1980-6 [in] brightness; 3368

31:27 And my heart 3820 hath been secretly 5643 enticed, 6601-4 or my mouth 6310 hath kissed 5401-4 my hand: 3027

31:28 This also [were] an iniquity 5771 [to be punished by] the judge: 6416 for I should have denied 3584-14 the God 410 [that is] above. 4605

31:29 If I rejoiced 8055-4 at the destruction 6365 of him that hated 8130-18 me, or lifted up 5782-110 myself when evil 7451 found 4672-1 him:

31:30 Neither have I suffered 5414-1 my mouth 2441 to sin 2398-2 by wishing 7592-2 a curse 423 to his soul. 5315

31:31 If the men 4962 of my tabernacle 168 said 559-1 not, Oh that 5414-4 we had of his flesh! 1320 we cannot be satisfied. 7646-4

31:32 The stranger 1616 did not lodge 3885-4 in the street: 2351 [but] I opened 6605-4 my doors 1817 to the traveller. 734

31:33 If I covered 3680-14 my transgressions 6588 as Adam, 120 by hiding 2934-2 mine iniquity 5771 in my bosom: 2243

31:34 Did I fear 6206-4 a great 7227 multitude, 1995 or did the contempt 937 of families 4940 terrify 2865-55 me, that I kept silence, 1826-4 [and] went not out 3318-4 of the door? 6607

31:35 Oh that 5414-4 one would hear 8085-6 me! behold, my desire 8420 [is, that] the Almighty 7706 would answer 6030-4 me, and [that] mine adversary 376 7379 had written 3789-1 a book. 5612

31:36 Surely I would take 5375-4 it upon my shoulder, 7926 [and] bind 6029-4 it [as] a crown 5850 to me.

31:37 I would declare 5046-55 unto him the number 4557 of my steps; 6806 as a prince 5057 would I go near 7126-17 unto him.

31:38 If my land 127 cry 2199-4 against me, or that the furrows 8525 likewise 3162 thereof complain; 1058-4

31:39 If I have eaten 398-1 the fruits 3581 thereof without money, 3701 or have caused the owners 1167 thereof to lose 5301-52 their life: 5315

31:40 Let thistles 2336 grow 3318-4 instead of wheat, 2406 and cockle 890 instead of barley. 8184 The words 1697 of Job 347 are ended. 8552-1

32:1 So these three 7969 men 582 ceased 7673-4 to answer 6030-2 Job, 347 because he [was] righteous 6662 in his own eyes. 5869

32:2 Then was kindled 2734-4 the wrath 639 of Elihu 453 the son 1121 of Barachel 1292 the Buzite, 940 of the kindred 4940 of Ram: 7410 against Job 347 was his wrath 639 kindled, 2734-1 because he justified 6663-15 himself 5315 rather than God. 430

32:3 Also against his three 7969 friends 7453 was his wrath 639 kindled, 2734-1 because they had found 4672-1 no answer, 4617 and [yet] had condemned 7561-55 Job. 347

32:4 Now Elihu 453 had waited 2442-14 till Job 347 had spoken, 1697 because they [were] elder 2205 3117 than he.

32:5 When Elihu 453 saw 7200-4 that [there was] no answer 4617 in the mouth 6310 of [these] three 7969 men, 582 then his wrath 639 was kindled. 2734-4

32:6 And Elihu 453 the son 1121 of Barachel 1292 the Buzite 940 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 I [am] young, 6810 3117 and ye [are] very old; 3453 wherefore I was afraid, 2119-1 and durst 3372-4 not shew 2331-15 you mine opinion. 1843

32:7 I said, 559-1 Days 3117 should speak, 1696-17 and multitude 7230 of years 8141 should teach 3045-55 wisdom. 2451

32:8 But 403 [there is] a spirit 7307 in man: 582 and the inspiration 5397 of the Almighty 7706 giveth them understanding. 995-4

32:9 Great 7227 men are not [always] wise: 2449-4 neither do the aged 2205 understand 995-4 judgment. 4941

32:10 Therefore I said, 559-1 Hearken 8085-3 to me; I also will shew 2331-17 mine opinion. 1843

32:11 Behold, I waited 3176-52 for your words; 1697 I gave ear 238-55 to your reasons, 8394 whilst ye searched out 2713-4 what to say. 4405

32:12 Yea, I attended 995-113 unto you, and, behold, [there was] none of you that convinced 3198-56 Job, 347 [or] that answered 6030-6 his words: 561

32:13 Lest ye should say, 559-4 We have found 4672-1 out wisdom: 2451 God 410 thrusteth him down, 5086-4 not man. 376

32:14 Now he hath not directed 6186-1 [his] words 4405 against me: neither will I answer 7725-55 him with your speeches. 561

32:15 They were amazed, 2865-1 they answered 6030-1 no more: they left off 6275-52 speaking. 4405

32:16 When I had waited, 3176-52 (for they spake 1696-17 not, but stood still, 5975-1 [and] answered 6030-1 no more;)

32:17 [I said], I will answer 6030-4 also my part, 2506 I also will shew 2331-17 mine opinion. 1843

32:18 For I am full 4390-1 of matter, 4405 the spirit 7307 within 990 me constraineth 6693-52 me.

32:19 Behold, my belly 990 [is] as wine 3196 [which] hath no vent; 6605-11 it is ready to burst 1234-11 like new 2319 bottles. 178

32:20 I will speak, 1696-17 that I may be refreshed: 7304-4 I will open 6605-4 my lips 8193 and answer. 6030-4

32:21 Let me not, I pray you, accept 5375-4 any man's 376 person, 6440 neither let me give flattering titles 3655-17 unto man. 120

32:22 For I know 3045-1 not to give flattering titles; 3655-17 [in so doing] my maker 6213-6 would soon 4592 take me away. 5375-4

33:1 Wherefore, 199 Job, 347 I pray thee, hear 8085-3 my speeches, 4405 and hearken 238-54 to all my words. 1697

33:2 Behold, now I have opened 6605-1 my mouth, 6310 my tongue 3956 hath spoken 1696-14 in my mouth. 2441

33:3 My words 561 [shall be of] the uprightness 3476 of my heart: 3820 and my lips 8193 shall utter 4448-14 knowledge 1847 clearly. 1305-7

33:4 The Spirit 7307 of God 410 hath made 6213-1 me, and the breath 5397 of the Almighty 7706 hath given me life. 2421-17

33:5 If thou canst 3201-4 answer 7725-53 me, set [thy words] in order 6186-3 before 6440 me, stand up. 3320-100

33:6 Behold, I [am] according to thy wish 6310 in God's 410 stead: I also am formed 7169-27 out of the clay. 2563

33:7 Behold, my terror 367 shall not make thee afraid, 1204-17 neither shall my hand 405 be heavy 3513-4 upon thee.

33:8 Surely thou hast spoken 559-1 in mine hearing, 241 and I have heard 8085-4 the voice 6963 of [thy] words, 4405 [saying],

33:9 I am clean 2134 without transgression, 6588 I [am] innocent; 2643 neither [is there] iniquity 5771 in me.

33:10 Behold, he findeth 4672-4 occasions 8569 against me, he counteth 2803-4 me for his enemy, 341-6

33:11 He putteth 7760-4 my feet 7272 in the stocks, 5465 he marketh 8104-4 all my paths. 734

33:12 Behold, [in] this thou art not just: 6663-1 I will answer 6030-4 thee, that God 433 is greater 7235-4 than man. 582

33:13 Why dost thou strive 7378-1 against him? for he giveth not account 6030-4 of any of his matters. 1697

33:14 For God 410 speaketh 1696-17 once, 259 yea twice, 8147 [yet man] perceiveth 7789-4 it not.

33:15 In a dream, 2472 in a vision 2384 of the night, 3915 when deep sleep 8639 falleth 5307-2 upon men, 582 in slumberings 8572 upon the bed; 4904

33:16 Then he openeth 1540-4 the ears 241 of men, 582 and sealeth 2856-4 their instruction, 4561

33:17 That he may withdraw 5493-53 man 120 [from his] purpose, 4639 and hide 3680-17 pride 1466 from man. 1397

33:18 He keepeth back 2820-4 his soul 5315 from the pit, 7845 and his life 2416 from perishing 5674-2 by the sword. 7973

33:19 He is chastened 3198-90 also with pain 4341 upon his bed, 4904 and the multitude 7230|7379-k of his bones 6106 with strong 386 [pain]:

33:20 So that his life 2416 abhorreth 2092-14 bread, 3899 and his soul 5315 dainty 8378 meat. 3978

33:21 His flesh 1320 is consumed away, 3615-4 that it cannot be seen; 7210 and his bones 6106 [that] were not seen 7200-27 stick out. 8192-27|8205-k

33:22 Yea, his soul 5315 draweth near 7126-4 unto the grave, 7845 and his life 2416 to the destroyers. 4191-56

33:23 If there be 3426 a messenger 4397 with him, an interpreter, 3887-56 one 259 among a thousand, 505 to shew 5046-53 unto man 120 his uprightness: 3476

33:24 Then he is gracious 2603-4 unto him, and saith, 559-4 Deliver 6308-3 him from going down 3381-2 to the pit: 7845 I have found 4672-1 a ransom. 3724

33:25 His flesh 1320 shall be fresher 7375-1 than a child's: 5290 he shall return 7725-4 to the days 3117 of his youth: 5934

33:26 He shall pray 6279-4 unto God, 433 and he will be favourable 7521-4 unto him: and he shall see 7200-4 his face 6440 with joy: 8643 for he will render 7725-55 unto man 582 his righteousness. 6666

33:27 He looketh 7789-4 upon men, 582 and [if any] say, 559-4 I have sinned, 2398-1 and perverted 5753-52 [that which was] right, 3477 and it profited 7737-1 me not;

33:28 He will deliver 6299-1 his soul 5315 from going 5674-2 into the pit, 7845 and his life 2416 shall see 7200-4 the light. 216

33:29 Lo, all these [things] worketh 6466-4 God 410 oftentimes 6471 7969 with man, 1397

33:30 To bring back 7725-53 his soul 5315 from the pit, 7845 to be enlightened 215-9 with the light 216 of the living. 2416

33:31 Mark well, 7181-54 O Job, 347 hearken 8085-3 unto me: hold thy peace, 2790-54 and I will speak. 1696-17

33:32 If thou hast 3426 any thing to say, 4405 answer 7725-54 me: speak, 1696-16 for I desire 2654-1 to justify 6663-15 thee.

33:33 If not, hearken 8085-3 unto me: hold thy peace, 2790-54 and I shall teach 502-17 thee wisdom. 2451

34:1 Furthermore Elihu 453 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4

34:2 Hear 8085-3 my words, 4405 O ye wise 2450 [men]; and give ear 238-54 unto me, ye that have knowledge. 3045-6

34:3 For the ear 241 trieth 974-4 words, 4405 as the mouth 2441 tasteth 2938-4 meat. 398-2

34:4 Let us choose 977-4 to us judgment: 4941 let us know 3045-4 among ourselves what [is] good. 2896

34:5 For Job 347 hath said, 559-1 I am righteous: 6663-1 and God 410 hath taken away 5493-52 my judgment. 4941

34:6 Should I lie 3576-17 against my right? 4941 my wound 2671 [is] incurable 605-7 without transgression. 6588

34:7 What man 1397 [is] like Job, 347 [who] drinketh 8354-4 up scorning 3933 like water? 4325

34:8 Which goeth 732-1 in company 2274 with the workers 6466-6 of iniquity, 205 and walketh 3212-2 with wicked 7562 men. 582

34:9 For he hath said, 559-1 It profiteth 5532-4 a man 1397 nothing that he should delight 7521-2 himself with God. 430

34:10 Therefore hearken 8085-3 unto me, ye men 582 of understanding: 3824 far be it 2486 from God, 410 [that he should do] wickedness; 7562 and [from] the Almighty, 7706 [that he should commit] iniquity. 5766

34:11 For the work 6467 of a man 120 shall he render 7999-17 unto him, and cause every man 376 to find 4672-55 according to [his] ways. 734

34:12 Yea, surely 551 God 410 will not do wickedly, 7561-55 neither will the Almighty 7706 pervert 5791-17 judgment. 4941

34:13 Who hath given him a charge 6485-1 over the earth? 776 or who hath disposed 7760-1 the whole world? 8398

34:14 If he set 7760-4 his heart 3820 upon man, [if] he gather 622-4 unto himself his spirit 7307 and his breath; 5397

34:15 All flesh 1320 shall perish 1478-4 together, 3162 and man 120 shall turn again 7725-4 unto dust. 6083

34:16 If now [thou hast] understanding, 998 hear 8085-3 this: hearken 238-54 to the voice 6963 of my words. 4405

34:17 Shall even he that hateth 8130-6 right 4941 govern? 2280-4 and wilt thou condemn 7561-55 him that is most 3524 just? 6662

34:18 [Is it fit] to say 559-2 to a king, 4428 [Thou art] wicked? 1100 [and] to princes, 5081 [Ye are] ungodly? 7563

34:19 [How much less to him] that accepteth 5375-1 not the persons 6440 of princes, 8269 nor regardeth 5234-14 the rich 7771 more than 6440 the poor? 1800 for they all [are] the work 4639 of his hands. 3027

34:20 In a moment 7281 shall they die, 4191-4 and the people 5971 shall be troubled 1607-29 at midnight, 2676 3915 and pass away: 5674-4 and the mighty 47 shall be taken away 5493-55 without hand. 3027

34:21 For his eyes 5869 [are] upon the ways 1870 of man, 376 and he seeth 7200-4 all his goings. 6806

34:22 [There is] no darkness, 2822 nor shadow of death, 6757 where the workers 6466-6 of iniquity 205 may hide 5641-9 themselves.

34:23 For he will not lay 7760-4 upon man 376 more [than right]; that he should enter 1980-2 into judgment 4941 with God. 410

34:24 He shall break in pieces 7489-4 mighty 3524 men without number, 2714 and set 5975-55 others 312 in their stead.

34:25 Therefore he knoweth 5234-55 their works, 4566 and he overturneth 2015-1 [them] in the night, 3915 so that they are destroyed. 1792-101

34:26 He striketh 5606-1 them as 8478 wicked 7563 men in the open 4725 sight 7200-6 of others;

34:27 Because they turned back 5493-1 from 310 him, and would not consider 7919-52 any of his ways: 1870

34:28 So that they cause the cry 6818 of the poor 1800 to come 935-53 unto him, and he heareth 8085-4 the cry 6818 of the afflicted. 6041

34:29 When he giveth quietness, 8252-55 who then can make trouble? 7561-55 and when he hideth 5641-55 [his] face, 6440 who then can behold 7789-4 him? whether [it be done] against a nation, 1471 or against a man 120 only: 3162

34:30 That the hypocrite 120 2611 reign 4427-2 not, lest the people 5971 be ensnared. 4170

34:31 Surely it is meet to be said 559-9 unto God, 410 I have borne 5375-1 [chastisement], I will not offend 2254-4 [any more]:

34:32 [That which] I see 2372-4 not 1107 teach 3384-54 thou me: if I have done 6466-1 iniquity, 5766 I will do 3254-55 no more.

34:33 [Should it be] according to thy mind? he will recompense 7999-17 it, whether 3588 thou refuse, 3988-1 or whether 3588 thou choose; 977-4 and not I: therefore speak 1696-16 what thou knowest. 3045-1

34:34 Let men 582 of understanding 3824 tell 559-4 me, and let a wise 2450 man 1397 hearken 8085-6 unto me.

34:35 Job 347 hath spoken 1696-17 without knowledge, 1847 and his words 1697 [were] without wisdom. 7919-53

34:36 My desire 15|1 [is that] Job 347 may be tried 974-11 unto the end 5331 because of [his] answers 8666 for wicked 205 men. 582

34:37 For he addeth 3254-55 rebellion 6588 unto his sin, 2403 he clappeth 5606-4 [his hands] among us, and multiplieth 7235-55 his words 561 against God. 410

35:1 Elihu 453 spake 6030-4 moreover, and said, 559-4

35:2 Thinkest 2803-1 thou this to be right, 4941 [that] thou saidst, 559-1 My righteousness 6664 [is] more than God's? 410

35:3 For thou saidst, 559-4 What advantage 5532-4 will it be unto thee? [and], What profit 3276-55 shall I have, [if I be cleansed] from my sin? 2403

35:4 I will answer 7725-55 4405 thee, and thy companions 7453 with thee.

35:5 Look 5027-54 unto the heavens, 8064 and see; 7200-3 and behold 7789-3 the clouds 7834 [which] are higher 1361-1 than thou.

35:6 If thou sinnest, 2398-1 what doest 6466-4 thou against him? or [if] thy transgressions 6588 be multiplied, 7231-1 what doest 6213-4 thou unto him?

35:7 If thou be righteous, 6663-1 what givest 5414-4 thou him? or what receiveth 3947-4 he of thine hand? 3027

35:8 Thy wickedness 7562 [may hurt] a man 376 as thou [art]; and thy righteousness 6666 [may profit] the son 1121 of man. 120

35:9 By reason of the multitude 7230 of oppressions 6217 they make [the oppressed] to cry: 2199-55 they cry out 7768-17 by reason of the arm 2220 of the mighty. 7227

35:10 But none saith, 559-1 Where [is] God 433 my maker, 6213-6 who giveth 5414-6 songs 2158 in the night; 3915

35:11 Who teacheth 502-18 us more than the beasts 929 of the earth, 776 and maketh us wiser 2449-17 than the fowls 5775 of heaven? 8064

35:12 There they cry, 6817-4 but none giveth answer, 6030-4 because 6440 of the pride 1347 of evil 7451 men.

35:13 Surely God 410 will not hear 8085-4 vanity, 7723 neither will the Almighty 7706 regard 7789-4 it.

35:14 Although 637 thou sayest 559-4 thou shalt not see 7789-4 him, [yet] judgment 1779 [is] before 6440 him; therefore trust 2342-34 thou in him.

35:15 But now, because [it is] not [so], he hath visited 6485-1 in his anger; 639 yet he knoweth 3045-1 [it] not in great 3966 extremity: 6580

35:16 Therefore doth Job 347 open 6475-4 his mouth 6310 in vain; 1892 he multiplieth 3527-55 words 4405 without 1097 knowledge. 1847

36:1 Elihu 453 also proceeded, 3254-55 and said, 559-4

36:2 Suffer 3803-16 me a little, 2191 and I will shew 2331-17 thee that [I have] yet to speak 4405 on God's 433 behalf.

36:3 I will fetch 5375-4 my knowledge 1843 from afar, 7350 and will ascribe 5414-4 righteousness 6664 to my Maker. 6466-6

36:4 For truly 551 my words 4405 [shall] not [be] false: 8267 he that is perfect 8549 in knowledge 1844 [is] with thee.

36:5 Behold, God 410 [is] mighty, 3524 and despiseth 3988-4 not [any: he is] mighty 3524 in strength 3581 [and] wisdom. 3820

36:6 He preserveth not the life 2421-17 of the wicked: 7563 but giveth 5414-4 right 4941 to the poor. 6041

36:7 He withdraweth 1639-4 not his eyes 5869 from the righteous: 6662 but with kings 4428 [are they] on the throne; 3678 yea, he doth establish 3427-55 them for ever, 5331 and they are exalted. 1361-4

36:8 And if [they be] bound 631-7 in fetters, 2131 [and] be holden 3920-11 in cords 2256 of affliction; 6040

36:9 Then he sheweth 5046-55 them their work, 6467 and their transgressions 6588 that they have exceeded. 1396-101

36:10 He openeth 1540-4 also their ear 241 to discipline, 4148 and commandeth 559-4 that they return 7725-4 from iniquity. 205

36:11 If they obey 8085-4 and serve 5647-4 [him], they shall spend 3615-17 their days 3117 in prosperity, 2896 and their years 8141 in pleasures. 5273

36:12 But if they obey 8085-4 not, they shall perish 5674-4 by the sword, 7973 and they shall die 1478-4 without knowledge. 1847

36:13 But the hypocrites 2611 in heart 3820 heap up 7760-4 wrath: 639 they cry 7768-17 not when he bindeth 631-1 them.

36:14 They 5315 die 4191-4 in youth, 5290 and their life 2416 [is] among the unclean. 6945

36:15 He delivereth 2502-17 the poor 6041 in his affliction, 6040 and openeth 1540-4 their ears 241 in oppression. 3906

36:16 Even so would he have removed 5496-52 thee out 6310 of the strait 6862 [into] a broad place, 7338 where 8478 [there is] no straitness; 4164 and that which should be set on 5183 thy table 7979 [should be] full 4390-1 of fatness. 1880

36:17 But thou hast fulfilled 4390-1 the judgment 1779 of the wicked: 7563 judgment 1779 and justice 4941 take hold 8551-4 [on thee].

36:18 Because [there is] wrath, 2534 [beware] lest he take thee away 5496-55 with [his] stroke: 5607 then a great 7230 ransom 3724 cannot deliver 5186-55 thee.

36:19 Will he esteem 6186-4 thy riches? 7769 [no], not gold, 1222 nor all the forces 3981 of strength. 3581

36:20 Desire 7602-4 not the night, 3915 when people 5971 are cut off 5927-2 in their place.

36:21 Take heed, 8104-10 regard 6437-4 not iniquity: 205 for this hast thou chosen 977-1 rather than affliction. 6040

36:22 Behold, God 410 exalteth 7682-55 by his power: 3581 who teacheth 3384-56 like him?

36:23 Who hath enjoined 6485-1 him his way? 1870 or who can say, 559-1 Thou hast wrought 6466-1 iniquity? 5766

36:24 Remember 2142-3 that thou magnify 7679-55 his work, 6467 which men 582 behold. 7891-31

36:25 Every man 120 may see 2372-1 it; man 582 may behold 5027-55 [it] afar off. 7350

36:26 Behold, God 410 [is] great, 7689 and we know 3045-4 [him] not, neither can the number 4557 of his years 8141 be searched out. 2714

36:27 For he maketh small 1639-17 the drops 5198 of water: 4325 they pour down 2212-4 rain 4306 according to the vapour 108 thereof:

36:28 Which the clouds 7834 do drop 5140-4 [and] distil 7491-4 upon man 120 abundantly. 7227

36:29 Also can [any] understand 995-4 the spreadings 4666 of the clouds, 5645 [or] the noise 8663 of his tabernacle? 5521

36:30 Behold, he spreadeth 6566-1 his light 216 upon it, and covereth 3680-14 the bottom 8328 of the sea. 3220

36:31 For by them judgeth 1777-4 he the people; 5971 he giveth 5414-4 meat 400 in abundance. 4342-56

36:32 With clouds 3709 he covereth 3680-14 the light; 216 and commandeth 6680-17 it [not to shine] by [the cloud] that cometh betwixt. 6293-56

36:33 The noise 7452 thereof sheweth 5046-55 concerning it, the cattle 4735 also concerning the vapour. 5927-6

37:1 At this 2063 also my heart 3820 trembleth, 2729-4 and is moved 5425-4 out of his place. 4725

37:2 Hear 8085-3 attentively 8085-2 the noise 7267 of his voice, 6963 and the sound 1899 [that] goeth out 3318-4 of his mouth. 6310

37:3 He directeth 3474-14|8281-4 it under the whole heaven, 8064 and his lightning 216 unto the ends 3671 of the earth. 776

37:4 After 310 it a voice 6963 roareth: 7580-4 he thundereth 7481-55 with the voice 6963 of his excellency; 1347 and he will not stay 6117-17 them when his voice 6963 is heard. 8085-11

37:5 God 410 thundereth 7481-55 marvellously 6381-12 with his voice; 6963 great 1419 things doeth 6213-6 he, which we cannot comprehend. 3045-4

37:6 For he saith 559-4 to the snow, 7950 Be 1933-3 thou [on] the earth; 776 likewise to the small 4306 rain, 1653 and to the great 4306 rain 1653 of his strength. 5797

37:7 He sealeth up 2856-4 the hand 3027 of every man; 120 that all men 582 may know 3045-2 his work. 4639

37:8 Then the beasts 2416 go 935-4 into 1119 dens, 695 and remain 7931-4 in their places. 4585

37:9 Out of the south 2315 cometh 935-4 the whirlwind: 5492 and cold 7135 out of the north. 4215

37:10 By the breath 5397 of God 410 frost 7140 is given: 5414-4 and the breadth 7341 of the waters 4325 is straitened. 4164

37:11 Also by watering 7377 he wearieth 2959-55 the thick cloud: 5645 he scattereth 6327-55 his bright 216 cloud: 6051

37:12 And it is turned 2015-102 round about 4524 by his counsels: 8458 that they may do 6467 whatsoever he commandeth 6680-17 them upon the face 6440 of the world 8398 in the earth. 776

37:13 He causeth it to come, 4672-55 whether for correction, 7626 or for his land, 776 or for mercy. 2617

37:14 Hearken 238-54 unto this, O Job: 347 stand still, 5975-3 and consider 995-112 the wondrous works 6381-12 of God. 410

37:15 Dost thou know 3045-4 when God 433 disposed 7760-2 them, and caused the light 216 of his cloud 6051 to shine? 3313-52

37:16 Dost thou know 3045-4 the balancings 4657 of the clouds, 5645 the wondrous works 4652 of him which is perfect 8549 in knowledge? 1843

37:17 How thy garments 899 [are] warm, 2525 when he quieteth 8252-53 the earth 776 by the south 1864 [wind]?

37:18 Hast thou with him spread out 7554-55 the sky, 7834 [which is] strong, 2389 [and] as a molten 3332-94 looking glass? 7209

37:19 Teach 3045-54 us what we shall say 559-4 unto him; [for] we cannot order 6186-4 [our speech] by reason 6440 of darkness. 2822

37:20 Shall it be told 5608-29 him that I speak? 1696-17 if a man 376 speak, 559-1 surely he shall be swallowed up. 1104-29

37:21 And now [men] see 7200-1 not the bright 925 light 216 which [is] in the clouds: 7834 but the wind 7307 passeth, 5674-1 and cleanseth 2891-17 them.

37:22 Fair weather 2091 cometh 857-4 out of the north: 6828 with God 433 [is] terrible 3372-12 majesty. 1935

37:23 [Touching] the Almighty, 7706 we cannot find him out: 4672-1 [he is] excellent 7689 in power, 3581 and in judgment, 4941 and in plenty 7230 of justice: 6666 he will not afflict. 6031-17

37:24 Men 582 do therefore fear 3372-1 him: he respecteth 7200-4 not any [that are] wise 2450 of heart. 3820

38:1 Then the LORD 3068 answered 6030-4 Job 347 out of the whirlwind, 5591 and said, 559-4

38:2 Who [is] this that darkeneth 2821-56 counsel 6098 by words 4405 without knowledge? 1847

38:3 Gird up 247-3 now thy loins 2504 like a man; 1397 for I will demand 7592-4 of thee, and answer 3045-54 thou me.

38:4 Where 375 wast thou when I laid the foundations 3245-2 of the earth? 776 declare, 5046-54 if thou hast 3045-1 understanding. 998

38:5 Who hath laid 7760-1 the measures 4461 thereof, if thou knowest? 3045-4 or who hath stretched 5186-1 the line 6957 upon it?

38:6 Whereupon are the foundations 134 thereof fastened? 2883-90 or who laid 3384-1 the corner 6438 stone 68 thereof;

38:7 When the morning 1242 stars 3556 sang 7442-2 together, 3162 and all the sons 1121 of God 430 shouted 7321-55 for joy?

38:8 Or [who] shut up 5526-55 the sea 3220 with doors, 1817 when it brake forth, 1518-2 [as if] it had issued out 3318-4 of the womb? 7358

38:9 When I made 7760-2 the cloud 6051 the garment 3830 thereof, and thick darkness 6205 a swaddlingband 2854 for it,

38:10 And brake up 7665-4 for it my decreed 2706 [place], and set 7760-4 bars 1280 and doors, 1817

38:11 And said, 559-4 Hitherto 5704 6311 shalt thou come, 935-4 but no further: 3254-55 and here shall thy proud 1347 waves 1530 be stayed? 7896-4

38:12 Hast thou commanded 6680-14 the morning 1242 since thy days; 3117 [and] caused the dayspring 7837 to know 3045-14 his place; 4725

38:13 That it might take hold 270-2 of the ends 3671 of the earth, 776 that the wicked 7563 might be shaken 5287-11 out of it?

38:14 It is turned 2015-101 as clay 2563 [to] the seal; 2368 and they stand 3320-101 as a garment. 3830

38:15 And from the wicked 7563 their light 216 is withholden, 4513-11 and the high 7311-6 arm 2220 shall be broken. 7665-11

38:16 Hast thou entered 935-1 into the springs 5033 of the sea? 3220 or hast thou walked 1980-98 in the search 2714 of the depth? 8415

38:17 Have the gates 8179 of death 4194 been opened 1540-8 unto thee? or hast thou seen 7200-4 the doors 8179 of the shadow of death? 6757

38:18 Hast thou perceived 995-110 the breadth 7338 of the earth? 776 declare 5046-54 if thou knowest 3045-1 it all.

38:19 Where [is] the way 1870 [where] light 216 dwelleth? 7931-4 and [as for] darkness, 2822 where [is] the place 4725 thereof,

38:20 That thou shouldest take 3947-4 it to the bound 1366 thereof, and that thou shouldest know 995-4 the paths 5410 [to] the house 1004 thereof?

38:21 Knowest 3045-1 thou [it], because thou wast then born? 3205-11 or [because] the number 4557 of thy days 3117 [is] great? 7227

38:22 Hast thou entered 935-1 into the treasures 214 of the snow? 7950 or hast thou seen 7200-4 the treasures 214 of the hail, 1259

38:23 Which I have reserved 2820-1 against the time 6256 of trouble, 6862 against the day 3117 of battle 7128 and war? 4421

38:24 By what 335 way 1870 is the light 216 parted, 2505-11 [which] scattereth 6327-55 the east wind 6921 upon the earth? 776

38:25 Who hath divided 6385-14 a watercourse 8585 for the overflowing of waters, 7858 or a way 1870 for the lightning 2385 of thunder; 6963

38:26 To cause it to rain 4305-53 on the earth, 776 [where] no man 376 [is; on] the wilderness, 4057 wherein [there is] no man; 120

38:27 To satisfy 7646-53 the desolate 7722 and waste 4875 [ground]; and to cause the bud 4161 of the tender herb 1877 to spring forth? 6779-53

38:28 Hath 3426 the rain 4306 a father? 1 or who hath begotten 3205-52 the drops 96 of dew? 2919

38:29 Out of whose womb 990 came 3318-1 the ice? 7140 and the hoary frost 3713 of heaven, 8064 who hath gendered 3205-1 it?

38:30 The waters 4325 are hid 2244-101 as [with] a stone, 68 and the face 6440 of the deep 8415 is frozen. 3920-101

38:31 Canst thou bind 7194-17 the sweet influences 4575 of Pleiades, 3598 or loose 6605-17 the bands 4189 of Orion? 3685

38:32 Canst thou bring forth 3318-55 Mazzaroth 4216 in his season? 6256 or canst thou guide 5148-55 Arcturus 5906 with his sons? 1121

38:33 Knowest 3045-1 thou the ordinances 2708 of heaven? 8064 canst thou set 7760-4 the dominion 4896 thereof in the earth? 776

38:34 Canst thou lift up 7311-55 thy voice 6963 to the clouds, 5645 that abundance 8229 of waters 4325 may cover 3680-17 thee?

38:35 Canst thou send 7971-17 lightnings, 1300 that they may go, 3212-4 and say 559-4 unto thee, Here we [are]?

38:36 Who hath put 7896-1 wisdom 2451 in the inward parts? 2910 or who hath given 5414-1 understanding 998 to the heart? 7907

38:37 Who can number 5608-17 the clouds 7834 in wisdom? 2451 or who can stay 7901-55 the bottles 5035 of heaven, 8064

38:38 When the dust 6083 groweth 3332-2 into hardness, 4165 and the clods 7263 cleave fast together? 1692-29

38:39 Wilt thou hunt 6679-4 the prey 2964 for the lion? 3833 or fill 4390-17 the appetite 2416 of the young lions, 3715

38:40 When they couch 7817-4 in [their] dens, 4585 [and] abide 3427-4 in the covert 5521 to 3926 lie in wait? 695

38:41 Who provideth 3559-55 for the raven 6158 his food? 6718 when his young ones 3206 cry 7768-17 unto God, 410 they wander 8582-4 for lack 1097 of meat. 400

39:1 Knowest 3045-1 thou the time 6256 when the wild goats 3277 of the rock 5553 bring forth? 3205-2 [or] canst thou mark 8104-4 when the hinds 355 do calve? 2342-31

39:2 Canst thou number 5608-4 the months 3391 [that] they fulfil? 4390-17 or knowest 3045-1 thou the time 6256 when they bring forth? 3205-2

39:3 They bow 3766-4 themselves, they bring forth 6398-17 their young ones, 3206 they cast out 7971-17 their sorrows. 2256

39:4 Their young ones 1121 are in good liking, 2492-4 they grow up 7235-4 with corn; 1250 they go forth, 3318-1 and return 7725-1 not unto them.

39:5 Who hath sent out 7971-14 the wild ass 6501 free? 2670 or who hath loosed 6605-14 the bands 4147 of the wild ass? 6171

39:6 Whose house 1004 I have made 7760-1 the wilderness, 6160 and the barren 4420 land his dwellings. 4908

39:7 He scorneth 7832-4 the multitude 1995 of the city, 7151 neither regardeth 8085-4 he the crying 8663 of the driver. 5065-6

39:8 The range 3491 of the mountains 2022 [is] his pasture, 4829 and he searcheth 1875-4 after 310 every green thing. 3387

39:9 Will the unicorn 7214 be willing 14-4 to serve 5647-2 thee, or abide 3885-4 by thy crib? 18

39:10 Canst thou bind 7194-4 the unicorn 7214 with his band 5688 in the furrow? 8525 or will he harrow 7702-17 the valleys 6010 after 310 thee?

39:11 Wilt thou trust 982-4 him, because his strength 3581 [is] great? 7227 or wilt thou leave 5800-4 thy labour 3018 to him?

39:12 Wilt thou believe 539-55 him, that he will bring 7725-55|7725-4-k home thy seed, 2233 and gather 622-4 [it into] thy barn? 1637

39:13 [Gavest thou] the goodly 7443 wings 3671 unto the peacocks? 5965-8 or wings 84 and feathers 2624 unto the ostrich? 5133

39:14 Which leaveth 5800-4 her eggs 1000 in the earth, 776 and warmeth 2552-17 them in dust, 6083

39:15 And forgetteth 7911-4 that the foot 7272 may crush 2115-4 them, or that the wild 7704 beast 2416 may break 1758-4 them.

39:16 She is hardened 7188-52 against her young ones, 1121 as though [they were] not 3808 hers: her labour 3018 is in vain 7385 without fear; 6343

39:17 Because God 433 hath deprived 5382-52 her of wisdom, 2451 neither hath he imparted 2505-1 to her understanding. 998

39:18 What time 6256 she lifteth up 4754-55 herself on high, 4791 she scorneth 7832-4 the horse 5483 and his rider. 7392-6

39:19 Hast thou given 5414-4 the horse 5483 strength? 1369 hast thou clothed 3847-55 his neck 6677 with thunder? 7483

39:20 Canst thou make him afraid 7493-55 as a grasshopper? 697 the glory 1935 of his nostrils 5170 [is] terrible. 367

39:21 He paweth 2658-4 in the valley, 6010 and rejoiceth 7797-4 in [his] strength: 3581 he goeth on 3318-4 to meet 7125-2 the armed men. 5402

39:22 He mocketh 7832-4 at fear, 6343 and is not affrighted; 2865-11 neither turneth he back 7725-4 from 6440 the sword. 2719

39:23 The quiver 827 rattleth 7439-4 against him, the glittering 3851 spear 2595 and the shield. 3591

39:24 He swalloweth 1572-17 the ground 776 with fierceness 7494 and rage: 7267 neither believeth 539-55 he that [it is] the sound 6963 of the trumpet. 7782

39:25 He saith 559-4 among 1767 the trumpets, 7782 Ha, 1889 ha; 1889 and he smelleth 7306-55 the battle 4421 afar off, 7350 the thunder 7482 of the captains, 8269 and the shouting. 8643

39:26 Doth the hawk 5322 fly 82-55 by thy wisdom, 998 [and] stretch 6566-4 her wings 3671 toward the south? 8486

39:27 Doth the eagle 5404 mount up 1361-55 at thy command, 6310 and make her nest 7064 on high? 7311-55

39:28 She dwelleth 7931-4 and abideth 3885-118 on the rock, 5553 upon the crag 8127 of the rock, 5553 and the strong place. 4686

39:29 From thence she seeketh 2658-1 the prey, 400 [and] her eyes 5869 behold 5027-55 afar off. 7350

39:30 Her young 667 ones also suck up 5966-17 blood: 1818 and where the slain 2491 [are], there [is] she. 1931

40:1 Moreover the LORD 3068 answered 6030-4 Job, 347 and said, 559-4

40:2 Shall he that contendeth 7378-2 with the Almighty 7706 instruct 3250 [him]? he that reproveth 3198-56 God, 433 let him answer 6030-4 it.

40:3 Then Job 347 answered 6030-4 the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4

40:4 Behold, I am vile; 7043-1 what shall I answer 7725-55 thee? I will lay 7760-1 mine hand 3027 upon 3926 my mouth. 6310

40:5 Once 259 have I spoken; 1696-14 but I will not answer: 6030-4 yea, twice; 8147 but I will proceed no further. 3254-55

40:6 Then answered 6030-4 the LORD 3068 unto Job 347 out of the whirlwind, 5591 and said, 559-4

40:7 Gird up 247-3 thy loins 2504 now like a man: 1397 I will demand 7592-4 of thee, and declare 3045-54 thou unto me.

40:8 Wilt thou also disannul 6565-55 my judgment? 4941 wilt thou condemn 7561-55 me, that thou mayest be righteous? 6663-4

40:9 Hast thou an arm 2220 like God? 410 or canst thou thunder 7481-55 with a voice 6963 like him?

40:10 Deck 5710-3 thyself now [with] majesty 1347 and excellency; 1363 and array 3847-4 thyself with glory 1935 and beauty. 1926

40:11 Cast abroad 6327-54 the rage 5678 of thy wrath: 639 and behold 7200-3 every one [that is] proud, 1343 and abase 8213-54 him.

40:12 Look 7200-3 on every one [that is] proud, 1343 [and] bring him low; 3665-54 and tread down 1915-3 the wicked 7563 in their place.

40:13 Hide 2934-3 them in the dust 6083 together; 3162 [and] bind 2280-3 their faces 6440 in secret. 2934-7

40:14 Then will I also confess 3034-55 unto thee that thine own right hand 3225 can save 3467-55 thee.

40:15 Behold now behemoth, 930 which I made 6213-1 with thee; he eateth 398-4 grass 2682 as an ox. 1241

40:16 Lo now, his strength 3581 [is] in his loins, 4975 and his force 202 [is] in the navel 8306 of his belly. 990

40:17 He moveth 2654-4 his tail 2180 like a cedar: 730 the sinews 1517 of his stones 6344 are wrapped together. 8276-29

40:18 His bones 6106 [are as] strong 650 pieces of brass; 5154 his bones 1634 [are] like bars 4300 of iron. 1270

40:19 He [is] the chief 7225 of the ways 1870 of God: 410 he that made 6213-6 him can make his sword 2719 to approach 5066-55 [unto him].

40:20 Surely the mountains 2022 bring him forth 5375-4 food, 944 where all the beasts 2416 of the field 7704 play. 7832-17

40:21 He lieth 7901-4 under the shady trees, 6628 in the covert 5643 of the reed, 7070 and fens. 1207

40:22 The shady trees 6628 cover 5526-4 him [with] their shadow; 6752 the willows 6155 of the brook 5158 compass him about. 5437-4

40:23 Behold, he drinketh up 6231-4 a river, 5104 [and] hasteth 2648-4 not: he trusteth 982-4 that he can draw up 1518-4 Jordan 3383 into his mouth. 6310

40:24 He taketh 3947-4 it with his eyes: 5869 [his] nose 639 pierceth 5344-4 through snares. 4170

41:1 Canst thou draw out 4900-4 leviathan 3882 with an hook? 2443 or his tongue 3956 with a cord 2256 [which] thou lettest down? 8257-55

41:2 Canst thou put 7760-4 an hook 100 into his nose? 639 or bore 5344-4 his jaw 3895 through with a thorn? 2336

41:3 Will he make many 7235-55 supplications 8469 unto thee? will he speak 1696-17 soft 7390 [words] unto thee?

41:4 Will he make 3772-4 a covenant 1285 with thee? wilt thou take 3947-4 him for a servant 5650 for ever? 5769

41:5 Wilt thou play 7832-17 with him as [with] a bird? 6833 or wilt thou bind 7194-4 him for thy maidens? 5291

41:6 Shall the companions 2271 make a banquet 3739-4 of him? shall they part 2673-4 him among the merchants? 3669

41:7 Canst thou fill 4390-17 his skin 5785 with barbed irons? 7905 or his head 7218 with fish 1709 spears? 6767

41:8 Lay 7760-3 thine hand 3709 upon him, remember 2142-3 the battle, 4421 do no more. 3254-55

41:9 Behold, the hope 8431 of him is in vain: 3576-8 shall not [one] be cast down 2904-93 even at the sight 4758 of him?

41:10 None [is so] fierce 393 that dare stir him up: 5782-4|5782-55-k who then is able to stand 3320-101 before 6440 me?

41:11 Who hath prevented 6923-52 me, that I should repay 7999-17 [him? whatsoever is] under the whole heaven 8064 is mine.

41:12 I will not conceal 2790-55 his parts, 907 nor his power, 1369 1697 nor his comely 2433 proportion. 6187

41:13 Who can discover 1540-14 the face 6440 of his garment? 3830 [or] who can come 935-4 [to him] with his double 3718 bridle? 7448

41:14 Who can open 6605-14 the doors 1817 of his face? 6440 his teeth 8127 [are] terrible 367 round about. 5439

41:15 [His] scales 4043 650 [are his] pride, 1346 shut up together 5462-7 [as with] a close 6862 seal. 2368

41:16 One 259 is so near 5066-4 to another, 259 that no air 7307 can come 935-4 between them.

41:17 They are joined 1692-29 one 376 to another, 251 they stick together, 3920-101 that they cannot be sundered. 6504-101

41:18 By his neesings 5846 a light 216 doth shine, 1984-55 and his eyes 5869 [are] like the eyelids 6079 of the morning. 7837

41:19 Out of his mouth 6310 go 1980-4 burning lamps, 3940 [and] sparks 3590 of fire 784 leap out. 4422-101

41:20 Out of his nostrils 5156 goeth 3318-4 smoke, 6227 as [out] of a seething 5301-7 pot 1731 or caldron. 100

41:21 His breath 5315 kindleth 3857-17 coals, 1513 and a flame 3851 goeth out 3318-4 of his mouth. 6310

41:22 In his neck 6677 remaineth 3885-4 strength, 5797 and sorrow 1670 is turned into joy 1750-4 before 6440 him.

41:23 The flakes 4651 of his flesh 1320 are joined together: 1692-1 they are firm 3332-7 in themselves; they cannot be moved. 4131-11

41:24 His heart 3820 is as firm 3332-7 as a stone; 68 yea, as hard 3332-7 as a piece 6400 of the nether 8482 [millstone].

41:25 When he raiseth up 7613 himself, the mighty 352 are afraid: 1481-4 by reason of breakings 7667 they purify 2398-101 themselves.

41:26 The sword 2719 of him that layeth 5381-56 at him cannot hold: 6965-4 the spear, 2595 the dart, 4551 nor the habergeon. 8302

41:27 He esteemeth 2803-4 iron 1270 as straw, 8401 [and] brass 5154 as rotten 7539 wood. 6086

41:28 The arrow 1121 7198 cannot make him flee: 1272-55 slingstones 68 7050 are turned 2015-8 with him into stubble. 7179

41:29 Darts 8455 are counted 2803-8 as stubble: 7179 he laugheth 7832-4 at the shaking 7494 of a spear. 3591

41:30 Sharp 2303 stones 2789 [are] under him: he spreadeth 7502-4 sharp pointed things 2742 upon the mire. 2916

41:31 He maketh the deep 4688 to boil 7570-55 like a pot: 5518 he maketh 7760-4 the sea 3220 like a pot of ointment. 4841

41:32 He maketh a path 5410 to shine 215-55 after 310 him; [one] would think 2803-4 the deep 8415 [to be] hoary. 7872

41:33 Upon earth 6083 there is not his like, 4915 who is made 6213-7 without 1097 fear. 2844

41:34 He beholdeth 7200-4 all high 1364 [things]: he [is] a king 4428 over all the children 1121 of pride. 7830

42:1 Then Job 347 answered 6030-4 the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4

42:2 I know 3045-1 that thou canst 3201-4 do every [thing], and [that] no thought 4209 can be withholden 1219-11 from thee.

42:3 Who [is] he that hideth 5956-56 counsel 6098 without knowledge? 1847 therefore have I uttered 5046-52 that I understood 995-4 not; things too wonderful 6381-12 for me, which I knew 3045-4 not.

42:4 Hear, 8085-3 I beseech thee, and I will speak: 1696-17 I will demand 7592-4 of thee, and declare 3045-54 thou unto me.

42:5 I have heard 8085-1 of thee by the hearing 8088 of the ear: 241 but now mine eye 5869 seeth 7200-1 thee.

42:6 Wherefore I abhor 3988-4 [myself], and repent 5162-8 in dust 6083 and ashes. 665

42:7 And it was [so], that after 310 the LORD 3068 had spoken 1696-14 these words 1697 unto Job, 347 the LORD 3068 said 559-4 to Eliphaz 464 the Temanite, 8489 My wrath 639 is kindled 2734-1 against thee, and against thy two 8147 friends: 7453 for ye have not spoken 1696-14 of me [the thing that is] right, 3559-12 as my servant 5650 Job 347 [hath].

42:8 Therefore take 3947-3 unto you now seven 7651 bullocks 6499 and seven 7651 rams, 352 and go 3212-3 to my servant 5650 Job, 347 and offer up 5927-52 for yourselves a burnt offering; 5930 and my servant 5650 Job 347 shall pray 6419-101 for you: for him 6440 will I accept: 5375-4 lest I deal 6213-2 with you [after your] folly, 5039 in that ye have not spoken 1696-14 of me [the thing which is] right, 3559-12 like my servant 5650 Job. 347

42:9 So Eliphaz 464 the Temanite 8489 and Bildad 1085 the Shuhite 7747 [and] Zophar 6691 the Naamathite 5284 went, 3212-4 and did 6213-4 according as the LORD 3068 commanded 1696-14 them: the LORD 3068 also accepted 5375-4 6440 Job. 347

42:10 And the LORD 3068 turned 7725-1 the captivity 7622|7622-k of Job, 347 when he prayed 6419-99 for his friends: 7453 also the LORD 3068 gave 3254-55 Job 347 twice as much 4932 as he had before.

42:11 Then came 935-4 there unto him all his brethren, 251 and all his sisters, 269 and all they that had been of his acquaintance 3045-6 before, 6440 and did eat 398-4 bread 3899 with him in his house: 1004 and they bemoaned 5110-4 him, and comforted 5162-17 him over all the evil 7451 that the LORD 3068 had brought 935-52 upon him: every man 376 also gave 5414-4 him a 259 piece of money, 7192 and every one 376 an 259 earring 5141 of gold. 2091

42:12 So the LORD 3068 blessed 1288-14 the latter end 319 of Job 347 more than his beginning: 7225 for he had fourteen 702 6240 thousand 505 sheep, 6629 and six 8337 thousand 505 camels, 1581 and a thousand 505 yoke 6776 of oxen, 1241 and a thousand 505 she asses. 860

42:13 He had also seven 7658 sons 1121 and three 7969 daughters. 1323

42:14 And he called 7121-4 the name 8034 of the first, 259 Jemima; 3224 and the name 8034 of the second, 8145 Kezia; 7103 and the name 8034 of the third, 7992 Kerenhappuch. 7163

42:15 And in all the land 776 were no women 802 found 4672-8 [so] fair 3303 as the daughters 1323 of Job: 347 and their father 1 gave 5414-4 them inheritance 5159 among 8432 their brethren. 251

42:16 After 310 this lived 2421-4 Job 347 an hundred 3967 and forty 705 years, 8141 and saw 7200-4 his sons, 1121 and his sons' 1121 sons, 1121 [even] four 702 generations. 1755

42:17 So Job 347 died, 4191-4 [being] old 2205 and full 7649 of days. 3117
