10:1 Now the Philistines 6430 fought 3898-8 against Israel; 3478 and the men 376 of Israel 3478 fled 5127-4 from before 6440 the Philistines, 6430 and fell down 5307-4 slain 2491 in mount 2022 Gilboa. 1533

10:2 And the Philistines 6430 followed hard 1692-55 after 310 Saul, 7586 and after 310 his sons; 1121 and the Philistines 6430 slew 5221-55 Jonathan, 3129 and Abinadab, 41 and Malchishua, 4444 the sons 1121 of Saul. 7586

10:3 And the battle 4421 went sore 3513-4 against Saul, 7586 and the archers 3384-56 7198 hit 4672-4 him, and he was wounded 2342-4 of the archers. 3384-6

10:4 Then said 559-4 Saul 7586 to his armourbearer, 5375-6 3627 Draw 8025-3 thy sword, 2719 and thrust me through 1856-3 therewith; lest these uncircumcised 6189 come 935-4 and abuse 5953-98 me. But his armourbearer 5375-6 3627 would 14-1 not; for he was sore 3966 afraid. 3372-1 So Saul 7586 took 3947-4 a sword, 2719 and fell 5307-4 upon it.

10:5 And when his armourbearer 5375-6 3627 saw 7200-4 that Saul 7586 was dead, 4191-1 he fell 5307-4 likewise on the sword, 2719 and died. 4191-4

10:6 So Saul 7586 died, 4191-4 and his three 7969 sons, 1121 and all his house 1004 died 4191-1 together. 3162

10:7 And when all the men 376 of Israel 3478 that [were] in the valley 6010 saw 7200-4 that they fled, 5127-1 and that Saul 7586 and his sons 1121 were dead, 4191-1 then they forsook 5800-4 their cities, 5892 and fled: 5127-4 and the Philistines 6430 came 935-4 and dwelt 3427-4 in them.

10:8 And it came to pass on the morrow, 4283 when the Philistines 6430 came 935-4 to strip 6584-15 the slain, 2491 that they found 4672-4 Saul 7586 and his sons 1121 fallen 5307-6 in mount 2022 Gilboa. 1533

10:9 And when they had stripped 6584-55 him, they took 5375-4 his head, 7218 and his armour, 3627 and sent 7971-17 into the land 776 of the Philistines 6430 round about, 5439 to carry tidings 1319-15 unto their idols, 6091 and to the people. 5971

10:10 And they put 7760-4 his armour 3627 in the house 1004 of their gods, 430 and fastened 8628-1 his head 1538 in the temple 1004 of Dagon. 1712

10:11 And when all Jabeshgilead 3003 1568 heard 8085-4 all that the Philistines 6430 had done 6213-1 to Saul, 7586

10:12 They arose, 6965-4 all the valiant 2428 men, 376 and took away 5375-4 the body 1480 of Saul, 7586 and the bodies 1480 of his sons, 1121 and brought 935-55 them to Jabesh, 3003 and buried 6912-4 their bones 6106 under the oak 424 in Jabesh, 3003 and fasted 6684-4 seven 7651 days. 3117

10:13 So Saul 7586 died 4191-4 for his transgression 4604 which he committed 4603-1 against the LORD, 3068 [even] against the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 which he kept 8104-1 not, and also for asking 7592-2 [counsel] of [one that had] a familiar spirit, 178 to enquire 1875-2 [of it];

10:14 And enquired 1875-1 not of the LORD: 3068 therefore he slew 4191-55 him, and turned 5437-55 the kingdom 4410 unto David 1732 the son 1121 of Jesse. 3448

11:1 Then all Israel 3478 gathered 6908-11 themselves to David 1732 unto Hebron, 2275 saying, 559-2 Behold, we [are] thy bone 6106 and thy flesh. 1320

11:2 And moreover 1571 in time past, 8543 8032 even 1571 when Saul 7586 was king, 4428 thou [wast] he that leddest out 3318-56 and broughtest in 935-56 Israel: 3478 and the LORD 3068 thy God 430 said 559-4 unto thee, Thou shalt feed 7462-4 my people 5971 Israel, 3478 and thou shalt be ruler 5057 over my people 5971 Israel. 3478

11:3 Therefore came 935-4 all the elders 2205 of Israel 3478 to the king 4428 to Hebron; 2275 and David 1732 made 3772-4 a covenant 1285 with them in Hebron 2275 before 6440 the LORD; 3068 and they anointed 4886-4 David 1732 king 4428 over Israel, 3478 according to the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 by 3027 Samuel. 8050

11:4 And David 1732 and all Israel 3478 went 3212-4 to Jerusalem, 3389 which [is] Jebus; 2982 where the Jebusites 2983 [were], the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land. 776

11:5 And the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jebus 2982 said 559-4 to David, 1732 Thou shalt not come 935-4 hither. Nevertheless David 1732 took 3920-4 the castle 4686 of Zion, 6726 which [is] the city 5892 of David. 1732

11:6 And David 1732 said, 559-4 Whosoever smiteth 5221-56 the Jebusites 2983 first 7223 shall be chief 7218 and captain. 8269 So Joab 3097 the son 1121 of Zeruiah 6870 went first 7223 up, 5927-4 and was chief. 7218

11:7 And David 1732 dwelt 3427-4 in the castle; 4679 therefore they called 7121-1 it the city 5892 of David. 1732

11:8 And he built 1129-4 the city 5892 round about, 5439 even from Millo 4407 round about: 5439 and Joab 3097 repaired 2421-17 the rest 7605 of the city. 5892

11:9 So David 1732 waxed 3212-4 greater 1980-2 and greater: 1419 for the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 [was] with him.

11:10 These also [are] the chief 7218 of the mighty men 1368 whom David 1732 had, who strengthened 2388-102 themselves with him in his kingdom, 4438 [and] with all Israel, 3478 to make him king, 4427-53 according to the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 concerning Israel. 3478

11:11 And this [is] the number 4557 of the mighty men 1368 whom David 1732 had; Jashobeam, 3434 an Hachmonite, 1121 2453 the chief 7218 of the captains: 7991|7970-k he lifted up 5782-31 his spear 2595 against three 7969 hundred 3967 slain 2491 [by him] at one 259 time. 6471

11:12 And after him 310 [was] Eleazar 499 the son 1121 of Dodo, 1734 the Ahohite, 266 who [was one] of the three 7969 mighties. 1368

11:13 He was with David 1732 at Pasdammim, 6450 and there the Philistines 6430 were gathered 622-8 together to battle, 4421 where was a parcel 2513 of ground 7704 full 4392 of barley; 8184 and the people 5971 fled 5127-1 from before 6440 the Philistines. 6430

11:14 And they set 3320-101 themselves in the midst 8432 of [that] parcel, 2513 and delivered 5337-55 it, and slew 5221-55 the Philistines; 6430 and the LORD 3068 saved 3467-55 [them] by a great 1419 deliverance. 8668

11:15 Now three 7969 of the thirty 7970 captains 7218 went down 3381-4 to the rock 6697 to David, 1732 into the cave 4631 of Adullam; 5725 and the host 4264 of the Philistines 6430 encamped 2583-6 in the valley 6010 of Rephaim. 7497

11:16 And David 1732 [was] then in the hold, 4686 and the Philistines' 6430 garrison 5333 [was] then at Bethlehem. 1035

11:17 And David 1732 longed, 183-101 and said, 559-4 Oh that one would give me drink 8248-55 of the water 4325 of the well 953 of Bethlehem, 1035 that [is] at the gate! 8179

11:18 And the three 7969 brake through 1234-4 the host 4264 of the Philistines, 6430 and drew 7579-4 water 4325 out of the well 953 of Bethlehem, 1035 that [was] by the gate, 8179 and took 5375-4 [it], and brought 935-55 [it] to David: 1732 but David 1732 would 14-1 not drink 8354-2 [of] it, but poured it out 5258-17 to the LORD, 3068

11:19 And said, 559-4 My God 430 forbid 2486 it me, that I should do 6213-2 this thing: 2063 shall I drink 8354-4 the blood 1818 of these men 582 that have put their lives in jeopardy? 5315 for with [the jeopardy of] their lives 5315 they brought 935-52 it. Therefore he would 14-1 not drink 8354-2 it. These things did 6213-1 these three 7969 mightiest. 1368

11:20 And Abishai 52 the brother 251 of Joab, 3097 he was chief 7218 of the three: 7969 for lifting up 5782-31 his spear 2595 against three 7969 hundred, 3967 he slew 2491 [them], and had a name 8034 among the three. 7969

11:21 Of the three, 7969 he was more honourable 3513-12 than the two; 8147 for he was their captain: 8269 howbeit he attained 935-1 not to the [first] three. 7969

11:22 Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada, 3077 the son 1121 of a valiant 2428 man 376 of Kabzeel, 6909 who had done many 7227 acts; 6467 he slew 5221-52 two 8147 lionlike men 739 of Moab: 4124 also he went down 3381-1 and slew 5221-52 a lion 738 in 8432 a pit 953 in a snowy 7950 day. 3117

11:23 And he slew 5221-52 an Egyptian, 4713 376 a man 376 of [great] stature, 4060 five 2568 cubits 520 high; and in the Egyptian's 4713 hand 3027 [was] a spear 2595 like a weaver's 707-6 beam; 4500 and he went down 3381-4 to him with a staff, 7626 and plucked 1497-4 the spear 2595 out of the Egyptian's 4713 hand, 3027 and slew 2026-4 him with his own spear. 2595

11:24 These [things] did 6213-1 Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada, 3077 and had the name 8034 among the three 7969 mighties. 1368

11:25 Behold, 2009 he was honourable 3513-12 among the thirty, 7970 but attained 935-1 not to the [first] three: 7969 and David 1732 set 7760-4 him over his guard. 4928

12:16 And there came 935-4 of the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 and Judah 3063 to the hold 4679 unto David. 1732

12:17 And David 1732 went out 3318-4 to meet 6440 them, and answered 6030-4 and said 559-4 unto them, If ye be come 935-1 peaceably 7965 unto me to help 5826-2 me, mine heart 3824 shall be knit 3162 unto you: but if [ye be come] to betray 7411-15 me to mine enemies, 6862 seeing [there is] no 3808 wrong 2555 in mine hands, 3709 the God 430 of our fathers 1 look 7200-4 [thereon], and rebuke 3198-55 [it].

12:18 Then the spirit 7307 came upon 3847-1 Amasai, 6022 [who was] chief 7218 of the captains, 7991|7970-k [and he said], Thine [are we], David, 1732 and on thy side, thou son 1121 of Jesse: 3448 peace, 7965 peace 7965 [be] unto thee, and peace 7965 [be] to thine helpers; 5826-6 for thy God 430 helpeth 5826-1 thee.

12:19 And there fell 5307-1 [some] of Manasseh 4519 to David, 1732 when he came 935-2 with the Philistines 6430 against Saul 7586 to battle: 4421 but they helped 5826-1 them not: for the lords 5633 of the Philistines 6430 upon advisement 6098 sent him away, 7971-14 saying, 559-2 He will fall 5307-4 to his master 113 Saul 7586 to [the jeopardy of] our heads. 7218

12:22 For at [that] time 6256 day 3117 by day 3117 there came 935-4 to David 1732 to help 5826-2 him, until [it was] a great 1419 host, 4264 like the host 4264 of God. 430

12:23 And these [are] the numbers 4557 of the bands 7218 [that were] ready armed 2502-7 to the war, 6635 [and] came 935-1 to David 1732 to Hebron, 2275 to turn 5437-53 the kingdom 4438 of Saul 7586 to him, according to the word 6310 of the LORD. 3068

13:2 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto all the congregation 6951 of Israel, 3478 If [it seem] good 2895-1 unto you, and [that it be] of the LORD 3068 our God, 430 let us send 7971-4 abroad 6555-4 unto our brethren 251 every where, [that are] left 7604-12 in all the land 776 of Israel, 3478 and with them [also] to the priests 3548 and Levites 3881 [which are] in their cities 5892 [and] suburbs, 4054 that they may gather 6908-11 themselves unto us:

13:3 And let us bring again 5437-55 the ark 727 of our God 430 to us: for we enquired 1875-1 not at it in the days 3117 of Saul. 7586

13:4 And all the congregation 6951 said 559-4 that they would do 6213-2 so: for the thing 1697 was right 3474-1 in the eyes 5869 of all the people. 5971

13:5 So David 1732 gathered all Israel 3478 together, 6950-55 from Shihor 7883 of Egypt 4714 even unto the entering 935-2 of Hemath, 2574 to bring 935-53 the ark 727 of God 430 from Kirjathjearim. 7157

13:6 And David 1732 went up, 5927-4 and all Israel, 3478 to Baalah, 1173 [that is], to Kirjathjearim, 7157 which [belonged] to Judah, 3063 to bring up 5927-53 thence the ark 727 of God 430 the LORD, 3068 that dwelleth 3427-6 [between] the cherubims, 3742 whose name 8034 is called 7121-8 [on it].

13:7 And they carried 7392-55 the ark 727 of God 430 in a new 2319 cart 5699 out of the house 1004 of Abinadab: 41 and Uzza 5798 and Ahio 283 drave 5090-6 the cart. 5699

13:8 And David 1732 and all Israel 3478 played 7832-18 before 6440 God 430 with all [their] might, 5797 and with singing, 7892 and with harps, 3658 and with psalteries, 5035 and with timbrels, 8596 and with cymbals, 4700 and with trumpets. 2689

13:9 And when they came 935-4 unto the threshingfloor 1637 of Chidon, 3592 Uzza 5798 put forth 7971-4 his hand 3027 to hold 270-2 the ark; 727 for the oxen 1241 stumbled. 8058-1

13:10 And the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 was kindled 2734-4 against Uzza, 5798 and he smote 5221-55 him, because he put 7971-1 his hand 3027 to the ark: 727 and there he died 4191-4 before 6440 God. 430

13:11 And David 1732 was displeased, 2734-4 because the LORD 3068 had made 6555-1 a breach 6556 upon Uzza: 5798 wherefore that place 4725 is called 7121-4 Perezuzza 6560 to this day. 3117

13:12 And David 1732 was afraid 3372-4 of God 430 that day, 3117 saying, 559-2 How 1963 shall I bring 935-55 the ark 727 of God 430 [home] to me?

13:13 So David 1732 brought 5493-52 not the ark 727 [home] to himself to the city 5892 of David, 1732 but carried it aside 5186-55 into the house 1004 of Obededom 5654 the Gittite. 1663

13:14 And the ark 727 of God 430 remained 3427-4 with the family 1004 of Obededom 5654 in his house 1004 three 7969 months. 2320 And the LORD 3068 blessed 1288-17 the house 1004 of Obededom, 5654 and all that he had.

14:1 Now Hiram 2438|2361-q king 4428 of Tyre 6865 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 to David, 1732 and timber 6086 of cedars, 730 with masons 2796 7023 and carpenters, 2796 6086 to build 1129-2 him an house. 1004

14:2 And David 1732 perceived 3045-4 that the LORD 3068 had confirmed 3559-52 him king 4428 over Israel, 3478 for his kingdom 4438 was lifted up 5375-8 on high, 4605 because of his people 5971 Israel. 3478

14:3 And David 1732 took 3947-4 more wives 802 at Jerusalem: 3389 and David 1732 begat 3205-55 more sons 1121 and daughters. 1323

14:4 Now these [are] the names 8034 of [his] children 3205-7 which he had in Jerusalem; 3389 Shammua, 8051 and Shobab, 7727 Nathan, 5416 and Solomon, 8010

14:5 And Ibhar, 2984 and Elishua, 474 and Elpalet, 467

14:6 And Nogah, 5052 and Nepheg, 5298 and Japhia, 3309

14:7 And Elishama, 476 and Beeliada, 1182 and Eliphalet. 467

14:8 And when the Philistines 6430 heard 8085-4 that David 1732 was anointed 4886-8 king 4428 over all Israel, 3478 all the Philistines 6430 went up 5927-4 to seek 1245-15 David. 1732 And David 1732 heard 8085-4 [of it], and went out 3318-4 against 6440 them.

14:9 And the Philistines 6430 came 935-1 and spread 6584-4 themselves in the valley 6010 of Rephaim. 7497

14:10 And David 1732 enquired 7592-4 of God, 430 saying, 559-2 Shall I go up 5927-4 against the Philistines? 6430 and wilt thou deliver 5414-1 them into mine hand? 3027 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, Go up; 5927-3 for I will deliver 5414-1 them into thine hand. 3027

14:11 So they came up 5927-4 to Baalperazim; 1188 and David 1732 smote 5221-55 them there. Then David 1732 said, 559-4 God 430 hath broken in 6555-1 upon mine enemies 341-6 by mine hand 3027 like the breaking forth 6556 of waters: 4325 therefore they called 7121-1 the name 8034 of that place 4725 Baalperazim. 1188

14:12 And when they had left 5800-4 their gods 430 there, David 1732 gave a commandment, 559-4 and they were burned 8313-11 with fire. 784

14:13 And the Philistines 6430 yet again 3254-55 spread themselves abroad 6584-4 in the valley. 6010

14:14 Therefore David 1732 enquired 7592-4 again of God; 430 and God 430 said 559-4 unto him, Go not up 5927-4 after 310 them; turn away 5437-54 from them, and come 935-1 upon them over against 4136 the mulberry trees. 1057

14:15 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear 8085-2 a sound 6963 of going 6807 in the tops 7218 of the mulberry trees, 1057 [that] then thou shalt go out 3318-4 to battle: 4421 for God 430 is gone forth 3318-1 before 6440 thee to smite 5221-53 the host 4264 of the Philistines. 6430

14:16 David 1732 therefore did 6213-4 as God 430 commanded 6680-14 him: and they smote 5221-55 the host 4264 of the Philistines 6430 from Gibeon 1391 even to Gazer. 1507

14:17 And the fame 8034 of David 1732 went out 3318-4 into all lands; 776 and the LORD 3068 brought 5414-1 the fear 6343 of him upon all nations. 1471

15:1 And [David] made 6213-4 him houses 1004 in the city 5892 of David, 1732 and prepared 3559-55 a place 4725 for the ark 727 of God, 430 and pitched 5186-4 for it a tent. 168

15:2 Then David 1732 said, 559-1 None ought to carry 5375-2 the ark 727 of God 430 but the Levites: 3881 for them hath the LORD 3068 chosen 977-1 to carry 5375-2 the ark 727 of God, 430 and to minister 8334-15 unto him for 5704 ever. 5769

15:3 And David 1732 gathered all Israel 3478 together 6950-55 to Jerusalem, 3389 to bring up 5927-53 the ark 727 of the LORD 3068 unto his place, 4725 which he had prepared 3559-52 for it.

15:4 And David 1732 assembled 622-4 the children 1121 of Aaron, 175 and the Levites: 3881

15:5 Of the sons 1121 of Kohath; 6955 Uriel 222 the chief, 8269 and his brethren 251 an hundred 3967 and twenty: 6242

15:6 Of the sons 1121 of Merari; 4847 Asaiah 6222 the chief, 8269 and his brethren 251 two hundred 3967 and twenty: 6242

15:7 Of the sons 1121 of Gershom; 1647 Joel 3100 the chief, 8269 and his brethren 251 an hundred 3967 and thirty: 7970

15:8 Of the sons 1121 of Elizaphan; 469 Shemaiah 8098 the chief, 8269 and his brethren 251 two hundred: 3967

15:9 Of the sons 1121 of Hebron; 2275 Eliel 447 the chief, 8269 and his brethren 251 fourscore: 8084

15:10 Of the sons 1121 of Uzziel; 5816 Amminadab 5992 the chief, 8269 and his brethren 251 an hundred 3967 and twelve. 8147 6240

15:11 And David 1732 called 7121-4 for Zadok 6659 and Abiathar 54 the priests, 3548 and for the Levites, 3881 for Uriel, 222 Asaiah, 6222 and Joel, 3100 Shemaiah, 8098 and Eliel, 447 and Amminadab, 5992

15:12 And said 559-4 unto them, Ye [are] the chief 7218 of the fathers 1 of the Levites: 3881 sanctify 6942-100 yourselves, [both] ye and your brethren, 251 that ye may bring up 5927-52 the ark 727 of the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 unto [the place that] I have prepared 3559-52 for it.

15:13 For because ye [did it] not at the first, 7223 the LORD 3068 our God 430 made a breach 6555-1 upon us, for that we sought 1875-1 him not after the due order. 4941

15:14 So the priests 3548 and the Levites 3881 sanctified 6942-101 themselves to bring up 5927-53 the ark 727 of the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel. 3478

15:15 And the children 1121 of the Levites 3881 bare 5375-4 the ark 727 of God 430 upon their shoulders 3802 with the staves 4133 thereon, as Moses 4872 commanded 6680-14 according to the word 1697 of the LORD. 3068

15:16 And David 1732 spake 559-4 to the chief 8269 of the Levites 3881 to appoint 5975-53 their brethren 251 [to be] the singers 7891-35 with instruments 3627 of musick, 7892 psalteries 5035 and harps 3658 and cymbals, 4700 sounding, 8085-56 by lifting up 7311-53 the voice 6963 with joy. 8057

15:17 So the Levites 3881 appointed 5975-55 Heman 1968 the son 1121 of Joel; 3100 and of his brethren, 251 Asaph 623 the son 1121 of Berechiah; 1296 and of the sons 1121 of Merari 4847 their brethren, 251 Ethan 387 the son 1121 of Kushaiah; 6984

15:18 And with them their brethren 251 of the second 4932 [degree], Zechariah, 2148 Ben, 1122 and Jaaziel, 3268 and Shemiramoth, 8070 and Jehiel, 3171 and Unni, 6042 Eliab, 446 and Benaiah, 1141 and Maaseiah, 4641 and Mattithiah, 4993 and Elipheleh, 466 and Mikneiah, 4737 and Obededom, 5654 and Jeiel, 3273 the porters. 7778

15:19 So the singers, 7891-35 Heman, 1968 Asaph, 623 and Ethan, 387 [were appointed] to sound 8085-53 with cymbals 4700 of brass; 5178

15:20 And Zechariah, 2148 and Aziel, 5815 and Shemiramoth, 8070 and Jehiel, 3171 and Unni, 6042 and Eliab, 446 and Maaseiah, 4641 and Benaiah, 1141 with psalteries 5035 on Alamoth; 5961

15:21 And Mattithiah, 4993 and Elipheleh, 466 and Mikneiah, 4737 and Obededom, 5654 and Jeiel, 3273 and Azaziah, 5812 with harps 3658 on the Sheminith 8067|8066 to excel. 5329-15

15:22 And Chenaniah, 3663 chief 8269 of the Levites, 3881 [was] for song: 4853 he instructed 3256 about the song, 4853 because he [was] skilful. 995-56

15:23 And Berechiah 1296 and Elkanah 511 [were] doorkeepers 7778 for the ark. 727

15:24 And Shebaniah, 7645 and Jehoshaphat, 3146 and Nethaneel, 5417 and Amasai, 6022 and Zechariah, 2148 and Benaiah, 1141 and Eliezer, 461 the priests, 3548 did blow 2690-56|2690-18-k with the trumpets 2689 before 6440 the ark 727 of God: 430 and Obededom 5654 and Jehiah 3174 [were] doorkeepers 7778 for the ark. 727

15:25 So David, 1732 and the elders 2205 of Israel, 3478 and the captains 8269 over thousands, 505 went 1980-6 to bring up 5927-53 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 out of the house 1004 of Obededom 5654 with joy. 8057

15:26 And it came to pass, when God 430 helped 5826-2 the Levites 3881 that bare 5375-6 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD, 3068 that they offered 2076-4 seven 7651 bullocks 6499 and seven 7651 rams. 352

15:27 And David 1732 [was] clothed 3736-7 with a robe 4598 of fine linen, 948 and all the Levites 3881 that bare 5375-6 the ark, 727 and the singers, 7891-35 and Chenaniah 3663 the master 8269 of the song 4853 with the singers: 7891-35 David 1732 also [had] upon him an ephod 646 of linen. 906

15:28 Thus all Israel 3478 brought up 5927-56 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 with shouting, 8643 and with sound 6963 of the cornet, 7782 and with trumpets, 2689 and with cymbals, 4700 making a noise 8085-56 with psalteries 5035 and harps. 3658

15:29 And it came to pass, [as] the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 came 935-1 to the city 5892 of David, 1732 that Michal 4324 the daughter 1323 of Saul 7586 looking 8259-8 out at a window 2474 saw 7200-4 king 4428 David 1732 dancing 7540-18 and playing: 7832-18 and she despised 959-4 him in her heart. 3820

16:1 So they brought 935-55 the ark 727 of God, 430 and set 3322-55 it in the midst 8432 of the tent 168 that David 1732 had pitched 5186-1 for it: and they offered 7126-55 burnt sacrifices 5930 and peace offerings 8002 before 6440 God. 430

16:2 And when David 1732 had made an end 3615-17 of offering 5927-53 the burnt offerings 5930 and the peace offerings, 8002 he blessed 1288-17 the people 5971 in the name 8034 of the LORD. 3068

16:3 And he dealt 2505-17 to every one 376 of Israel, 3478 both man 376 and woman, 802 to every one 376 a loaf 3603 of bread, 3899 and a good piece 829 of flesh, and a flagon 809 [of wine].

16:4 And he appointed 5414-4 [certain] of the Levites 3881 to minister 8334-18 before 6440 the ark 727 of the LORD, 3068 and to record, 2142-53 and to thank 3034-53 and praise 1984-15 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel: 3478

16:5 Asaph 623 the chief, 7218 and next 4932 to him Zechariah, 2148 Jeiel, 3273 and Shemiramoth, 8070 and Jehiel, 3171 and Mattithiah, 4993 and Eliab, 446 and Benaiah, 1141 and Obededom: 5654 and Jeiel 3273 with 3627 psalteries 5035 and with harps; 3658 but Asaph 623 made a sound 8085-56 with cymbals; 4700

16:6 Benaiah 1141 also and Jahaziel 3166 the priests 3548 with trumpets 2689 continually 8548 before 6440 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of God. 430

16:7 Then on that day 3117 David 1732 delivered 5414-1 first 7218 [this psalm] to thank 3034-53 the LORD 3068 into the hand 3027 of Asaph 623 and his brethren. 251

16:8 Give thanks 3034-54 unto the LORD, 3068 call 7121-3 upon his name, 8034 make known 3045-54 his deeds 5949 among the people. 5971

16:9 Sing 7891-3 unto him, sing psalms 2167-16 unto him, talk 7878-3 ye of all his wondrous works. 6381-12

16:10 Glory 1984-100 ye in his holy 6944 name: 8034 let the heart 3820 of them rejoice 8055-4 that seek 1245-18 the LORD. 3068

16:11 Seek 1875-3 the LORD 3068 and his strength, 5797 seek 1245-16 his face 6440 continually. 8548

16:12 Remember 2142-3 his marvellous works 6381-12 that he hath done, 6213-1 his wonders, 4159 and the judgments 4941 of his mouth; 6310

16:13 O ye seed 2233 of Israel 3478 his servant, 5650 ye children 1121 of Jacob, 3290 his chosen ones. 972

16:14 He [is] the LORD 3068 our God; 430 his judgments 4941 [are] in all the earth. 776

16:15 Be ye mindful 2142-3 always 5769 of his covenant; 1285 the word 1697 [which] he commanded 6680-14 to a thousand 505 generations; 1755

16:16 [Even of the covenant] which he made 3772-1 with Abraham, 85 and of his oath 7621 unto Isaac; 3327

16:17 And hath confirmed 5975-55 the same to Jacob 3290 for a law, 2706 [and] to Israel 3478 [for] an everlasting 5769 covenant, 1285

16:18 Saying, 559-2 Unto thee will I give 5414-4 the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 the lot 2256 of your inheritance; 5159

16:19 When ye were but few, 4557 4962 even a few, 4592 and strangers 1481-6 in it.

16:20 And [when] they went 1980-101 from nation 1471 to nation, 1471 and from [one] kingdom 4467 to another 312 people; 5971

16:21 He suffered 3240-52 no man 376 to do them wrong: 6231-2 yea, he reproved 3198-55 kings 4428 for their sakes,

16:22 [Saying], Touch 5060-4 not mine anointed, 4899 and do my prophets 5030 no harm. 7489-55

16:23 Sing 7891-3 unto the LORD, 3068 all the earth; 776 shew forth 1319-16 from day 3117 to day 3117 his salvation. 3444

16:24 Declare 5608-16 his glory 3519 among the heathen; 1471 his marvellous works 6381-12 among all nations. 5971

16:25 For great 1419 [is] the LORD, 3068 and greatly 3966 to be praised: 1984-30 he also [is] to be feared 3372-12 above all gods. 430

16:26 For all the gods 430 of the people 5971 [are] idols: 457 but the LORD 3068 made 6213-1 the heavens. 8064

16:27 Glory 1935 and honour 1926 [are] in his presence; 6440 strength 5797 and gladness 2304 [are] in his place. 4725

16:28 Give 3051-3 unto the LORD, 3068 ye kindreds 4940 of the people, 5971 give 3051-3 unto the LORD 3068 glory 3519 and strength. 5797

16:29 Give 3051-3 unto the LORD 3068 the glory 3519 [due] unto his name: 8034 bring 5375-3 an offering, 4503 and come 935-3 before 6440 him: worship 7812-100 the LORD 3068 in the beauty 1927 of holiness. 6944

16:30 Fear 2342-3 before 6440 him, all the earth: 776 the world 8398 also shall be stable, 3559-11 that it be not moved. 4131-11

16:31 Let the heavens 8064 be glad, 8055-4 and let the earth 776 rejoice: 1523-4 and let [men] say 559-4 among the nations, 1471 The LORD 3068 reigneth. 4427-1

16:32 Let the sea 3220 roar, 7481-4 and the fulness 4393 thereof: let the fields 7704 rejoice, 5970-4 and all that [is] therein.

16:33 Then shall the trees 6086 of the wood 3293 sing out 7442-17 at the presence 6440 of the LORD, 3068 because he cometh 935-1 to judge 8199-2 the earth. 776

16:34 O give thanks 3034-54 unto the LORD; 3068 for [he is] good; 2896 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

16:35 And say 559-3 ye, Save 3467-54 us, O God 430 of our salvation, 3468 and gather us together, 6908-16 and deliver 5337-54 us from the heathen, 1471 that we may give thanks 3034-53 to thy holy 6944 name, 8034 [and] glory 7623-99 in thy praise. 8416

16:36 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 for ever 5769 and ever. 5769 And all the people 5971 said, 559-4 Amen, 543 and praised 1984-15 the LORD. 3068

16:37 So he left 5800-4 there before 6440 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 Asaph 623 and his brethren, 251 to minister 8334-15 before 6440 the ark 727 continually, 8548 as every day's 3117 3117 work 1697 required:

16:38 And Obededom 5654 with their brethren, 251 threescore 8346 and eight; 8083 Obededom 5654 also the son 1121 of Jeduthun 3038 and Hosah 2621 [to be] porters: 7778

16:39 And Zadok 6659 the priest, 3548 and his brethren 251 the priests, 3548 before 6440 the tabernacle 4908 of the LORD 3068 in the high place 1116 that [was] at Gibeon, 1391

16:40 To offer 5927-53 burnt offerings 5930 unto the LORD 3068 upon the altar 4196 of the burnt offering 5930 continually 8548 morning 1242 1242 and evening, 6153 and [to do] according to all that is written 3789-7 in the law 8451 of the LORD, 3068 which he commanded 6680-14 Israel; 3478

16:41 And with them Heman 1968 and Jeduthun, 3038 and the rest 7605 that were chosen, 1305-7 who were expressed 5344-8 by name, 8034 to give thanks 3034-53 to the LORD, 3068 because his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever; 5769

16:42 And with them Heman 1968 and Jeduthun 3038 with trumpets 2689 and cymbals 4700 for those that should make a sound, 8085-56 and with musical 7892 instruments 3627 of God. 430 And the sons 1121 of Jeduthun 3038 [were] porters. 8179

16:43 And all the people 5971 departed 3212-4 every man 376 to his house: 1004 and David 1732 returned 5437-11 to bless 1288-15 his house. 1004

17:1 Now it came to pass, as David 1732 sat 3427-1 in his house, 1004 that David 1732 said 559-4 to Nathan 5416 the prophet, 5030 Lo, I dwell 3427-6 in an house 1004 of cedars, 730 but the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 [remaineth] under curtains. 3407

17:2 Then Nathan 5416 said 559-4 unto David, 1732 Do 6213-3 all that [is] in thine heart; 3824 for God 430 [is] with thee.

17:3 And it came to pass the same night, 3915 that the word 1697 of God 430 came to Nathan, 5416 saying, 559-2

17:4 Go 3212-3 and tell 559-1 David 1732 my servant, 5650 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Thou shalt not build 1129-4 me an house 1004 to dwell in: 3427-2

17:5 For I have not dwelt 3427-1 in an house 1004 since the day 3117 that I brought up 5927-52 Israel 3478 unto this day; 3117 but have gone from tent 168 to tent, 168 and from [one] tabernacle 4908 [to another].

17:6 Wheresoever I have walked 1980-98 with all Israel, 3478 spake 1696-14 I a word 1697 to any 259 of the judges 8199-6 of Israel, 3478 whom I commanded 6680-14 to feed 7462-2 my people, 5971 saying, 559-2 Why have ye not built 1129-1 me an house 1004 of cedars? 730

17:7 Now therefore thus shalt thou say 559-4 unto my servant 5650 David, 1732 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 I took 3947-1 thee from the sheepcote, 5116 [even] from following 310 the sheep, 6629 that thou shouldest be ruler 5057 over my people 5971 Israel: 3478

17:8 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, 1980-1 and have cut off 3772-55 all thine enemies 341-6 from before 6440 thee, and have made 6213-1 thee a name 8034 like the name 8034 of the great men 1419 that [are] in the earth. 776

17:9 Also I will ordain 7760-1 a place 4725 for my people 5971 Israel, 3478 and will plant 5193-1 them, and they shall dwell 7931-1 in their place, and shall be moved 7264-4 no more; neither shall the children 1121 of wickedness 5766 waste 1086-15 them any more, 3254-55 as at the beginning, 7223

17:10 And since the time 3117 that I commanded 6680-14 judges 8199-6 [to be] over my people 5971 Israel. 3478 Moreover I will subdue 3665-52 all thine enemies. 341-6 Furthermore I tell 5046-55 thee that the LORD 3068 will build 1129-4 thee an house. 1004

17:11 And it shall come to pass, when thy days 3117 be expired 4390-1 that thou must go 3212-2 [to be] with thy fathers, 1 that I will raise up 6965-52 thy seed 2233 after 310 thee, which shall be of thy sons; 1121 and I will establish 3559-52 his kingdom. 4438

17:12 He shall build 1129-4 me an house, 1004 and I will stablish 3559-31 his throne 3678 for 5704 ever. 5769

17:13 I will be his father, 1 and he shall be my son: 1121 and I will not take my mercy 2617 away 5493-55 from him, as I took 5493-52 [it] from [him] that was before 6440 thee:

17:14 But I will settle 5975-52 him in mine house 1004 and in my kingdom 4438 for ever: 5769 and his throne 3678 shall be established 3559-12 for 5704 evermore. 5769

17:15 According to all these words, 1697 and according to all this vision, 2377 so did Nathan 5416 speak 1696-14 unto David. 1732

17:16 And David 1732 the king 4428 came 935-4 and sat 3427-4 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 Who [am] I, O LORD 3068 God, 430 and what [is] mine house, 1004 that thou hast brought 935-52 me hitherto? 1988

17:17 And [yet] this was a small thing 6994-4 in thine eyes, 5869 O God; 430 for thou hast [also] spoken 1696-17 of thy servant's 5650 house 1004 for a great while to come, 7350 and hast regarded 7200-1 me according to the estate 8448 of a man 120 of high degree, 4609 O LORD 3068 God. 430

17:18 What can David 1732 [speak] more 3254-55 to thee for the honour 3519 of thy servant? 5650 for thou knowest 3045-1 thy servant. 5650

17:19 O LORD, 3068 for thy servant's 5650 sake, and according to thine own heart, 3820 hast thou done 6213-1 all this greatness, 1420 in making known 3045-53 all [these] great things. 1420

17:20 O LORD, 3068 [there is] none like thee, neither [is there any] God 430 beside 2108 thee, according to all that we have heard 8085-1 with our ears. 241

17:21 And what one 259 nation 1471 in the earth 776 [is] like thy people 5971 Israel, 3478 whom God 430 went 1980-1 to redeem 6299-2 [to be] his own people, 5971 to make 7760-2 thee a name 8034 of greatness 1420 and terribleness, 3372-12 by driving out 1644-15 nations 1471 from before 6440 thy people, 5971 whom thou hast redeemed 6299-1 out of Egypt? 4714

17:22 For thy people 5971 Israel 3478 didst thou make 5414-4 thine own people 5971 for 5704 ever; 5769 and thou, LORD, 3068 becamest their God. 430

17:23 Therefore now, LORD, 3068 let the thing 1697 that thou hast spoken 1696-14 concerning thy servant 5650 and concerning his house 1004 be established 539-11 for 5704 ever, 5769 and do 6213-3 as thou hast said. 1696-14

17:24 Let it even be established, 539-11 that thy name 8034 may be magnified 1431-4 for 5704 ever, 5769 saying, 559-2 The LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 [is] the God 430 of Israel, 3478 [even] a God 430 to Israel: 3478 and [let] the house 1004 of David 1732 thy servant 5650 [be] established 3559-12 before 6440 thee.

17:25 For thou, O my God, 430 hast told 1540-1 241 thy servant 5650 that thou wilt build 1129-2 him an house: 1004 therefore thy servant 5650 hath found 4672-1 [in his heart] to pray 6419-99 before 6440 thee.

17:26 And now, LORD, 3068 thou art God, 430 and hast promised 1696-17 this goodness 2896 unto thy servant: 5650

17:27 Now therefore let it please 2974-52 thee to bless 1288-15 the house 1004 of thy servant, 5650 that it may be before 6440 thee for ever: 5769 for thou blessest, 1288-14 O LORD, 3068 and [it shall be] blessed 1288-30 for ever. 5769

18:1 Now after 310 this it came to pass, that David 1732 smote 5221-55 the Philistines, 6430 and subdued 3665-55 them, and took 3947-4 Gath 1661 and her towns 1323 out of the hand 3027 of the Philistines. 6430

18:2 And he smote 5221-55 Moab; 4124 and the Moabites 4124 became David's 1732 servants, 5650 [and] brought 5375-6 gifts. 4503

18:3 And David 1732 smote 5221-55 Hadarezer 1928 king 4428 of Zobah 6678 unto Hamath, 2574 as he went 3212-2 to stablish 5324-53 his dominion 3027 by the river 5104 Euphrates. 6578

18:4 And David 1732 took 3920-4 from him a thousand 505 chariots, 7393 and seven 7651 thousand 505 horsemen, 6571 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 footmen: 376 7273 David 1732 also houghed 6131-17 all the chariot 7393 [horses], but reserved 3498-55 of them an hundred 3967 chariots. 7393

18:5 And when the Syrians 758 of Damascus 1834 came 935-4 to help 5826-2 Hadarezer 1928 king 4428 of Zobah, 6678 David 1732 slew 5221-55 of the Syrians 758 two 8147 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 men. 376

18:6 Then David 1732 put 7760-4 [garrisons] in Syriadamascus; 758 1834 and the Syrians 758 became David's 1732 servants, 5650 [and] brought 5375-6 gifts. 4503 Thus the LORD 3068 preserved 3467-55 David 1732 whithersoever he went. 1980-1

18:7 And David 1732 took 3947-4 the shields 7982 of gold 2091 that were on the servants 5650 of Hadarezer, 1928 and brought 935-55 them to Jerusalem. 3389

18:8 Likewise from Tibhath, 2880 and from Chun, 3560 cities 5892 of Hadarezer, 1928 brought 3947-1 David 1732 very 3966 much 7227 brass, 5178 wherewith Solomon 8010 made 6213-1 the brasen 5178 sea, 3220 and the pillars, 5982 and the vessels 3627 of brass. 5178

18:9 Now when Tou 8583 king 4428 of Hamath 2574 heard 8085-4 how David 1732 had smitten 5221-52 all the host 2428 of Hadarezer 1928 king 4428 of Zobah; 6678

18:10 He sent 7971-4 Hadoram 1913 his son 1121 to king 4428 David, 1732 to enquire 7592-2 of his welfare, 7965 and to congratulate 1288-15 him, because he had fought 3898-8 against Hadarezer, 1928 and smitten 5221-55 him; (for Hadarezer 1928 had war 376 4421 with Tou;) 8583 and [with him] all manner of vessels 3627 of gold 2091 and silver 3701 and brass. 5178

18:11 Them also king 4428 David 1732 dedicated 6942-52 unto the LORD, 3068 with the silver 3701 and the gold 2091 that he brought 5375-1 from all [these] nations; 1471 from Edom, 123 and from Moab, 4124 and from the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 and from the Philistines, 6430 and from Amalek. 6002

18:12 Moreover Abishai 52 the son 1121 of Zeruiah 6870 slew 5221-52 of the Edomites 123 in the valley 1516 of salt 4417 eighteen 8083 6240 thousand. 505

18:13 And he put 7760-4 garrisons 5333 in Edom; 123 and all the Edomites 123 became David's 1732 servants. 5650 Thus the LORD 3068 preserved 3467-55 David 1732 whithersoever he went. 1980-1

18:14 So David 1732 reigned 4427-4 over all Israel, 3478 and executed 6213-6 judgment 4941 and justice 6666 among all his people. 5971

18:15 And Joab 3097 the son 1121 of Zeruiah 6870 [was] over the host; 6635 and Jehoshaphat 3092 the son 1121 of Ahilud, 286 recorder. 2142-56

18:16 And Zadok 6659 the son 1121 of Ahitub, 285 and Abimelech 40 the son 1121 of Abiathar, 54 [were] the priests; 3548 and Shavsha 7798 was scribe; 5608-6

18:17 And Benaiah 1141 the son 1121 of Jehoiada 3077 [was] over the Cherethites 3774 and the Pelethites; 6432 and the sons 1121 of David 1732 [were] chief 7223 about 3027 the king. 4428

19:1 Now it came to pass after 310 this, that Nahash 5176 the king 4428 of the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 died, 4191-4 and his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

19:2 And David 1732 said, 559-4 I will shew 6213-4 kindness 2617 unto Hanun 2586 the son 1121 of Nahash, 5176 because his father 1 shewed 6213-1 kindness 2617 to me. And David 1732 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 to comfort 5162-15 him concerning his father. 1 So the servants 5650 of David 1732 came 935-4 into the land 776 of the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 to Hanun, 2586 to comfort 5162-15 him.

19:3 But the princes 8269 of the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 said 559-4 to Hanun, 2586 Thinkest 5869 thou that David 1732 doth honour 3513-18 thy father, 1 that he hath sent 7971-1 comforters 5162-18 unto thee? are not his servants 5650 come 935-1 unto thee for to search, 2713-2 and to overthrow, 2015-2 and to spy out 7270-15 the land? 776

19:4 Wherefore Hanun 2586 took 3947-4 David's 1732 servants, 5650 and shaved 1548-17 them, and cut off 3772-4 their garments 4063 in the midst 2677 hard by their buttocks, 4667 and sent them away. 7971-17

19:5 Then there went 3212-4 [certain], and told 5046-55 David 1732 how the men 582 were served. And he sent 7971-4 to meet 7125-2 them: for the men 582 were greatly 3966 ashamed. 3637-12 And the king 4428 said, 559-4 Tarry 3427-3 at Jericho 3405 until your beards 2206 be grown, 6779-17 and [then] return. 7725-1

19:6 And when the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 saw 7200-4 that they had made themselves odious 887-98 to David, 1732 Hanun 2586 and the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 sent 7971-4 a thousand 505 talents 3603 of silver 3701 to hire 7936-2 them chariots 7393 and horsemen 6571 out of Mesopotamia, 763 and out of Syriamaachah, 758 4601 and out of Zobah. 6678

19:7 So they hired 7936-4 thirty 7970 and two 8147 thousand 505 chariots, 7393 and the king 4428 of Maachah 4601 and his people; 5971 who came 935-4 and pitched 2583-4 before 6440 Medeba. 4311 And the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 gathered 622-8 themselves together from their cities, 5892 and came 935-4 to battle. 4421

19:8 And when David 1732 heard 8085-4 [of it], he sent 7971-4 Joab, 3097 and all the host 6635 of the mighty men. 1368

19:9 And the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 came out, 3318-4 and put the battle 4421 in array 6186-4 before the gate 6607 of the city: 5892 and the kings 4428 that were come 935-1 [were] by themselves in the field. 7704

19:10 Now when Joab 3097 saw 7200-4 that the 6440 battle 4421 was set against him before 6440 and behind, 268 he chose 977-4 out of all the choice 977-7 of Israel, 3478 and put [them] in array 6186-4 against 7125-2 the Syrians. 758

19:11 And the rest 3499 of the people 5971 he delivered 5414-1 unto the hand 3027 of Abishai 52 his brother, 251 and they set [themselves] in array 6186-4 against 7125-2 the children 1121 of Ammon. 5983

19:12 And he said, 559-4 If the Syrians 758 be too strong 2388-4 for me, then thou shalt help 8668 me: but if the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 be too strong 2388-4 for thee, then I will help 3467-52 thee.

19:13 Be of good courage, 2388-3 and let us behave ourselves valiantly 2388-101 for our people, 5971 and for the cities 5892 of our God: 430 and let the LORD 3068 do 6213-4 [that which is] good 2896 in his sight. 5869

19:14 So Joab 3097 and the people 5971 that [were] with him drew nigh 5066-4 before 6440 the Syrians 758 unto the battle; 4421 and they fled 5127-4 before 6440 him.

19:15 And when the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 saw 7200-1 that the Syrians 758 were fled, 5127-1 they likewise fled 5127-4 before 6440 Abishai 52 his brother, 251 and entered 935-4 into the city. 5892 Then Joab 3097 came 935-4 to Jerusalem. 3389

19:16 And when the Syrians 758 saw 7200-4 that they were put to the worse 5062-8 before 6440 Israel, 3478 they sent 7971-4 messengers, 4397 and drew forth 3318-55 the Syrians 758 that [were] beyond 5676 the river: 5104 and Shophach 7780 the captain 8269 of the host 6635 of Hadarezer 1928 [went] before 6440 them.

19:17 And it was told 5046-93 David; 1732 and he gathered 622-4 all Israel, 3478 and passed over 5674-4 Jordan, 3383 and came 935-4 upon them, and set [the battle] in array 6186-4 against them. So when David 1732 had put the battle 4421 in array 6186-4 against 7125-2 the Syrians, 758 they fought 3898-11 with him.

19:18 But the Syrians 758 fled 5127-4 before 6440 Israel; 3478 and David 1732 slew 2026-4 of the Syrians 758 seven 7651 thousand 505 [men which fought in] chariots, 7393 and forty 705 thousand 505 footmen, 376 7273 and killed 4191-52 Shophach 7780 the captain 8269 of the host. 6635

19:19 And when the servants 5650 of Hadarezer 1928 saw 7200-4 that they were put to the worse 5062-8 before 6440 Israel, 3478 they made peace 7999-55 with David, 1732 and became his servants: 5647-4 neither would 14-1 the Syrians 758 help 3467-53 the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 any more.

20:1 And it came to pass, that after 6256 the year 8141 was expired, 8666 at the time 6256 that kings 4428 go out 3318-2 [to battle], Joab 3097 led forth 5090-4 the power 2428 of the army, 6635 and wasted 7843-55 the country 776 of the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 and came 935-4 and besieged 6696-4 Rabbah. 7237 But David 1732 tarried 3427-6 at Jerusalem. 3389 And Joab 3097 smote 5221-55 Rabbah, 7237 and destroyed 2040-4 it.

20:2 And David 1732 took 3947-4 the crown 5850 of their king 4428 from off his head, 7218 and found 4672-4 it to weigh 4948 a talent 3603 of gold, 2091 and [there were] precious 3368 stones 68 in it; and it was set upon David's 1732 head: 7218 and he brought also exceeding 3966 much 7235-53 spoil 7998 out 3318-52 of the city. 5892

20:3 And he brought out 3318-52 the people 5971 that [were] in it, and cut 7787-4 [them] with saws, 4050 and with harrows 2757 of iron, 1270 and with axes. 4050 Even so dealt 6213-4 David 1732 with all the cities 5892 of the children 1121 of Ammon. 5983 And David 1732 and all the people 5971 returned 7725-4 to Jerusalem. 3389

20:4 And it came to pass after 310 this, that there arose 5975-4 war 4421 at Gezer 1507 with the Philistines; 6430 at which time 227 Sibbechai 5444 the Hushathite 2843 slew 5221-52 Sippai, 5598 [that was] of the children 3211 of the giant: 7498 and they were subdued. 3665-11

20:5 And there was war 4421 again with the Philistines; 6430 and Elhanan 445 the son 1121 of Jair 3265 slew 5221-55 Lahmi 3902 the brother 251 of Goliath 1555 the Gittite, 1663 whose spear 2595 staff 6086 [was] like a weaver's 707-6 beam. 4500

20:6 And yet again there was war 4421 at Gath, 1661 where was a man 376 of [great] stature, 4060 whose fingers and toes 676 [were] four 702 and twenty, 6242 six 8337 [on each hand], and six 8337 [on each foot]: and he also was the son 3205-8 of the giant. 7498

20:7 But when he defied 2778-17 Israel, 3478 Jonathan 3083 the son 1121 of Shimea 8092 David's 1732 brother 251 slew 5221-55 him.

20:8 These 411 were born 3205-8 unto the giant 7498 in Gath; 1661 and they fell 5307-4 by the hand 3027 of David, 1732 and by the hand 3027 of his servants. 5650

21:1 And Satan 7854 stood up 5975-4 against Israel, 3478 and provoked 5496-55 David 1732 to number 4487-2 Israel. 3478

21:2 And David 1732 said 559-4 to Joab 3097 and to the rulers 8269 of the people, 5971 Go, 3212-3 number 5608-3 Israel 3478 from Beersheba 884 even to Dan; 1835 and bring 935-54 the number 4557 of them to me, that I may know 3045-4 [it].

21:3 And Joab 3097 answered, 559-4 The LORD 3068 make his people 5971 an hundred 3967 times 6471 so many more 3254-55 as they 1992 [be]: but, my lord 113 the king, 4428 [are] they not all my lord's 113 servants? 5650 why then doth my lord 113 require 1245-17 this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass 819 to Israel? 3478

21:4 Nevertheless the king's 4428 word 1697 prevailed 2388-1 against Joab. 3097 Wherefore Joab 3097 departed, 3318-4 and went 1980-101 throughout all Israel, 3478 and came 935-4 to Jerusalem. 3389

21:5 And Joab 3097 gave 5414-4 the sum 4557 of the number 4662 of the people 5971 unto David. 1732 And all [they of] Israel 3478 were a thousand 505 thousand 505 and an hundred 3967 thousand 505 men 376 that drew 8025-6 sword: 2719 and Judah 3063 [was] four 702 hundred 3967 threescore and ten 7657 thousand 505 men 376 that drew 8025-6 sword. 2719

21:6 But Levi 3878 and Benjamin 1144 counted 6485-1 he not among 8432 them: for the king's 4428 word 1697 was abominable 8581-8 to Joab. 3097

21:7 And God 430 was displeased 3415-4 5869 with this thing; 1697 therefore he smote 5221-55 Israel. 3478

21:8 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto God, 430 I have sinned 2398-1 greatly, 3966 because I have done 6213-1 this thing: 1697 but now, I beseech thee, do away 5674-54 the iniquity 5771 of thy servant; 5650 for I have done very 3966 foolishly. 5528-8

21:9 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Gad, 1410 David's 1732 seer, 2374 saying, 559-2

21:10 Go 3212-3 and tell 1696-14 David, 1732 saying, 559-2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 I offer 5186-6 thee three 7969 [things]: choose 977-3 thee one 259 of them, 2007 that I may do 6213-4 [it] unto thee.

21:11 So Gad 1410 came 935-4 to David, 1732 and said 559-4 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Choose 6901-16 thee

21:12 Either 518 three 7969 years' 8141 famine; 7458 or three 7969 months 2320 to be destroyed 5595-12 before 6440 thy foes, 6862 while that the sword 2719 of thine enemies 341-6 overtaketh 5381-56 [thee]; or else three 7969 days 3117 the sword 2719 of the LORD, 3068 even the pestilence, 1698 in the land, 776 and the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 destroying 7843-56 throughout all the coasts 1366 of Israel. 3478 Now therefore advise 7200-3 thyself what word 1697 I shall bring again 7725-55 to him that sent 7971-6 me.

21:13 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto Gad, 1410 I am in a great 3966 strait: 6887-1 let me fall 5307-4 now into the hand 3027 of the LORD; 3068 for very 3966 great 7227 [are] his mercies: 7356 but let me not fall 5307-4 into the hand 3027 of man. 120

21:14 So the LORD 3068 sent 5414-4 pestilence 1698 upon Israel: 3478 and there fell 5307-4 of Israel 3478 seventy 7657 thousand 505 men. 376

21:15 And God 430 sent 7971-4 an angel 4397 unto Jerusalem 3389 to destroy 7843-53 it: and as he was destroying, 7843-53 the LORD 3068 beheld, 7200-1 and he repented 5162-11 him of the evil, 7451 and said 559-4 to the angel 4397 that destroyed, 7843-56 It is enough, 7227 stay 7503-54 now thine hand. 3027 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 stood 5975-6 by the threshingfloor 1637 of Ornan 771 the Jebusite. 2983

21:16 And David 1732 lifted up 5375-4 his eyes, 5869 and saw 7200-4 the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 stand 5975-6 between the earth 776 and the heaven, 8064 having a drawn 8025-7 sword 2719 in his hand 3027 stretched out 5186-7 over Jerusalem. 3389 Then David 1732 and the elders 2205 [of Israel, who were] clothed 3680-30 in sackcloth, 8242 fell 5307-4 upon their faces. 6440

21:17 And David 1732 said 559-4 unto God, 430 [Is it] not I [that] commanded 559-1 the people 5971 to be numbered? 4487-2 even I it is that have sinned 2398-1 and done evil 7489-52 indeed; 7489-53 but [as for] these sheep, 6629 what have they done? 6213-1 let thine hand, 3027 I pray thee, O LORD 3068 my God, 430 be on me, and on my father's 1 house; 1004 but not on thy people, 5971 that they should be plagued. 4046

21:18 Then the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 commanded 559-1 Gad 1410 to say 559-2 to David, 1732 that David 1732 should go up, 5927-4 and set up 6965-53 an altar 4196 unto the LORD 3068 in the threshingfloor 1637 of Ornan 771 the Jebusite. 2983

21:19 And David 1732 went up 5927-4 at the saying 1697 of Gad, 1410 which he spake 1696-14 in the name 8034 of the LORD. 3068

21:20 And Ornan 771 turned back, 7725-4 and saw 7200-4 the angel; 4397 and his four 702 sons 1121 with him hid 2244-102 themselves. Now Ornan 771 was threshing 1758-1 wheat. 2406

21:21 And as David 1732 came 935-4 to Ornan, 771 Ornan 771 looked 5027-55 and saw 7200-4 David, 1732 and went out 3318-4 of the threshingfloor, 1637 and bowed 7812-101 himself to David 1732 with [his] face 639 to the ground. 776

21:22 Then David 1732 said 559-4 to Ornan, 771 Grant 5414-3 me the place 4725 of [this] threshingfloor, 1637 that I may build 1129-4 an altar 4196 therein unto the LORD: 3068 thou shalt grant 5414-3 it me for the full 4392 price: 3701 that the plague 4046 may be stayed 6113-11 from the people. 5971

21:23 And Ornan 771 said 559-4 unto David, 1732 Take 3947-3 [it] to thee, and let my lord 113 the king 4428 do 6213-4 [that which is] good 2896 in his eyes: 5869 lo, 7200-3 I give 5414-1 [thee] the oxen 1241 [also] for burnt offerings, 5930 and the threshing instruments 4173 for wood, 6086 and the wheat 2406 for the meat offering; 4503 I give 5414-1 it all.

21:24 And king 4428 David 1732 said 559-4 to Ornan, 771 Nay; but I will verily 7069-2 buy 7069-4 it for the full 4392 price: 3701 for I will not take 5375-4 [that] which [is] thine for the LORD, 3068 nor offer 5927-53 burnt offerings 5930 without cost. 2600

21:25 So David 1732 gave 5414-4 to Ornan 771 for the place 4725 six 8337 hundred 3967 shekels 8255 of gold 2091 by weight. 4948

21:26 And David 1732 built 1129-4 there an altar 4196 unto the LORD, 3068 and offered 5927-55 burnt offerings 5930 and peace offerings, 8002 and called 7121-4 upon the LORD; 3068 and he answered 6030-4 him from heaven 8064 by fire 784 upon the altar 4196 of burnt offering. 5930

21:27 And the LORD 3068 commanded 559-4 the angel; 4397 and he put up his sword 2719 again 7725-55 into the sheath 5084 thereof.

21:28 At that time 6256 when David 1732 saw 7200-2 that the LORD 3068 had answered 6030-1 him in the threshingfloor 1637 of Ornan 771 the Jebusite, 2983 then he sacrificed 2076-4 there.

21:29 For the tabernacle 4908 of the LORD, 3068 which Moses 4872 made 6213-1 in the wilderness, 4057 and the altar 4196 of the burnt offering, 5930 [were] at that season 6256 in the high place 1116 at Gibeon. 1391

21:30 But David 1732 could 3201-1 not go 3212-2 before 6440 it to enquire 1875-2 of God: 430 for he was afraid 1204-8 because 6440 of the sword 2719 of the angel 4397 of the LORD. 3068

22:1 Then David 1732 said, 559-4 This [is] the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 God, 430 and this [is] the altar 4196 of the burnt offering 5930 for Israel. 3478

22:2 And David 1732 commanded 559-4 to gather together 3664-2 the strangers 1616 that [were] in the land 776 of Israel; 3478 and he set 5975-55 masons 2672-6 to hew 2672-2 wrought 1496 stones 68 to build 1129-2 the house 1004 of God. 430

22:3 And David 1732 prepared 3559-52 iron 1270 in abundance 7230 for the nails 4548 for the doors 1817 of the gates, 8179 and for the joinings; 4226 and brass 5178 in abundance 7230 without weight; 4948

22:4 Also cedar 730 trees 6086 in abundance: 369 4557 for the Zidonians 6722 and they of Tyre 6876 brought 935-52 much 7230 cedar 730 wood 6086 to David. 1732

22:5 And David 1732 said, 559-4 Solomon 8010 my son 1121 [is] young 5288 and tender, 7390 and the house 1004 [that is] to be builded 1129-2 for the LORD 3068 [must be] exceeding 4605 magnifical, 1431-53 of fame 8034 and of glory 8597 throughout all countries: 776 I will [therefore] now make preparation 3559-55 for it. So David 1732 prepared 3559-55 abundantly 7230 before 6440 his death. 4194

22:6 Then he called 7121-4 for Solomon 8010 his son, 1121 and charged 6680-17 him to build 1129-2 an house 1004 for the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel. 3478

22:7 And David 1732 said 559-4 to Solomon, 8010 My son, 1121 as for me, it was in my mind 3824 to build 1129-2 an house 1004 unto the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 my God: 430

22:8 But the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came to me, saying, 559-2 Thou hast shed 8210-1 blood 1818 abundantly, 7230 and hast made 6213-1 great 1419 wars: 4421 thou shalt not build 1129-4 an house 1004 unto my name, 8034 because thou hast shed 8210-1 much 7227 blood 1818 upon the earth 776 in my sight. 6440

22:9 Behold, a son 1121 shall be born 3205-12 to thee, who shall be a man 376 of rest; 4496 and I will give him rest 5117-52 from all his enemies 341-6 round about: 5439 for his name 8034 shall be Solomon, 8010 and I will give 5414-4 peace 7965 and quietness 8253 unto Israel 3478 in his days. 3117

22:10 He shall build 1129-4 an house 1004 for my name; 8034 and he shall be my son, 1121 and I [will be] his father; 1 and I will establish 3559-52 the throne 3678 of his kingdom 4438 over Israel 3478 for 5704 ever. 5769

22:11 Now, my son, 1121 the LORD 3068 be with thee; and prosper 6743-52 thou, and build 1129-1 the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 as he hath said 1696-14 of thee.

22:12 Only the LORD 3068 give 5414-4 thee wisdom 7922 and understanding, 998 and give thee charge 6680-17 concerning Israel, 3478 that thou mayest keep 8104-2 the law 8451 of the LORD 3068 thy God. 430

22:13 Then shalt thou prosper, 6743-55 if thou takest heed 8104-4 to fulfil 6213-2 the statutes 2706 and judgments 4941 which the LORD 3068 charged 6680-14 Moses 4872 with concerning Israel: 3478 be strong, 2388-3 and of good courage; 553-3 dread 3372-4 not, nor be dismayed. 2865-11

22:14 Now, behold, in my trouble 6040 I have prepared 3559-52 for the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 an hundred 3967 thousand 505 talents 3603 of gold, 2091 and a thousand 505 thousand 505 talents 3603 of silver; 3701 and of brass 5178 and iron 1270 without weight; 4948 for it is in abundance: 7230 timber 6086 also and stone 68 have I prepared; 3559-52 and thou mayest add 3254-55 thereto.

22:15 Moreover [there are] workmen 6213-6 4399 with thee in abundance, 7230 hewers 2672-6 and workers 2796 of stone 68 and timber, 6086 and all manner of cunning men 2450 for every manner of work. 4399

22:16 Of the gold, 2091 the silver, 3701 and the brass, 5178 and the iron, 1270 [there is] no number. 4557 Arise 6965-3 [therefore], and be doing, 6213-3 and the LORD 3068 be with thee.

22:17 David 1732 also commanded 6680-17 all the princes 8269 of Israel 3478 to help 5826-2 Solomon 8010 his son, 1121 [saying],

22:18 [Is] not the LORD 3068 your God 430 with you? and hath he [not] given you rest 5117-52 on every side? 5439 for he hath given 5414-1 the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land 776 into mine hand; 3027 and the land 776 is subdued 3533-8 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and before 6440 his people. 5971

22:19 Now set 5414-3 your heart 3824 and your soul 5315 to seek 1875-2 the LORD 3068 your God; 430 arise 6965-3 therefore, and build 1129-3 ye the sanctuary 4720 of the LORD 3068 God, 430 to bring 935-53 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD, 3068 and the holy 6944 vessels 3627 of God, 430 into the house 1004 that is to be built 1129-12 to the name 8034 of the LORD. 3068

23:1 So when David 1732 was old 2204-1 and full 7646-1 of days, 3117 he made Solomon 8010 his son 1121 king 4427-55 over Israel. 3478

23:2 And he gathered 622-4 together all the princes 8269 of Israel, 3478 with the priests 3548 and the Levites. 3881

23:3 Now the Levites 3881 were numbered 5608-11 from the age 1121 of thirty 7970 years 8141 and upward: 4605 and their number 4557 by their polls, 1538 man 1397 by man, 1397 was thirty 7970 and eight 8083 thousand. 505

23:4 Of which, 428 twenty 6242 and four 702 thousand 505 [were] to set forward 5329-15 the work 4399 of the house 1004 of the LORD; 3068 and six 8337 thousand 505 [were] officers 7860-6 and judges: 8199-6

23:5 Moreover four 702 thousand 505 [were] porters; 7778 and four 702 thousand 505 praised 1984-18 the LORD 3068 with the instruments 3627 which I made, 6213-1 [said David], to praise 1984-15 [therewith].

23:6 And David 1732 divided 2505-11 them into courses 4256 among the sons 1121 of Levi, 3878 [namely], Gershon, 1648 Kohath, 6955 and Merari. 4847

23:7 Of the Gershonites 1649 [were], Laadan, 3936 and Shimei. 8096

23:8 The sons 1121 of Laadan; 3936 the chief 7218 [was] Jehiel, 3171 and Zetham, 2241 and Joel, 3100 three. 7969

23:9 The sons 1121 of Shimei; 8096 Shelomith, 8019|8013-k and Haziel, 2381 and Haran, 2039 three. 7969 These [were] the chief 7218 of the fathers 1 of Laadan. 3936

23:10 And the sons 1121 of Shimei 8096 [were], Jahath, 3189 Zina, 2126 and Jeush, 3266 and Beriah. 1283 These four 702 [were] the sons 1121 of Shimei. 8096

23:11 And Jahath 3189 was the chief, 7218 and Zizah 2125 the second: 8145 but Jeush 3266 and Beriah 1283 had not many 7235-52 sons; 1121 therefore they were in one 259 reckoning, 6486 according to [their] father's 1 house. 1004

23:12 The sons 1121 of Kohath; 6955 Amram, 6019 Izhar, 3324 Hebron, 2275 and Uzziel, 5816 four. 702

23:13 The sons 1121 of Amram; 6019 Aaron 175 and Moses: 4872 and Aaron 175 was separated, 914-11 that he should sanctify 6942-53 the most 6944 holy things, 6944 he and his sons 1121 for 5704 ever, 5769 to burn incense 6999-53 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 to minister 8334-15 unto him, and to bless 1288-15 in his name 8034 for 5704 ever. 5769

23:14 Now [concerning] Moses 4872 the man 376 of God, 430 his sons 1121 were named 7121-11 of the tribe 7626 of Levi. 3878

23:15 The sons 1121 of Moses 4872 [were], Gershom, 1647 and Eliezer. 461

23:16 Of the sons 1121 of Gershom, 1647 Shebuel 7619 [was] the chief. 7218

23:17 And the sons 1121 of Eliezer 461 [were], Rehabiah 7345 the chief. 7218 And Eliezer 461 had none other 312 sons; 1121 but the sons 1121 of Rehabiah 7345 were very 4605 many. 7235-1

23:18 Of the sons 1121 of Izhar; 3324 Shelomith 8019 the chief. 7218

23:19 Of the sons 1121 of Hebron; 2275 Jeriah 3404 the first, 7218 Amariah 568 the second, 8145 Jahaziel 3166 the third, 7992 and Jekameam 3360 the fourth. 7243

23:20 Of the sons 1121 of Uzziel; 5816 Michah 4318 the first, 7218 and Jesiah 3449 the second. 8145

23:21 The sons 1121 of Merari; 4847 Mahli, 4249 and Mushi. 4187 The sons 1121 of Mahli; 4249 Eleazar, 499 and Kish. 7027

23:22 And Eleazar 499 died, 4191-4 and had no sons, 1121 but daughters: 1323 and their brethren 251 the sons 1121 of Kish 7027 took 5375-4 them.

23:23 The sons 1121 of Mushi; 4187 Mahli, 4249 and Eder, 5740 and Jeremoth, 3406 three. 7969

23:24 These [were] the sons 1121 of Levi 3878 after the house 1004 of their fathers; 1 [even] the chief 7218 of the fathers, 1 as they were counted 6485-7 by number 4557 of names 8034 by their polls, 1538 that did 6213-6 the work 4399 for the service 5656 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 from the age 1121 of twenty 6242 years 8141 and upward. 4605

23:25 For David 1732 said, 559-1 The LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 hath given rest 5117-52 unto his people, 5971 that they may dwell 7931-4 in Jerusalem 3389 for ever: 5769

23:26 And also unto the Levites; 3881 they shall no [more] carry 5375-2 the tabernacle, 4908 nor any vessels 3627 of it for the service 5656 thereof.

23:27 For by the last 314 words 1697 of David 1732 the Levites 1121 3881 [were] numbered 4557 from twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 and above: 4605

23:28 Because their office 4612 [was] to wait on 3027 the sons 1121 of Aaron 175 for the service 5656 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 in the courts, 2691 and in the chambers, 3957 and in the purifying 2893 of all holy things, 6944 and the work 4639 of the service 5656 of the house 1004 of God; 430

23:29 Both for the shewbread, 3899 4635 and for the fine flour 5560 for meat offering, 4503 and for the unleavened 4682 cakes, 7550 and for [that which is baked in] the pan, 4227 and for that which is fried, 7246-94 and for all manner of measure 4884 and size; 4060

23:30 And to stand 5975-2 every morning 1242 1242 to thank 3034-53 and praise 1984-15 the LORD, 3068 and likewise at even; 6153

23:31 And to offer 5927-53 all burnt sacrifices 5930 unto the LORD 3068 in the sabbaths, 7676 in the new moons, 2320 and on the set feasts, 4150 by number, 4557 according to the order 4941 commanded unto them, continually 8548 before 6440 the LORD: 3068

23:32 And that they should keep 8104-1 the charge 4931 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and the charge 4931 of the holy 6944 [place], and the charge 4931 of the sons 1121 of Aaron 175 their brethren, 251 in the service 5656 of the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

24:1 Now [these are] the divisions 4256 of the sons 1121 of Aaron. 175 The sons 1121 of Aaron; 175 Nadab, 5070 and Abihu, 30 Eleazar, 499 and Ithamar. 385

24:2 But Nadab 5070 and Abihu 30 died 4191-4 before 6440 their father, 1 and had no children: 1121 therefore Eleazar 499 and Ithamar 385 executed the priest's office. 3547-17

24:3 And David 1732 distributed 2505-11 them, both Zadok 6659 of the sons 1121 of Eleazar, 499 and Ahimelech 288 of the sons 1121 of Ithamar, 385 according to their offices 6486 in their service. 5656

24:4 And there were more 7227 chief 7218 men 1397 found 4672-11 of the sons 1121 of Eleazar 499 than of the sons 1121 of Ithamar; 385 and [thus] were they divided. 2505-4 Among the sons 1121 of Eleazar 499 [there were] sixteen 8337 6240 chief 7218 men of the house 1004 of [their] fathers, 1 and eight 8083 among the sons 1121 of Ithamar 385 according to the house 1004 of their fathers. 1

28:2 Then David 1732 the king 4428 stood up 6965-4 upon his feet, 7272 and said, 559-4 Hear 8085-3 me, my brethren, 251 and my people: 5971 [As for me], I [had] in mine heart 3824 to build 1129-2 an house 1004 of rest 4496 for the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD, 3068 and for the footstool 1916 7272 of our God, 430 and had made ready 3559-52 for the building: 1129-2

28:3 But God 430 said 559-1 unto me, Thou shalt not build 1129-4 an house 1004 for my name, 8034 because thou [hast been] a man 376 of war, 4421 and hast shed 8210-1 blood. 1818

28:4 Howbeit the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 chose 977-4 me before all the house 1004 of my father 1 to be king 4428 over Israel 3478 for ever: 5769 for he hath chosen 977-1 Judah 3063 [to be] the ruler; 5057 and of the house 1004 of Judah, 3063 the house 1004 of my father; 1 and among the sons 1121 of my father 1 he liked 7521-1 me to make [me] king 4427-53 over all Israel: 3478

28:5 And of all my sons, 1121 (for the LORD 3068 hath given 5414-1 me many 7227 sons,) 1121 he hath chosen 977-4 Solomon 8010 my son 1121 to sit 3427-2 upon the throne 3678 of the kingdom 4438 of the LORD 3068 over Israel. 3478

28:6 And he said 559-4 unto me, Solomon 8010 thy son, 1121 he shall build 1129-4 my house 1004 and my courts: 2691 for I have chosen 977-1 him [to be] my son, 1121 and I will be his father. 1

28:7 Moreover I will establish 3559-52 his kingdom 4438 for ever, 5769 if he be constant 2388-4 to do 6213-2 my commandments 4687 and my judgments, 4941 as at this day. 3117

28:8 Now therefore in the sight 5869 of all Israel 3478 the congregation 6951 of the LORD, 3068 and in the audience 241 of our God, 430 keep 8104-3 and seek 1875-3 for all the commandments 4687 of the LORD 3068 your God: 430 that ye may possess 3423-4 this good 2896 land, 776 and leave [it] for an inheritance 5157-52 for your children 1121 after 310 you for 5704 ever. 5769

28:9 And thou, Solomon 8010 my son, 1121 know 3045-3 thou the God 430 of thy father, 1 and serve 5647-3 him with a perfect 8003 heart 3820 and with a willing 2655 mind: 5315 for the LORD 3068 searcheth 1875-6 all hearts, 3824 and understandeth 995-56 all the imaginations 3336 of the thoughts: 4284 if thou seek 1875-4 him, he will be found 4672-11 of thee; but if thou forsake 5800-4 him, he will cast thee off 2186-55 for ever. 5703

28:10 Take heed 7200-3 now; for the LORD 3068 hath chosen 977-1 thee to build 1129-2 an house 1004 for the sanctuary: 4720 be strong, 2388-3 and do 6213-3 [it].

28:11 Then David 1732 gave 5414-4 to Solomon 8010 his son 1121 the pattern 8403 of the porch, 197 and of the houses 1004 thereof, and of the treasuries 1597 thereof, and of the upper chambers 5944 thereof, and of the inner 6442 parlours 2315 thereof, and of the place 1004 of the mercy seat, 3727

28:12 And the pattern 8403 of all that he had by the spirit, 7307 of the courts 2691 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and of all the chambers 3957 round about, 5439 of the treasuries 214 of the house 1004 of God, 430 and of the treasuries 214 of the dedicated things: 6944

28:19 All [this, said David], the LORD 3068 made me understand 7919-52 in writing 3791 by [his] hand 3027 upon me, [even] all the works 4399 of this pattern. 8403

28:20 And David 1732 said 559-4 to Solomon 8010 his son, 1121 Be strong 2388-3 and of good courage, 553-3 and do 6213-3 [it]: fear 3372-4 not, nor be dismayed: 2865-11 for the LORD 3068 God, 430 [even] my God, 430 [will be] with thee; he will not fail 7503-55 thee, nor forsake 5800-4 thee, until thou hast finished 3615-2 all the work 4399 for the service 5656 of the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

28:21 And, behold, the courses 4256 of the priests 3548 and the Levites, 3881 [even they shall be with thee] for all the service 5656 of the house 1004 of God: 430 and [there shall be] with thee for all manner of workmanship 4399 every willing 5081 skilful 2451 man, for any manner of service: 5656 also the princes 8269 and all the people 5971 [will be] wholly at thy commandment. 1697

29:1 Furthermore David 1732 the king 4428 said 559-4 unto all the congregation, 6951 Solomon 8010 my son, 1121 whom alone 259 God 430 hath chosen, 977-1 [is yet] young 5288 and tender, 7390 and the work 4399 [is] great: 1419 for the palace 1002 [is] not for man, 120 but for the LORD 3068 God. 430

29:2 Now I have prepared 3559-52 with all my might 3581 for the house 1004 of my God 430 the gold 2091 for [things to be made] of gold, 2091 and the silver 3701 for [things] of silver, 3701 and the brass 5178 for [things] of brass, 5178 the iron 1270 for [things] of iron, 1270 and wood 6086 for [things] of wood; 6086 onyx 7718 stones, 68 and [stones] to be set, 4394 glistering 6320 stones, 68 and of divers colours, 7553 and all manner of precious 3368 stones, 68 and marble 7893 stones 68 in abundance. 7230

29:3 Moreover, because I have set my affection 7521-2 to the house 1004 of my God, 430 I have 3426 of mine own proper good, 5459 of gold 2091 and silver, 3701 [which] I have given 5414-1 to the house 1004 of my God, 430 over 4605 and above all that I have prepared 3559-52 for the holy 6944 house, 1004

29:4 [Even] three 7969 thousand 505 talents 3603 of gold, 2091 of the gold 2091 of Ophir, 211 and seven 7651 thousand 505 talents 3603 of refined 2212-30 silver, 3701 to overlay 2902-2 the walls 7023 of the houses 1004 [withal]:

29:5 The gold 2091 for [things] of gold, 2091 and the silver 3701 for [things] of silver, 3701 and for all manner of work 4399 [to be made] by the hands 3027 of artificers. 2796 And who [then] is willing 5068-102 to consecrate 4390-15 his service 3027 this day 3117 unto the LORD? 3068

29:6 Then the chief 8269 of the fathers 1 and princes 8269 of the tribes 7626 of Israel, 3478 and the captains 8269 of thousands 505 and of hundreds, 3967 with the rulers 8269 of the king's 4428 work, 4399 offered willingly, 5068-101

29:8 And they with whom [precious] stones 68 were found 4672-12 gave 5414-1 [them] to the treasure 214 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 by the hand 3027 of Jehiel 3171 the Gershonite. 1649

29:9 Then the people 5971 rejoiced, 8055-4 for that they offered willingly, 5068-99 because with perfect 8003 heart 3820 they offered willingly 5068-98 to the LORD: 3068 and David 1732 the king 4428 also rejoiced 8055-1 with great 1419 joy. 8057

29:10 Wherefore David 1732 blessed 1288-17 the LORD 3068 before 5869 all the congregation: 6951 and David 1732 said, 559-4 Blessed 1288-7 [be] thou, LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 our father, 1 for 5704 ever 5769 and ever. 5769

29:11 Thine, O LORD, 3068 [is] the greatness, 1420 and the power, 1369 and the glory, 8597 and the victory, 5331 and the majesty: 1935 for all [that is] in the heaven 8064 and in the earth 776 [is thine]; thine [is] the kingdom, 4467 O LORD, 3068 and thou art exalted 4984-102|5375-102 as head 7218 above all.

29:12 Both riches 6239 and honour 3519 [come] of thee, 6440 and thou reignest 4910-6 over all; and in thine hand 3027 [is] power 3581 and might; 1369 and in thine hand 3027 [it is] to make great, 1431-15 and to give strength 2388-15 unto all.

29:13 Now therefore, our God, 430 we thank 3034-56 thee, and praise 1984-18 thy glorious 8597 name. 8034

29:14 But who [am] I, and what [is] my people, 5971 that we should be 6113-4 able 3581 to offer so willingly 5068-99 after this sort? for all things [come] of thee, and of thine own 3027 have we given 5414-1 thee.

29:15 For we [are] strangers 1616 before 6440 thee, and sojourners, 8453 as [were] all our fathers: 1 our days 3117 on the earth 776 [are] as a shadow, 6738 and [there is] none abiding. 4723

29:16 O LORD 3068 our God, 430 all this store 1995 that we have prepared 3559-52 to build 1129-2 thee an house 1004 for thine holy 6944 name 8034 [cometh] of thine hand, 3027 and [is] all thine own.

29:17 I know 3045-1 also, my God, 430 that thou triest 974-6 the heart, 3824 and hast pleasure 7521-4 in uprightness. 4339 As for me, in the uprightness 3476 of mine heart 3824 I have willingly offered 5068-98 all these things: and now have I seen 7200-1 with joy 8057 thy people, 5971 which are present 4672-8 here, to offer willingly 5068-99 unto thee.

29:18 O LORD 3068 God 430 of Abraham, 85 Isaac, 3327 and of Israel, 3478 our fathers, 1 keep 8104-3 this for ever 5769 in the imagination 3336 of the thoughts 4284 of the heart 3824 of thy people, 5971 and prepare 3559-54 their heart 3824 unto thee:

29:19 And give 5414-3 unto Solomon 8010 my son 1121 a perfect 8003 heart, 3824 to keep 8104-2 thy commandments, 4687 thy testimonies, 5715 and thy statutes, 2706 and to do 6213-2 all [these things], and to build 1129-2 the palace, 1002 [for] the which I have made provision. 3559-52

29:20 And David 1732 said 559-4 to all the congregation, 6951 Now bless 1288-16 the LORD 3068 your God. 430 And all the congregation 6951 blessed 1288-17 the LORD 3068 God 430 of their fathers, 1 and bowed down their heads, 6915-4 and worshipped 7812-101 the LORD, 3068 and the king. 4428

29:21 And they sacrificed 2076-4 sacrifices 2077 unto the LORD, 3068 and offered 5927-55 burnt offerings 5930 unto the LORD, 3068 on the morrow 4283 after that day, 3117 [even] a thousand 505 bullocks, 6499 a thousand 505 rams, 352 [and] a thousand 505 lambs, 3532 with their drink offerings, 5262 and sacrifices 2077 in abundance 7230 for all Israel: 3478

29:22 And did eat 398-4 and drink 8354-4 before 6440 the LORD 3068 on that day 3117 with great 1419 gladness. 8057 And they made Solomon 8010 the son 1121 of David 1732 king 4427-55 the second time, 8145 and anointed 4886-4 [him] unto the LORD 3068 [to be] the chief governor, 5057 and Zadok 6659 [to be] priest. 3548

29:23 Then Solomon 8010 sat 3427-4 on the throne 3678 of the LORD 3068 as king 4428 instead of David 1732 his father, 1 and prospered; 6743-55 and all Israel 3478 obeyed 8085-4 him.

29:24 And all the princes, 8269 and the mighty men, 1368 and all the sons 1121 likewise of king 4428 David, 1732 submitted 5414-1 themselves 3027 unto 8478 Solomon 8010 the king. 4428

29:25 And the LORD 3068 magnified 1431-17 Solomon 8010 exceedingly 4605 in the sight 5869 of all Israel, 3478 and bestowed 5414-4 upon him [such] royal 4438 majesty 1935 as had not been on any king 4428 before 6440 him in Israel. 3478

29:26 Thus David 1732 the son 1121 of Jesse 3448 reigned 4427-1 over all Israel. 3478

29:27 And the time 3117 that he reigned 4427-1 over Israel 3478 [was] forty 705 years; 8141 seven 7651 years 8141 reigned 4427-1 he in Hebron, 2275 and thirty 7970 and three 7969 [years] reigned 4427-1 he in Jerusalem. 3389

29:28 And he died 4191-4 in a good 2896 old age, 7872 full 7649 of days, 3117 riches, 6239 and honour: 3519 and Solomon 8010 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

29:29 Now the acts 1697 of David 1732 the king, 4428 first 7223 and last, 314 behold, they [are] written 3789-7 in the book 1697 of Samuel 8050 the seer, 7200-6 and in the book 1697 of Nathan 5416 the prophet, 5030 and in the book 1697 of Gad 1410 the seer, 2374

29:30 With all his reign 4438 and his might, 1369 and the times 6256 that went over 5674-1 him, and over Israel, 3478 and over all the kingdoms 4467 of the countries. 776
