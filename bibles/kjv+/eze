1:1 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth 7970 year, 8141 in the fourth 7243 [month], in the fifth 2568 [day] of the month, 2320 as I [was] among 8432 the captives 1473 by the river 5104 of Chebar, 3529 [that] the heavens 8064 were opened, 6605-8 and I saw 7200-4 visions 4759 of God. 430

1:2 In the fifth 2568 [day] of the month, 2320 which [was] the fifth 2549 year 8141 of king 4428 Jehoiachin's 3112 captivity, 1546

1:3 The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came expressly unto Ezekiel 3168 the priest, 3548 the son 1121 of Buzi, 941 in the land 776 of the Chaldeans 3778 by the river 5104 Chebar; 3529 and the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 was there upon him.

1:4 And I looked, 7200-4 and, behold, a whirlwind 7307 5591 came 935-6 out of the north, 6828 a great 1419 cloud, 6051 and a fire 784 infolding 3947-102 itself, and a brightness 5051 [was] about 5439 it, and out of the midst 8432 thereof as the colour 5869 of amber, 2830 out of the midst 8432 of the fire. 784

1:5 Also out of the midst 8432 thereof [came] the likeness 1823 of four 702 living creatures. 2416 And this [was] their appearance; 4758 they had 2007 the likeness 1823 of a man. 120

1:6 And every one 259 had four 702 faces, 6440 and every one 259 had four 702 wings. 3671

1:7 And their feet 7272 [were] straight 3477 feet; 7272 and the sole 3709 of their feet 7272 [was] like the sole 3709 of a calf's 5695 foot: 7272 and they sparkled 5340-6 like the colour 5869 of burnished 7044 brass. 5178

1:8 And [they had] the hands 3027 of a man 120 under their wings 3671 on their four 702 sides; 7253 and they four 702 had their faces 6440 and their wings. 3671

1:9 Their wings 3671 [were] joined 2266-6 one 802 to another; 269 they turned 5437-11 not when they went; 3212-2 they went 3212-4 every one 376 straight 5676 forward. 6440

1:10 As for the likeness 1823 of their faces, 6440 they four 702 had the face 6440 of a man, 120 and the face 6440 of a lion, 738 on the right side: 3225 and they four 702 had the face 6440 of an ox 7794 on the left side; 8040 they four 702 also had the face 6440 of an eagle. 5404

1:11 Thus [were] their faces: 6440 and their wings 3671 [were] stretched 6504-7 upward; 4605 two 8147 [wings] of every one 376 [were] joined 2266-6 one 376 to another, 376 and two 8147 covered 3680-18 their bodies. 1472

1:12 And they went 3212-4 every one 376 straight 5676 forward: 6440 whither the spirit 7307 was to go, 3212-2 they went; 3212-4 [and] they turned 5437-11 not when they went. 3212-2

1:13 As for the likeness 1823 of the living creatures, 2416 their appearance 4758 [was] like burning 1197-6 coals 1513 of fire, 784 [and] like the appearance 4758 of lamps: 3940 it went up and down 1980-102 among the living creatures; 2416 and the fire 784 was bright, 5051 and out of the fire 784 went forth 3318-6 lightning. 1300

1:14 And the living creatures 2416 ran 7519-2 and returned 7725-2 as the appearance 4758 of a flash of lightning. 965

1:15 Now as I beheld 7200-4 the living creatures, 2416 behold one 259 wheel 212 upon the earth 776 by 681 the living creatures, 2416 with his four 702 faces. 6440

1:16 The appearance 4758 of the wheels 212 and their work 4639 [was] like unto the colour 5869 of a beryl: 8658 and they four 702 had one 259 likeness: 1823 and their appearance 4758 and their work 4639 [was] as it were a wheel 212 in the middle 8432 of a wheel. 212

1:17 When they went, 3212-2 they went 3212-4 upon their four 702 sides: 7253 [and] they turned 5437-11 not when they went. 3212-2

1:18 As for their rings, 1354 they were so high 1363 that they were dreadful; 3374 and their rings 1354 [were] full 4392 of eyes 5869 round about 5439 them four. 702

1:19 And when the living creatures 2416 went, 3212-2 the wheels 212 went 3212-4 by them: 681 and when the living creatures 2416 were lifted up 5375-9 from the earth, 776 the wheels 212 were lifted up. 5375-11

1:20 Whithersoever the spirit 7307 was to go, 3212-2 they went, 3212-4 thither [was their] spirit 7307 to go; 3212-2 and the wheels 212 were lifted up 5375-11 over against 5980 them: for the spirit 7307 of the living creature 2416 [was] in the wheels. 212

1:21 When those went, 3212-2 [these] went; 3212-4 and when those stood, 5975-2 [these] stood; 5975-4 and when those were lifted up 5375-9 from the earth, 776 the wheels 212 were lifted up 5375-11 over against 5980 them: for the spirit 7307 of the living creature 2416 [was] in the wheels. 212

1:22 And the likeness 1823 of the firmament 7549 upon the heads 7218 of the living creature 2416 [was] as the colour 5869 of the terrible 3372-12 crystal, 7140 stretched forth 5186-7 over their heads 7218 above. 4605

1:23 And under the firmament 7549 [were] their wings 3671 straight, 3477 the one 802 toward the other: 269 every one 376 had two, 8147 which covered 3680-18 on this side, 2007 and every one 376 had two, 8147 which covered 3680-18 on that side, 2007 their bodies. 1472

1:24 And when they went, 3212-2 I heard 8085-4 the noise 6963 of their wings, 3671 like the noise 6963 of great 7227 waters, 4325 as the voice 6963 of the Almighty, 7706 the voice 6963 of speech, 1999 as the noise 6963 of an host: 4264 when they stood, 5975-2 they let down 7503-17 their wings. 3671

1:25 And there was a voice 6963 from the firmament 7549 that [was] over their heads, 7218 when they stood, 5975-2 [and] had let down 7503-17 their wings. 3671

1:26 And above 4605 the firmament 7549 that [was] over their heads 7218 [was] the likeness 1823 of a throne, 3678 as the appearance 4758 of a sapphire 5601 stone: 68 and upon the likeness 1823 of the throne 3678 [was] the likeness 1823 as the appearance 4758 of a man 120 above 4605 upon it.

1:27 And I saw 7200-4 as the colour 5869 of amber, 2830 as the appearance 4758 of fire 784 round about 5439 within 1004 it, from the appearance 4758 of his loins 4975 even upward, 4605 and from the appearance 4758 of his loins 4975 even downward, 4295 I saw 7200-1 as it were the appearance 4758 of fire, 784 and it had brightness 5051 round about. 5439

1:28 As the appearance 4758 of the bow 7198 that is in the cloud 6051 in the day 3117 of rain, 1653 so [was] the appearance 4758 of the brightness 5051 round about. 5439 This [was] the appearance 4758 of the likeness 1823 of the glory 3519 of the LORD. 3068 And when I saw 7200-4 [it], I fell 5307-4 upon my face, 6440 and I heard 8085-4 a voice 6963 of one that spake. 1696-18

2:1 And he said 559-4 unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 stand 5975-3 upon thy feet, 7272 and I will speak 1696-17 unto thee.

2:2 And the spirit 7307 entered 935-4 into me when he spake 1696-14 unto me, and set 5975-55 me upon my feet, 7272 that I heard 8085-4 him that spake 1696-102 unto me.

2:3 And he said 559-4 unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 I send 7971-6 thee to the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 to a rebellious 4775-6 nation 1471 that hath rebelled 4775-1 against me: they and their fathers 1 have transgressed 6586-1 against me, [even] unto this very 6106 day. 3117

2:4 For [they are] impudent 7186 6440 children 1121 and stiffhearted. 2389 3820 I do send 7971-6 thee unto them; and thou shalt say 559-1 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

2:5 And they, whether they will hear, 8085-4 or whether they will forbear, 2308-4 (for they [are] a rebellious 4805 house,) 1004 yet shall know 3045-1 that there hath been a prophet 5030 among 8432 them.

2:6 And thou, son 1121 of man, 120 be not afraid 3372-4 of them, neither be afraid 3372-4 of their words, 1697 though briers 5621 and thorns 5544 [be] with thee, and thou dost dwell 3427-6 among scorpions: 6137 be not afraid 3372-4 of their words, 1697 nor be dismayed 2865-11 at their looks, 6440 though they [be] a rebellious 4805 house. 1004

2:7 And thou shalt speak 1696-14 my words 1697 unto them, whether they will hear, 8085-4 or whether they will forbear: 2308-4 for they [are] most rebellious. 4805

2:8 But thou, son 1121 of man, 120 hear 8085-3 what I say 1696-18 unto thee; Be 1961-4 not thou rebellious 4805 like that rebellious 4805 house: 1004 open 6475-3 thy mouth, 6310 and eat 398-3 that I give 5414-6 thee.

2:9 And when I looked, 7200-4 behold, an hand 3027 [was] sent 7971-7 unto me; and, lo, a roll 4039 of a book 5612 [was] therein;

2:10 And he spread 6566-4 it before 6440 me; and it [was] written 3789-7 within 6440 and without: 268 and [there was] written 3789-7 therein lamentations, 7015 and mourning, 1899 and woe. 1958

3:1 Moreover he said 559-4 unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 eat 398-3 that thou findest; 4672-4 eat 398-3 this roll, 4039 and go 3212-3 speak 1696-16 unto the house 1004 of Israel. 3478

3:2 So I opened 6605-4 my mouth, 6310 and he caused me to eat 398-55 that roll. 4039

3:3 And he said 559-4 unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 cause thy belly 990 to eat, 398-55 and fill 4390-17 thy bowels 4578 with this roll 4039 that I give 5414-6 thee. Then did I eat 398-4 [it]; and it was in my mouth 6310 as honey 1706 for sweetness. 4966

3:4 And he said 559-4 unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 go, 3212-3 get 935-3 thee unto the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 and speak 1696-14 with my words 1697 unto them.

3:5 For thou [art] not sent 7971-7 to a people 5971 of a strange 6012 speech 8193 and of an hard 3515 language, 3956 [but] to the house 1004 of Israel; 3478

3:6 Not to many 7227 people 5971 of a strange 6012 speech 8193 and of an hard 3515 language, 3956 whose words 1697 thou canst not understand. 8085-4 Surely, had I sent 7971-1 thee to them, they would have hearkened 8085-4 unto thee.

3:7 But the house 1004 of Israel 3478 will 14-4 not hearken 8085-2 unto thee; for they will 14-6 not hearken 8085-2 unto me: for all the house 1004 of Israel 3478 [are] impudent 2389 4696 and hardhearted. 7186 3820

3:8 Behold, I have made 5414-1 thy face 6440 strong 2389 against 5980 their faces, 6440 and thy forehead 4696 strong 2389 against 5980 their foreheads. 4696

3:9 As an adamant 8068 harder 2389 than flint 6864 have I made 5414-1 thy forehead: 4696 fear 3372-4 them not, neither be dismayed 2865-11 at their looks, 6440 though they [be] a rebellious 4805 house. 1004

3:10 Moreover he said 559-4 unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 all my words 1697 that I shall speak 1696-17 unto thee receive 3947-3 in thine heart, 3824 and hear 8085-3 with thine ears. 241

3:11 And go, 3212-3 get 935-3 thee to them of the captivity, 1473 unto the children 1121 of thy people, 5971 and speak 1696-14 unto them, and tell 559-1 them, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 whether they will hear, 8085-4 or whether they will forbear. 2308-4

3:12 Then the spirit 7307 took me up, 5375-4 and I heard 8085-4 behind 310 me a voice 6963 of a great 1419 rushing, 7494 [saying], Blessed 1288-7 [be] the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 from his place. 4725

3:13 [I heard] also the noise 6963 of the wings 3671 of the living creatures 2416 that touched 5401-56 one 802 another, 269 and the noise 6963 of the wheels 212 over against 5980 them, and a noise 6963 of a great 1419 rushing. 7494

3:14 So the spirit 7307 lifted me up, 5375-1 and took me away, 3947-4 and I went 3212-4 in bitterness, 4751 in the heat 2534 of my spirit; 7307 but the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 was strong 2388-1 upon me.

3:15 Then I came 935-4 to them of the captivity 1473 at Telabib, 8512 that dwelt 3427-6 by the river 5104 of Chebar, 3529 and I sat 3427-4 where they sat, 3427-6 and remained 3427-4 there astonished 8074-56 among 8432 them seven 7651 days. 3117

3:16 And it came to pass at the end 7097 of seven 7651 days, 3117 that the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

3:17 Son 1121 of man, 120 I have made 5414-1 thee a watchman 6822-6 unto the house 1004 of Israel: 3478 therefore hear 8085-1 the word 1697 at my mouth, 6310 and give them warning 2094-52 from me.

3:18 When I say 559-2 unto the wicked, 7563 Thou shalt surely 4191-2 die; 4191-4 and thou givest him not warning, 2094-52 nor speakest 1696-14 to warn 2094-53 the wicked 7563 from his wicked 7563 way, 1870 to save his life; 2421-15 the same wicked 7563 [man] shall die 4191-4 in his iniquity; 5771 but his blood 1818 will I require 1245-17 at thine hand. 3027

3:19 Yet if thou warn 2094-52 the wicked, 7563 and he turn 7725-1 not from his wickedness, 7562 nor from his wicked 7563 way, 1870 he shall die 4191-4 in his iniquity; 5771 but thou hast delivered 5337-52 thy soul. 5315

3:20 Again, When a righteous 6662 [man] doth turn 7725-2 from his righteousness, 6664 and commit 6213-1 iniquity, 5766 and I lay 5414-1 a stumblingblock 4383 before 6440 him, he shall die: 4191-4 because thou hast not given him warning, 2094-52 he shall die 4191-4 in his sin, 2403 and his righteousness 6666 which he hath done 6213-1 shall not be remembered; 2142-11 but his blood 1818 will I require 1245-17 at thine hand. 3027

3:21 Nevertheless if thou warn 2094-52 the righteous 6662 [man], that the righteous 6662 sin 2398-2 not, and he doth not sin, 2398-1 he shall surely 2421-2 live, 2421-4 because he is warned; 2094-12 also thou hast delivered 5337-52 thy soul. 5315

3:22 And the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 was there upon me; and he said 559-4 unto me, Arise, 6965-3 go forth 3318-3 into the plain, 1237 and I will there talk 1696-17 with thee.

3:23 Then I arose, 6965-4 and went forth 3318-4 into the plain: 1237 and, behold, the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 stood 5975-6 there, as the glory 3519 which I saw 7200-1 by the river 5104 of Chebar: 3529 and I fell 5307-4 on my face. 6440

3:24 Then the spirit 7307 entered 935-4 into me, and set 5975-55 me upon my feet, 7272 and spake 1696-17 with me, and said 559-4 unto me, Go, 935-3 shut 5462-10 thyself within 8432 thine house. 1004

3:25 But thou, O son 1121 of man, 120 behold, they shall put 5414-1 bands 5688 upon thee, and shall bind 631-1 thee with them, and thou shalt not go out 3318-4 among 8432 them:

3:26 And I will make thy tongue 3956 cleave 1692-55 to the roof of thy mouth, 2441 that thou shalt be dumb, 481-8 and shalt not be to them a reprover: 376 3198-56 for they [are] a rebellious 4805 house. 1004

3:27 But when I speak 1696-15 with thee, 854 I will open 6605-4 thy mouth, 6310 and thou shalt say 559-1 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 He that heareth, 8085-6 let him hear; 8085-4 and he that forbeareth, 2310 let him forbear: 2308-4 for they [are] a rebellious 4805 house. 1004

4:1 Thou also, son 1121 of man, 120 take 3947-3 thee a tile, 3843 and lay 5414-1 it before 6440 thee, and pourtray 2710-1 upon it the city, 5892 [even] Jerusalem: 3389

4:2 And lay 5414-1 siege 4692 against it, and build 1129-1 a fort 1785 against it, and cast 8210-1 a mount 5550 against it; set 5414-1 the camp 4264 also against it, and set 7760-3 [battering] rams 3733 against it round about. 5439

4:3 Moreover take 3947-3 thou unto thee an iron 1270 pan, 4227 and set 5414-1 it [for] a wall 7023 of iron 1270 between thee and the city: 5892 and set 3559-52 thy face 6440 against it, and it shall be besieged, 4692 and thou shalt lay siege 6696-1 against it. This [shall be] a sign 226 to the house 1004 of Israel. 3478

4:4 Lie 7901-3 thou also upon thy left 8042 side, 6654 and lay 7760-1 the iniquity 5771 of the house 1004 of Israel 3478 upon it: [according] to the number 4557 of the days 3117 that thou shalt lie 7901-4 upon it thou shalt bear 5375-4 their iniquity. 5771

4:5 For I have laid 5414-1 upon thee the years 8141 of their iniquity, 5771 according to the number 4557 of the days, 3117 three 7969 hundred 3967 and ninety 8673 days: 3117 so shalt thou bear 5375-1 the iniquity 5771 of the house 1004 of Israel. 3478

4:6 And when thou hast accomplished 3615-14 them, 428 lie 7901-1 again 8145 on thy right 3233|3227-k side, 6654 and thou shalt bear 5375-1 the iniquity 5771 of the house 1004 of Judah 3063 forty 705 days: 3117 I have appointed 5414-1 thee each day 3117 8141 for a year. 3117 8141

4:7 Therefore thou shalt set 3559-55 thy face 6440 toward the siege 4692 of Jerusalem, 3389 and thine arm 2220 [shall be] uncovered, 2834-7 and thou shalt prophesy 5012-8 against it.

4:8 And, behold, I will lay 5414-1 bands 5688 upon thee, and thou shalt not turn 2015-11 thee from one side 6654 to another, 6654 till thou hast ended 3615-15 the days 3117 of thy siege. 4692

4:9 Take 3947-3 thou also unto thee wheat, 2406 and barley, 8184 and beans, 6321 and lentiles, 5742 and millet, 1764 and fitches, 3698 and put 5414-1 them in one 259 vessel, 3627 and make 6213-1 thee bread 3899 thereof, [according] to the number 4557 of the days 3117 that thou shalt lie 7901-6 upon thy side, 6654 three 7969 hundred 3967 and ninety 8673 days 3117 shalt thou eat 398-4 thereof.

4:10 And thy meat 3978 which thou shalt eat 398-4 [shall be] by weight, 4946 twenty 6242 shekels 8255 a day: 3117 from time 6256 to time 6256 shalt thou eat 398-4 it.

4:11 Thou shalt drink 8354-4 also water 4325 by measure, 4884 the sixth part 8345 of an hin: 1969 from time 6256 to time 6256 shalt thou drink. 8354-4

4:12 And thou shalt eat 398-4 it [as] barley 8184 cakes, 5692 and thou shalt bake 5746-4 it with dung 1561 that cometh out 6627 of man, 120 in their sight. 5869

4:13 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 Even thus shall the children 1121 of Israel 3478 eat 398-4 their defiled 2931 bread 3899 among the Gentiles, 1471 whither I will drive 5080-55 them.

4:14 Then said 559-4 I, Ah 162 Lord 136 GOD! 3069 behold, my soul 5315 hath not been polluted: 2930-30 for from my youth 5271 up even till now have I not eaten 398-1 of that which dieth of itself, 5038 or is torn in pieces; 2966 neither came 935-1 there abominable 6292 flesh 1320 into my mouth. 6310

4:15 Then he said 559-4 unto me, Lo, 7200-3 I have given 5414-1 thee cow's 1241 dung 6832|6832-k for man's 120 dung, 1561 and thou shalt prepare 6213-1 thy bread 3899 therewith.

4:16 Moreover he said 559-4 unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 behold, I will break 7665-6 the staff 4294 of bread 3899 in Jerusalem: 3389 and they shall eat 398-1 bread 3899 by weight, 4948 and with care; 1674 and they shall drink 8354-4 water 4325 by measure, 4884 and with astonishment: 8078

4:17 That they may want 2637-4 bread 3899 and water, 4325 and be astonied 8074-8 one 376 with another, 251 and consume away 4743-8 for their iniquity. 5771

5:1 And thou, son 1121 of man, 120 take 3947-3 thee a sharp 2299 knife, 2719 take 3947-4 thee a barber's 1532 razor, 8593 and cause [it] to pass 5674-52 upon thine head 7218 and upon thy beard: 2206 then take 3947-1 thee balances 3976 to weigh, 4948 and divide 2505-14 the [hair].

5:2 Thou shalt burn 1197-55 with fire 217 a third part 7992 in the midst 8432 of the city, 5892 when the days 3117 of the siege 4692 are fulfilled: 4390-2 and thou shalt take 3947-1 a third part, 7992 [and] smite 5221-55 about 5439 it with a knife: 2719 and a third part 7992 thou shalt scatter 2219-4 in the wind; 7307 and I will draw out 7324-55 a sword 2719 after 310 them.

5:3 Thou shalt also take 3947-1 thereof a few 4592 in number, 4557 and bind 6696-1 them in thy skirts. 3671

5:4 Then take 3947-4 of them again, and cast 7993-52 them into the midst 8432 of the fire, 784 and burn 8313-1 them in the fire; 784 [for] thereof shall a fire 784 come forth 3318-4 into all the house 1004 of Israel. 3478

5:5 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 This [is] Jerusalem: 3389 I have set 7760-1 it in the midst 8432 of the nations 1471 and countries 776 [that are] round about 5439 her.

5:6 And she hath changed 4784-55 my judgments 4941 into wickedness 7564 more than the nations, 1471 and my statutes 2708 more than the countries 776 that [are] round about 5439 her: for they have refused 3988-1 my judgments 4941 and my statutes, 2708 they have not walked 1980-1 in them.

5:7 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Because ye multiplied 1995-2 more than the nations 1471 that [are] round about 5439 you, [and] have not walked 1980-1 in my statutes, 2708 neither have kept 6213-1 my judgments, 4941 neither have done 6213-1 according to the judgments 4941 of the nations 1471 that [are] round about 5439 you;

5:8 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I, even I, [am] against thee, and will execute 6213-1 judgments 4941 in the midst 8432 of thee in the sight 5869 of the nations. 1471

5:9 And I will do 6213-1 in thee that which I have not done, 6213-1 and whereunto I will not do 6213-4 any more the like, because 3282 of all thine abominations. 8441

5:10 Therefore the fathers 1 shall eat 398-4 the sons 1121 in the midst 8432 of thee, and the sons 1121 shall eat 398-4 their fathers; 1 and I will execute 6213-1 judgments 8201 in thee, and the whole remnant 7611 of thee will I scatter 2219-14 into all the winds. 7307

5:11 Wherefore, [as] I live, 2416 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Surely, because thou hast defiled 2930-14 my sanctuary 4720 with all thy detestable things, 8251 and with all thine abominations, 8441 therefore will I also diminish 1639-4 [thee]; neither shall mine eye 5869 spare, 2347-4 neither will I have any pity. 2550-4

5:12 A third part 7992 of thee shall die 4191-4 with the pestilence, 1698 and with famine 7458 shall they be consumed 3615-4 in the midst 8432 of thee: and a third part 7992 shall fall 5307-4 by the sword 2719 round about 5439 thee; and I will scatter 2219-17 a third part 7992 into all the winds, 7307 and I will draw out 7324-55 a sword 2719 after 310 them.

5:13 Thus shall mine anger 639 be accomplished, 3615-1 and I will cause my fury 2534 to rest 5117-52 upon them, and I will be comforted: 5162-98 and they shall know 3045-1 that I the LORD 3068 have spoken 1696-14 [it] in my zeal, 7068 when I have accomplished 3615-15 my fury 2534 in them.

5:14 Moreover I will make 5414-4 thee waste, 2723 and a reproach 2781 among the nations 1471 that [are] round about 5439 thee, in the sight 5869 of all that pass by. 5674-6

5:15 So it shall be a reproach 2781 and a taunt, 1422 an instruction 4148 and an astonishment 4923 unto the nations 1471 that [are] round about 5439 thee, when I shall execute 6213-2 judgments 8201 in thee in anger 639 and in fury 2534 and in furious 2534 rebukes. 8433 I the LORD 3068 have spoken 1696-14 [it].

5:16 When I shall send 7971-15 upon them the evil 7451 arrows 2671 of famine, 7458 which shall be for [their] destruction, 4889 [and] which I will send 7971-17 to destroy 7843-15 you: and I will increase 3254-55 the famine 7458 upon you, and will break 7665-1 your staff 4294 of bread: 3899

5:17 So will I send 7971-14 upon you famine 7458 and evil 7451 beasts, 2416 and they shall bereave 7921-14 thee; and pestilence 1698 and blood 1818 shall pass 5674-4 through thee; and I will bring 935-55 the sword 2719 upon thee. I the LORD 3068 have spoken 1696-14 [it].

6:1 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

6:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 set 7760-3 thy face 6440 toward the mountains 2022 of Israel, 3478 and prophesy 5012-10 against them,

6:3 And say, 559-1 Ye mountains 2022 of Israel, 3478 hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD 3069 to the mountains, 2022 and to the hills, 1389 to the rivers, 650 and to the valleys; 1516 Behold, I, [even] I, will bring 935-56 a sword 2719 upon you, and I will destroy 6-14 your high places. 1116

6:4 And your altars 4196 shall be desolate, 8074-8 and your images 2553 shall be broken: 7665-8 and I will cast down 5307-52 your slain 2491 [men] before 6440 your idols. 1544

6:5 And I will lay 5414-1 the dead carcases 6297 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 before 6440 their idols; 1544 and I will scatter 2219-14 your bones 6106 round about 5439 your altars. 4196

6:6 In all your dwellingplaces 4186 the cities 5892 shall be laid waste, 2717-4 and the high places 1116 shall be desolate; 3456-4 that your altars 4196 may be laid waste 2717-4 and made desolate, 816-4 and your idols 1544 may be broken 7665-8 and cease, 7673-8 and your images 2553 may be cut down, 1438-8 and your works 4639 may be abolished. 4229-8

6:7 And the slain 2491 shall fall 5307-1 in the midst 8432 of you, and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

6:8 Yet will I leave a remnant, 3498-52 that ye may have [some] that shall escape 6412 the sword 2719 among the nations, 1471 when ye shall be scattered 2219-9 through the countries. 776

6:9 And they that escape 6412 of you shall remember 2142-1 me among the nations 1471 whither they shall be carried captives, 7617-8 because I am broken 7665-8 with their whorish 2181-6 heart, 3820 which hath departed 5493-1 from me, and with their eyes, 5869 which go a whoring 2181-6 after 310 their idols: 1544 and they shall lothe 6962-8 themselves 6440 for the evils 7451 which they have committed 6213-1 in all their abominations. 8441

6:10 And they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 [and that] I have not said 1696-14 in vain 2600 that I would do 6213-2 this evil 7451 unto them.

6:11 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Smite 5221-54 with thine hand, 3709 and stamp 7554-3 with thy foot, 7272 and say, 559-3 Alas 253 for all the evil 7451 abominations 8441 of the house 1004 of Israel! 3478 for they shall fall 5307-4 by the sword, 2719 by the famine, 7458 and by the pestilence. 1698

6:12 He that is far off 7350 shall die 4191-4 of the pestilence; 1698 and he that is near 7138 shall fall 5307-4 by the sword; 2719 and he that remaineth 7604-12 and is besieged 5341-7 shall die 4191-4 by the famine: 7458 thus will I accomplish 3615-14 my fury 2534 upon them.

6:13 Then shall ye know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 when their slain 2491 [men] shall be among 8432 their idols 1544 round about 5439 their altars, 4196 upon every high 7311-6 hill, 1389 in all the tops 7218 of the mountains, 2022 and under every green 7488 tree, 6086 and under every thick 5687 oak, 424 the place 4725 where they did offer 5414-1 sweet 5207 savour 7381 to all their idols. 1544

6:14 So will I stretch out 5186-1 my hand 3027 upon them, and make 5414-1 the land 776 desolate, 8077 yea, more desolate 4923 than the wilderness 4057 toward Diblath, 1689 in all their habitations: 4186 and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

7:1 Moreover the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

7:2 Also, thou son 1121 of man, 120 thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD 3069 unto the land 127 of Israel; 3478 An end, 7093 the end 7093 is come 935-1 upon the four 702 corners 3671 of the land. 776

7:3 Now [is] the end 7093 [come] upon thee, and I will send 7971-14 mine anger 639 upon thee, and will judge 8199-1 thee according to thy ways, 1870 and will recompense 5414-1 upon thee all thine abominations. 8441

7:4 And mine eye 5869 shall not spare 2347-4 thee, neither will I have pity: 2550-4 but I will recompense 5414-4 thy ways 1870 upon thee, and thine abominations 8441 shall be in the midst 8432 of thee: and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

7:5 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 An evil, 7451 an only 259 evil, 7451 behold, is come. 935-6

7:6 An end 7093 is come, 935-1 the end 7093 is come: 935-1 it watcheth 6974-52 for thee; behold, it is come. 935-6

7:7 The morning 6843 is come 935-1 unto thee, O thou that dwellest 3427-6 in the land: 776 the time 6256 is come, 935-1|935-6-q the day 3117 of trouble 4103 [is] near, 7138 and not the sounding again 1906 of the mountains. 2022

7:8 Now will I shortly 7138 pour out 8210-4 my fury 2534 upon thee, and accomplish 3615-14 mine anger 639 upon thee: and I will judge 8199-1 thee according to thy ways, 1870 and will recompense 5414-1 thee for all thine abominations. 8441

7:9 And mine eye 5869 shall not spare, 2347-4 neither will I have pity: 2550-4 I will recompense 5414-4 thee according to thy ways 1870 and thine abominations 8441 [that] are in the midst 8432 of thee; and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD 3068 that smiteth. 5221-56

7:10 Behold the day, 3117 behold, it is come: 935-6 the morning 6843 is gone forth; 3318-1 the rod 4294 hath blossomed, 6692-1 pride 2087 hath budded. 6524-1

7:11 Violence 2555 is risen up 6965-1 into a rod 4294 of wickedness: 7562 none of them [shall remain], nor of their multitude, 1995 nor of any 1991 of theirs: neither [shall there be] wailing 5089 for them.

7:12 The time 6256 is come, 935-1 the day 3117 draweth near: 5060-52 let not the buyer 7069-6 rejoice, 8055-4 nor the seller 4376-6 mourn: 56-101 for wrath 2740 [is] upon all the multitude 1995 thereof.

7:13 For the seller 4376-6 shall not return 7725-4 to that which is sold, 4465 although they were yet alive: 2416 for the vision 2377 [is] touching the whole multitude 1995 thereof, [which] shall not return; 7725-4 neither shall any 376 strengthen 2388-101 himself in the iniquity 5771 of his life. 2416

7:14 They have blown 8628-1 the trumpet, 8619 even to make all ready; 3559-53 but none goeth 1980-6 to the battle: 4421 for my wrath 2740 [is] upon all the multitude 1995 thereof.

7:15 The sword 2719 [is] without, 2351 and the pestilence 1698 and the famine 7458 within: 1004 he that [is] in the field 7704 shall die 4191-4 with the sword; 2719 and he that [is] in the city, 5892 famine 7458 and pestilence 1698 shall devour 398-4 him.

7:16 But they that escape 6412 of them shall escape, 6403-1 and shall be on the mountains 2022 like doves 3123 of the valleys, 1516 all of them mourning, 1993-6 every one 376 for his iniquity. 5771

7:17 All hands 3027 shall be feeble, 7503-4 and all knees 1290 shall be weak 3212-4 [as] water. 4325

7:18 They shall also gird 2296-1 [themselves] with sackcloth, 8242 and horror 6427 shall cover 3680-14 them; and shame 955 [shall be] upon all faces, 6440 and baldness 7144 upon all their heads. 7218

7:19 They shall cast 7993-55 their silver 3701 in the streets, 2351 and their gold 2091 shall be removed: 5079 their silver 3701 and their gold 2091 shall not be able 3201-4 to deliver 5337-53 them in the day 3117 of the wrath 5678 of the LORD: 3068 they shall not satisfy 7646-17 their souls, 5315 neither fill 4390-17 their bowels: 4578 because it is the stumblingblock 4383 of their iniquity. 5771

7:20 As for the beauty 6643 of his ornament, 5716 he set 7760-1 it in majesty: 1347 but they made 6213-1 the images 6754 of their abominations 8441 [and] of their detestable things 8251 therein: therefore have I set 5414-1 it far 5079 from them.

7:21 And I will give 5414-1 it into the hands 3027 of the strangers 2114-5 for a prey, 957 and to the wicked 7563 of the earth 776 for a spoil; 7998 and they shall pollute 2490-14 it.

7:22 My face 6440 will I turn 5437-52 also from them, and they shall pollute 2490-14 my secret 6845-7 [place]: for the robbers 6530 shall enter 935-1 into it, and defile 2490-14 it.

7:23 Make 6213-3 a chain: 7569 for the land 776 is full 4390-1 of bloody 1818 crimes, 4941 and the city 5892 is full 4390-1 of violence. 2555

7:24 Wherefore I will bring 935-52 the worst 7451 of the heathen, 1471 and they shall possess 3423-1 their houses: 1004 I will also make the pomp 1347 of the strong 5794 to cease; 7673-52 and their holy places 6942-18 shall be defiled. 2490-8|5157-14-q

7:25 Destruction 7089 cometh; 935-1 and they shall seek 1245-14 peace, 7965 and [there shall be] none.

7:26 Mischief 1943 shall come 935-4 upon mischief, 1943 and rumour 8052 shall be upon rumour; 8052 then shall they seek 1245-14 a vision 2377 of the prophet; 5030 but the law 8451 shall perish 6-4 from the priest, 3548 and counsel 6098 from the ancients. 2205

7:27 The king 4428 shall mourn, 56-101 and the prince 5387 shall be clothed 3847-4 with desolation, 8077 and the hands 3027 of the people 5971 of the land 776 shall be troubled: 926-11 I will do 6213-4 unto them after their way, 1870 and according to their deserts 4941 will I judge 8199-4 them; and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

8:1 And it came to pass in the sixth 8345 year, 8141 in the sixth 8345 [month], in the fifth 2568 [day] of the month, 2320 [as] I sat 3427-6 in mine house, 1004 and the elders 2205 of Judah 3063 sat 3427-6 before 6440 me, that the hand 3027 of the Lord 136 GOD 3069 fell 5307-4 there upon me.

8:2 Then I beheld, 7200-4 and lo a likeness 1823 as the appearance 4758 of fire: 784 from the appearance 4758 of his loins 4975 even downward, 4295 fire; 784 and from his loins 4975 even upward, 4605 as the appearance 4758 of brightness, 2096 as the colour 5869 of amber. 2830

8:3 And he put forth 7971-4 the form 8403 of an hand, 3027 and took 3947-4 me by a lock 6734 of mine head; 7218 and the spirit 7307 lifted me up 5375-4 between the earth 776 and the heaven, 8064 and brought 935-55 me in the visions 4759 of God 430 to Jerusalem, 3389 to the door 6607 of the inner 6442 gate 8179 that looketh 6437-6 toward the north; 6828 where [was] the seat 4186 of the image 5566 of jealousy, 7068 which provoketh to jealousy. 7069-56

8:4 And, behold, the glory 3519 of the God 430 of Israel 3478 [was] there, according to the vision 4758 that I saw 7200-1 in the plain. 1237

8:5 Then said 559-4 he unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 lift up 5375-3 thine eyes 5869 now the way 1870 toward the north. 6828 So I lifted up 5375-4 mine eyes 5869 the way 1870 toward the north, 6828 and behold northward 6828 at the gate 8179 of the altar 4196 this image 5566 of jealousy 7068 in the entry. 872

8:6 He said 559-4 furthermore unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 seest 7200-6 thou what they do? 6213-6 [even] the great 1419 abominations 8441 that the house 1004 of Israel 3478 committeth 6213-6 here, that I should go far off 7368-2 from my sanctuary? 4720 but turn 7725-4 thee yet again, [and] thou shalt see 7200-4 greater 1419 abominations. 8441

8:7 And he brought 935-55 me to the door 6607 of the court; 2691 and when I looked, 7200-4 behold a 259 hole 2356 in the wall. 7023

8:8 Then said 559-4 he unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 dig 2864-3 now in the wall: 7023 and when I had digged 2864-4 in the wall, 7023 behold a 259 door. 6607

8:9 And he said 559-4 unto me, Go in, 935-3 and behold 7200-3 the wicked 7451 abominations 8441 that they do 6213-6 here.

8:10 So I went in 935-4 and saw; 7200-4 and behold every form 8403 of creeping things, 7431 and abominable 8263 beasts, 929 and all the idols 1544 of the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 pourtrayed 2707-30 upon the wall 7023 round about. 5439 5439

8:11 And there stood 5975-6 before 6440 them seventy 7657 men 376 of the ancients 2205 of the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 and in the midst 8432 of them stood 5975-6 Jaazaniah 2970 the son 1121 of Shaphan, 8227 with every man 376 his censer 4730 in his hand; 3027 and a thick 6282 cloud 6051 of incense 7004 went up. 5927-6

8:12 Then said 559-4 he unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 hast thou seen 7200-1 what the ancients 2205 of the house 1004 of Israel 3478 do 6213-6 in the dark, 2822 every man 376 in the chambers 2315 of his imagery? 4906 for they say, 559-6 The LORD 3068 seeth 7200-6 us not; the LORD 3068 hath forsaken 5800-1 the earth. 776

8:13 He said 559-4 also unto me, Turn 7725-4 thee yet again, [and] thou shalt see 7200-4 greater 1419 abominations 8441 that they do. 6213-6

8:14 Then he brought 935-55 me to the door 6607 of the gate 8179 of the LORD'S 3068 house 1004 which [was] toward the north; 6828 and, behold, there sat 3427-6 women 802 weeping 1058-18 for Tammuz. 8542

8:15 Then said 559-4 he unto me, Hast thou seen 7200-1 [this], O son 1121 of man? 120 turn 7725-4 thee yet again, [and] thou shalt see 7200-4 greater 1419 abominations 8441 than these.

8:16 And he brought 935-55 me into the inner 6442 court 2691 of the LORD'S 3068 house, 1004 and, behold, at the door 6607 of the temple 1964 of the LORD, 3068 between the porch 197 and the altar, 4196 [were] about five 2568 and twenty 6242 men, 376 with their backs 268 toward the temple 1964 of the LORD, 3068 and their faces 6440 toward the east; 6924 and they worshipped 7812-102 the sun 8121 toward the east. 6924

8:17 Then he said 559-4 unto me, Hast thou seen 7200-1 [this], O son 1121 of man? 120 Is it a light thing 7043-8 to the house 1004 of Judah 3063 that they commit 6213-2 the abominations 8441 which they commit 6213-1 here? for they have filled 4390-1 the land 776 with violence, 2555 and have returned 7725-4 to provoke me to anger: 3707-53 and, lo, they put 7971-6 the branch 2156 to their nose. 639

8:18 Therefore will I also deal 6213-4 in fury: 2534 mine eye 5869 shall not spare, 2347-4 neither will I have pity: 2550-4 and though they cry 7121-1 in mine ears 241 with a loud 1419 voice, 6963 [yet] will I not hear 8085-4 them.

9:1 He cried 7121-4 also in mine ears 241 with a loud 1419 voice, 6963 saying, 559-2 Cause them that have charge 6486 over the city 5892 to draw near, 7126-1 even every man 376 [with] his destroying 4892 weapon 3627 in his hand. 3027

9:2 And, behold, six 8337 men 582 came 935-6 from the way 1870 of the higher 5945 gate, 8179 which lieth 6437-94 toward the north, 6828 and every man 376 a slaughter 4660 weapon 3627 in his hand; 3027 and one 259 man 376 among 8432 them [was] clothed 3847-7 with linen, 906 with a writer's 5608-6 inkhorn 7083 by his side: 4975 and they went in, 935-4 and stood 5975-4 beside 681 the brasen 5178 altar. 4196

9:3 And the glory 3519 of the God 430 of Israel 3478 was gone up 5927-8 from the cherub, 3742 whereupon he was, to the threshold 4670 of the house. 1004 And he called 7121-4 to the man 376 clothed 3847-7 with linen, 906 which [had] the writer's 5608-6 inkhorn 7083 by his side; 4975

9:4 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, Go through 5674-3 the midst 8432 of the city, 5892 through the midst 8432 of Jerusalem, 3389 and set 8427-52 a mark 8420 upon the foreheads 4696 of the men 582 that sigh 584-12 and that cry 602-12 for all the abominations 8441 that be done 6213-12 in the midst 8432 thereof.

9:5 And to the others 428 he said 559-1 in mine hearing, 241 Go 5674-3 ye after 310 him through the city, 5892 and smite: 5221-54 let not your eye 5869 spare, 2347-4 neither have ye pity: 2550-4

9:6 Slay 2026-4 utterly 4889 old 2205 [and] young, 970 both maids, 1330 and little children, 2945 and women: 802 but come not near 5066-4 any man 376 upon whom [is] the mark; 8420 and begin 2490-55 at my sanctuary. 4720 Then they began 2490-55 at the ancient 2205 men 582 which [were] before 6440 the house. 1004

9:7 And he said 559-4 unto them, Defile 2930-16 the house, 1004 and fill 4390-16 the courts 2691 with the slain: 2491 go ye forth. 3318-3 And they went forth, 3318-1 and slew 5221-52 in the city. 5892

9:8 And it came to pass, while they were slaying 5221-53 them, and I was left, 7604-12 that I fell 5307-4 upon my face, 6440 and cried, 2199-4 and said, 559-4 Ah 162 Lord 136 GOD! 3069 wilt thou destroy 7843-56 all the residue 7611 of Israel 3478 in thy pouring out 8210-2 of thy fury 2534 upon Jerusalem? 3389

9:9 Then said 559-4 he unto me, The iniquity 5771 of the house 1004 of Israel 3478 and Judah 3063 [is] exceeding 3966 3966 great, 1419 and the land 776 is full 4390-11 of blood, 1818 and the city 5892 full 4390-1 of perverseness: 4297 for they say, 559-1 The LORD 3068 hath forsaken 5800-1 the earth, 776 and the LORD 3068 seeth 7200-6 not.

9:10 And as for me also, mine eye 5869 shall not spare, 2347-4 neither will I have pity, 2550-4 [but] I will recompense 5414-1 their way 1870 upon their head. 7218

9:11 And, behold, the man 376 clothed 3847-7 with linen, 906 which [had] the inkhorn 7083 by his side, 4975 reported 7725-56 the matter, 1697 saying, 559-2 I have done 6213-1 as thou hast commanded 6680-14 me.

10:1 Then I looked, 7200-4 and, behold, in the firmament 7549 that was above the head 7218 of the cherubims 3742 there appeared 7200-8 over them as it were a sapphire 5601 stone, 68 as the appearance 4758 of the likeness 1823 of a throne. 3678

10:2 And he spake 559-4 unto the man 376 clothed 3847-7 with linen, 906 and said, 559-4 Go in 935-3 between 996 the wheels, 1534 [even] under the cherub, 3742 and fill 4390-16 thine hand 2651 with coals 1513 of fire 784 from between 996 the cherubims, 3742 and scatter 2236-3 [them] over the city. 5892 And he went in 935-4 in my sight. 5869

10:3 Now the cherubims 3742 stood 5975-6 on the right side 3225 of the house, 1004 when the man 376 went in; 935-2 and the cloud 6051 filled 4390-1 the inner 6442 court. 2691

10:4 Then the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 went up 7311-4 from the cherub, 3742 [and stood] over the threshold 4670 of the house; 1004 and the house 1004 was filled 4390-11 with the cloud, 6051 and the court 2691 was full 4390-1 of the brightness 5051 of the LORD'S 3068 glory. 3519

10:5 And the sound 6963 of the cherubims' 3742 wings 3671 was heard 8085-8 [even] to the outer 2435 court, 2691 as the voice 6963 of the Almighty 7706 God 410 when he speaketh. 1696-15

10:6 And it came to pass, [that] when he had commanded 6680-15 the man 376 clothed 3847-7 with linen, 906 saying, 559-2 Take 3947-3 fire 784 from between the wheels, 1534 from between the cherubims; 3742 then he went in, 935-4 and stood 5975-4 beside 681 the wheels. 212

10:7 And [one] cherub 3742 stretched forth 7971-4 his hand 3027 from between the cherubims 3742 unto the fire 784 that [was] between the cherubims, 3742 and took 5375-4 [thereof], and put 5414-4 [it] into the hands 2651 of [him that was] clothed 3847-7 with linen: 906 who took 3947-4 [it], and went out. 3318-4

10:8 And there appeared 7200-11 in the cherubims 3742 the form 8403 of a man's 120 hand 3027 under their wings. 3671

10:9 And when I looked, 7200-4 behold the four 702 wheels 212 by 681 the cherubims, 3742 one 259 wheel 212 by 681 one 259 cherub, 3742 and another 259 wheel 212 by 681 another 259 cherub: 3742 and the appearance 4758 of the wheels 212 [was] as the colour 5869 of a beryl 8658 stone. 68

10:10 And [as for] their appearances, 4758 they four 702 had one 259 likeness, 1823 as if a wheel 212 had been in the midst 8432 of a wheel. 212

10:11 When they went, 3212-2 they went 3212-4 upon their four 702 sides; 7253 they turned 5437-11 not as they went, 3212-2 but to the place 4725 whither the head 7218 looked 6437-4 they followed 3212-4 310 it; they turned 5437-11 not as they went. 3212-2

10:12 And their whole body, 1320 and their backs, 1354 and their hands, 3027 and their wings, 3671 and the wheels, 212 [were] full 4392 of eyes 5869 round about, 5439 [even] the wheels 212 that they four 702 had.

10:13 As for the wheels, 212 it was cried 7121-27 unto them in my hearing, 241 O wheel. 1534

10:14 And every one 259 had four 702 faces: 6440 the first 259 face 6440 [was] the face 6440 of a cherub, 3742 and the second 8145 face 6440 [was] the face 6440 of a man, 120 and the third 7992 the face 6440 of a lion, 738 and the fourth 7243 the face 6440 of an eagle. 5404

10:15 And the cherubims 3742 were lifted up. 7426-11 This [is] the living creature 2416 that I saw 7200-1 by the river 5104 of Chebar. 3529

10:16 And when the cherubims 3742 went, 3212-2 the wheels 212 went 3212-4 by them: 681 and when the cherubims 3742 lifted up 5375-2 their wings 3671 to mount up 7311-2 from the earth, 776 the same 1992 wheels 212 also turned 5437-11 not from beside 681 them.

10:17 When they stood, 5975-2 [these] stood; 5975-4 and when they were lifted up, 7311-2 [these] lifted up 7426-11 themselves [also]: for the spirit 7307 of the living creature 2416 [was] in them.

10:18 Then the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 departed 3318-4 from off the threshold 4670 of the house, 1004 and stood 5975-4 over the cherubims. 3742

10:19 And the cherubims 3742 lifted up 5375-4 their wings, 3671 and mounted up 7426-11 from the earth 776 in my sight: 5869 when they went out, 3318-2 the wheels 212 also [were] beside 5980 them, and [every one] stood 5975-4 at the door 6607 of the east 6931 gate 8179 of the LORD'S 3068 house; 1004 and the glory 3519 of the God 430 of Israel 3478 [was] over them above. 4605

10:20 This [is] the living creature 2416 that I saw 7200-1 under the God 430 of Israel 3478 by the river 5104 of Chebar; 3529 and I knew 3045-4 that they [were] the cherubims. 3742

10:21 Every one 259 had four 702 702 faces 6440 apiece, and every one 259 four 702 wings; 3671 and the likeness 1823 of the hands 3027 of a man 120 [was] under their wings. 3671

10:22 And the likeness 1823 of their faces 6440 [was] the same 1992 faces 6440 which I saw 7200-1 by the river 5104 of Chebar, 3529 their appearances 4758 and themselves: they went 3212-4 every one 376 straight 5676 forward. 6440

11:1 Moreover the spirit 7307 lifted me up, 5375-4 and brought 935-55 me unto the east 6931 gate 8179 of the LORD'S 3068 house, 1004 which looketh 6437-6 eastward: 6921 and behold at the door 6607 of the gate 8179 five 2568 and twenty 6242 men; 376 among 8432 whom I saw 7200-4 Jaazaniah 2970 the son 1121 of Azur, 5809 and Pelatiah 6410 the son 1121 of Benaiah, 1141 princes 8269 of the people. 5971

11:2 Then said 559-4 he unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 these [are] the men 582 that devise 2803-6 mischief, 205 and give 3289-6 wicked 7451 counsel 6098 in this city: 5892

11:3 Which say, 559-6 [It is] not near; 7138 let us build 1129-2 houses: 1004 this [city is] the caldron, 5518 and we [be] the flesh. 1320

11:4 Therefore prophesy 5012-10 against them, prophesy, 5012-10 O son 1121 of man. 120

11:5 And the Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 fell 5307-4 upon me, and said 559-4 unto me, Speak; 559-3 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Thus have ye said, 559-1 O house 1004 of Israel: 3478 for I know 3045-1 the things that come 4609 into your mind, 7307 [every one of] them.

11:6 Ye have multiplied 7235-52 your slain 2491 in this city, 5892 and ye have filled 4390-14 the streets 2351 thereof with the slain. 2491

11:7 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Your slain 2491 whom ye have laid 7760-1 in the midst 8432 of it, they [are] the flesh, 1320 and this [city is] the caldron: 5518 but I will bring you forth 3318-52 out of the midst 8432 of it.

11:8 Ye have feared 3372-1 the sword; 2719 and I will bring 935-55 a sword 2719 upon you, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

11:9 And I will bring you out 3318-52 of the midst 8432 thereof, and deliver 5414-1 you into the hands 3027 of strangers, 2114-5 and will execute 6213-1 judgments 8201 among you.

11:10 Ye shall fall 5307-4 by the sword; 2719 I will judge 8199-4 you in the border 1366 of Israel; 3478 and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

11:11 This [city] shall not be your caldron, 5518 neither shall ye be the flesh 1320 in the midst 8432 thereof; [but] I will judge 8199-4 you in the border 1366 of Israel: 3478

11:12 And ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD: 3068 for ye have not walked 1980-1 in my statutes, 2706 neither executed 6213-1 my judgments, 4941 but have done 6213-1 after the manners 4941 of the heathen 1471 that [are] round about 5439 you.

11:13 And it came to pass, when I prophesied, 5012-9 that Pelatiah 6410 the son 1121 of Benaiah 1141 died. 4191-1 Then fell I down 5307-4 upon my face, 6440 and cried 2199-4 with a loud 1419 voice, 6963 and said, 559-4 Ah 162 Lord 136 GOD! 3069 wilt thou make 6213-6 a full end 3617 of the remnant 7611 of Israel? 3478

11:14 Again the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

11:15 Son 1121 of man, 120 thy brethren, 251 [even] thy brethren, 251 the men 582 of thy kindred, 1353 and all the house 1004 of Israel 3478 wholly, [are] they unto whom the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem 3389 have said, 559-1 Get you far 7368-3 from the LORD: 3068 unto us is this land 776 given 5414-8 in possession. 4181

11:16 Therefore say, 559-3 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Although I have cast them far off 7368-52 among the heathen, 1471 and although I have scattered 6327-52 them among the countries, 776 yet will I be to them as a little 4592 sanctuary 4720 in the countries 776 where they shall come. 935-1

11:17 Therefore say, 559-3 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 I will even gather 6908-14 you from the people, 5971 and assemble 622-1 you out of the countries 776 where ye have been scattered, 6327-8 and I will give 5414-1 you the land 127 of Israel. 3478

11:18 And they shall come 935-1 thither, and they shall take away 5493-52 all the detestable things 8251 thereof and all the abominations 8441 thereof from thence.

11:19 And I will give 5414-1 them one 259 heart, 3820 and I will put 5414-4 a new 2319 spirit 7307 within 7130 you; and I will take 5493-52 the stony 68 heart 3820 out of their flesh, 1320 and will give 5414-1 them an heart 3820 of flesh: 1320

11:20 That they may walk 3212-4 in my statutes, 2708 and keep 8104-4 mine ordinances, 4941 and do 6213-1 them: and they shall be my people, 5971 and I will be their God. 430

11:21 But [as for them] whose heart 3820 walketh 1980-6 after the heart 3820 of their detestable things 8251 and their abominations, 8441 I will recompense 5414-1 their way 1870 upon their own heads, 7218 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

11:22 Then did the cherubims 3742 lift up 5375-4 their wings, 3671 and the wheels 212 beside 5980 them; and the glory 3519 of the God 430 of Israel 3478 [was] over them above. 4605

11:23 And the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 went up 5927-4 from the midst 8432 of the city, 5892 and stood 5975-4 upon the mountain 2022 which [is] on the east side 6924 of the city. 5892

11:24 Afterwards the spirit 7307 took me up, 5375-1 and brought 935-55 me in a vision 4758 by the Spirit 7307 of God 430 into Chaldea, 3778 to them of the captivity. 1473 So the vision 4758 that I had seen 7200-1 went up 5927-4 from me.

11:25 Then I spake 1696-17 unto them of the captivity 1473 all the things 1697 that the LORD 3068 had shewed 7200-52 me.

12:1 The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 also came unto me, saying, 559-2

12:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 thou dwellest 3427-6 in the midst 8432 of a rebellious 4805 house, 1004 which have eyes 5869 to see, 7200-2 and see 7200-1 not; they have ears 241 to hear, 8085-2 and hear 8085-1 not: for they [are] a rebellious 4805 house. 1004

12:3 Therefore, thou son 1121 of man, 120 prepare 6213-3 thee stuff 3627 for removing, 1473 and remove 1540-3 by day 3119 in their sight; 5869 and thou shalt remove 1540-1 from thy place 4725 to another 312 place 4725 in their sight: 5869 it may be they will consider, 7200-4 though they [be] a rebellious 4805 house. 1004

12:4 Then shalt thou bring forth 3318-52 thy stuff 3627 by day 3119 in their sight, 5869 as stuff 3627 for removing: 1473 and thou shalt go forth 3318-4 at even 6153 in their sight, 5869 as they that go forth 4161 into captivity. 1473

12:5 Dig 2864-3 thou through the wall 7023 in their sight, 5869 and carry out 3318-52 thereby.

12:6 In their sight 5869 shalt thou bear 5375-4 [it] upon [thy] shoulders, 3802 [and] carry [it] forth 3318-55 in the twilight: 5939 thou shalt cover 3680-17 thy face, 6440 that thou see 7200-4 not the ground: 776 for I have set 5414-1 thee [for] a sign 4159 unto the house 1004 of Israel. 3478

12:7 And I did 6213-4 so as I was commanded: 6680-27 I brought forth 3318-52 my stuff 3627 by day, 3119 as stuff 3627 for captivity, 1473 and in the even 6153 I digged 2864-1 through the wall 7023 with mine hand; 3027 I brought [it] forth 3318-52 in the twilight, 5939 [and] I bare 5375-1 [it] upon [my] shoulder 3802 in their sight. 5869

12:8 And in the morning 1242 came the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 unto me, saying, 559-2

12:9 Son 1121 of man, 120 hath not the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 the rebellious 4805 house, 1004 said 559-1 unto thee, What doest 6213-6 thou?

12:10 Say 559-3 thou unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 This burden 4853 [concerneth] the prince 5387 in Jerusalem, 3389 and all the house 1004 of Israel 3478 that [are] among 8432 them.

12:11 Say, 559-3 I [am] your sign: 4159 like as I have done, 6213-1 so shall it be done 6213-11 unto them: they shall remove 1473 [and] go 3212-4 into captivity. 7628

12:12 And the prince 5387 that [is] among 8432 them shall bear 5375-4 upon [his] shoulder 3802 in the twilight, 5939 and shall go forth: 3318-4 they shall dig 2864-4 through the wall 7023 to carry out 3318-53 thereby: he shall cover 3680-17 his face, 6440 that 3282 he see 7200-4 not the ground 776 with [his] eyes. 5869

12:13 My net 7568 also will I spread 6566-1 upon him, and he shall be taken 8610-8 in my snare: 4686 and I will bring 935-52 him to Babylon 894 [to] the land 776 of the Chaldeans; 3778 yet shall he not see 7200-4 it, though he shall die 4191-4 there.

12:14 And I will scatter 2219-17 toward every wind 7307 all that [are] about 5439 him to help 5828 him, and all his bands; 102 and I will draw out 7324-55 the sword 2719 after 310 them.

12:15 And they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 when I shall scatter 6327-53 them among the nations, 1471 and disperse 2219-14 them in the countries. 776

12:16 But I will leave 3498-52 a few 4557 men 582 of them from the sword, 2719 from the famine, 7458 and from the pestilence; 1698 that they may declare 5608-17 all their abominations 8441 among the heathen 1471 whither they come; 935-1 and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

12:17 Moreover the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came to me, saying, 559-2

12:18 Son 1121 of man, 120 eat 398-4 thy bread 3899 with quaking, 7494 and drink 8354-4 thy water 4325 with trembling 7269 and with carefulness; 1674

12:19 And say 559-1 unto the people 5971 of the land, 776 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD 3069 of the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem, 3389 [and] of the land 127 of Israel; 3478 They shall eat 398-4 their bread 3899 with carefulness, 1674 and drink 8354-4 their water 4325 with astonishment, 8078 that her land 776 may be desolate 3456-4 from all that is therein, 4393 because of the violence 2555 of all them that dwell 3427-6 therein.

12:20 And the cities 5892 that are inhabited 3427-12 shall be laid waste, 2717-4 and the land 776 shall be desolate; 8077 and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

12:21 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

12:22 Son 1121 of man, 120 what [is] that proverb 4912 [that] ye have in the land 127 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 The days 3117 are prolonged, 748-4 and every vision 2377 faileth? 6-1

12:23 Tell 559-3 them therefore, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 I will make this proverb 4912 to cease, 7673-52 and they shall no more use it as a proverb 4911-4 in Israel; 3478 but say 1696-16 unto them, The days 3117 are at hand, 7126-1 and the effect 1697 of every vision. 2377

12:24 For there shall be no more any vain 7723 vision 2377 nor flattering 2509 divination 4738 within 8432 the house 1004 of Israel. 3478

12:25 For I [am] the LORD: 3068 I will speak, 1696-17 and the word 1697 that I shall speak 1696-17 shall come to pass; 6213-11 it shall be no more prolonged: 4900-11 for in your days, 3117 O rebellious 4805 house, 1004 will I say 1696-17 the word, 1697 and will perform 6213-1 it, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

12:26 Again the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came to me, saying, 559-2

12:27 Son 1121 of man, 120 behold, [they of] the house 1004 of Israel 3478 say, 559-6 The vision 2377 that he seeth 2372-6 [is] for many 7227 days 3117 [to come], and he prophesieth 5012-8 of the times 6256 [that are] far off. 7350

12:28 Therefore say 559-3 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 There shall none of my words 1697 be prolonged 4900-11 any more, but the word 1697 which I have spoken 1696-17 shall be done, 6213-11 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

13:1 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

13:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 prophesy 5012-10 against the prophets 5030 of Israel 3478 that prophesy, 5012-12 and say 559-1 thou unto them that prophesy 5030 out of their own hearts, 3820 Hear 8085-3 ye the word 1697 of the LORD; 3068

13:3 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Woe 1945 unto the foolish 5036 prophets, 5030 that follow 1980-6 310 their own spirit, 7307 and have seen 7200-1 nothing!

13:4 O Israel, 3478 thy prophets 5030 are like the foxes 7776 in the deserts. 2723

13:5 Ye have not gone up 5927-1 into the gaps, 6556 neither made up 1443-4 the hedge 1447 for the house 1004 of Israel 3478 to stand 5975-2 in the battle 4421 in the day 3117 of the LORD. 3068

13:6 They have seen 2372-1 vanity 7723 and lying 3577 divination, 7081 saying, 559-6 The LORD 3068 saith: 5002-7 and the LORD 3068 hath not sent 7971-1 them: and they have made [others] to hope 3176-14 that they would confirm 6965-15 the word. 1697

13:7 Have ye not seen 2372-1 a vain 7723 vision, 4236 and have ye not spoken 559-1 a lying 3577 divination, 4738 whereas ye say, 559-6 The LORD 3068 saith 5002-7 [it]; albeit I have not spoken? 1696-14

13:8 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Because ye have spoken 1696-15 vanity, 7723 and seen 2372-1 lies, 3577 therefore, behold, I [am] against you, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

13:9 And mine hand 3027 shall be upon the prophets 5030 that see 2374 vanity, 7723 and that divine 7080-6 lies: 3577 they shall not be in the assembly 5475 of my people, 5971 neither shall they be written 3789-11 in the writing 3791 of the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 neither shall they enter 935-4 into the land 127 of Israel; 3478 and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

13:10 Because, even because they have seduced 2937-52 my people, 5971 saying, 559-2 Peace; 7965 and [there was] no peace; 7965 and one built up 1129-6 a wall, 2434 and, lo, 2009 others daubed 2902-6 it with untempered 8602 [morter]:

13:11 Say 559-3 unto them which daub 2902-6 [it] with untempered 8602 [morter], that it shall fall: 5307-4 there shall be an overflowing 7857-6 shower; 1653 and ye, 859 O great hailstones, 417 68 shall fall; 5307-4 and a stormy 5591 wind 7307 shall rend 1234-17 [it].

13:12 Lo, when the wall 7023 is fallen, 5307-1 shall it not be said 559-11 unto you, Where [is] the daubing 2915 wherewith ye have daubed 2902-1 [it]?

13:13 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 I will even rend 1234-14 [it] with a stormy 5591 wind 7307 in my fury; 2534 and there shall be an overflowing 7857-6 shower 1653 in mine anger, 639 and great hailstones 417 68 in [my] fury 2534 to consume 3617 [it].

13:14 So will I break down 2040-1 the wall 7023 that ye have daubed 2902-1 with untempered 8602 [morter], and bring it down 5060-52 to the ground, 776 so that the foundation 3247 thereof shall be discovered, 1540-8 and it shall fall, 5307-1 and ye shall be consumed 3615-1 in the midst 8432 thereof: and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

13:15 Thus will I accomplish 3615-14 my wrath 2534 upon the wall, 7023 and upon them that have daubed 2902-6 it with untempered 8602 [morter], and will say 559-4 unto you, The wall 7023 [is] no [more], neither they that daubed 2902-6 it;

13:16 [To wit], the prophets 5030 of Israel 3478 which prophesy 5012-12 concerning Jerusalem, 3389 and which see 2374 visions 2377 of peace 7965 for her, and [there is] no peace, 7965 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

13:17 Likewise, thou son 1121 of man, 120 set 7760-3 thy face 6440 against the daughters 1323 of thy people, 5971 which prophesy 5012-102 out of their own heart; 3820 and prophesy 5012-10 thou against them,

13:18 And say, 559-1 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Woe 1945 to the [women] that sew 8609-18 pillows 3704 to all armholes, 679 3027 and make 6213-6 kerchiefs 4555 upon the head 7218 of every stature 6967 to hunt 6679-23 souls! 5315 Will ye hunt 6679-25 the souls 5315 of my people, 5971 and will ye save the souls 5315 alive 2421-17 [that come] unto you?

13:19 And will ye pollute 2490-17 me among my people 5971 for handfuls 8168 of barley 8184 and for pieces 6595 of bread, 3899 to slay 4191-53 the souls 5315 that should not die, 4191-4 and to save the souls 5315 alive 2421-15 that should not live, 2421-4 by your lying 3576-15 to my people 5971 that hear 8085-6 [your] lies? 3577

13:20 Wherefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I [am] against your pillows, 3704 wherewith ye 859 there hunt 6679-26 the souls 5315 to make [them] fly, 6524-6 and I will tear 7167-1 them from your arms, 2220 and will let the souls 5315 go, 7971-14 [even] the souls 5315 that ye hunt 6679-26 to make [them] fly. 6524-6

13:21 Your kerchiefs 4555 also will I tear, 7167-1 and deliver 5337-52 my people 5971 out of your hand, 3027 and they shall be no more in your hand 3027 to be hunted; 4686 and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

13:22 Because with lies 8267 ye have made the heart 3820 of the righteous 6662 sad, 3512-53 whom I have not made sad; 3510-52 and strengthened 2388-15 the hands 3027 of the wicked, 7451 that he should not return 7725-2 from his wicked 7563 way, 1870 by promising him life: 2421-53

13:23 Therefore ye shall see 2372-4 no more vanity, 7723 nor divine 7080-4 divinations: 7081 for I will deliver 5337-52 my people 5971 out of your hand: 3027 and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

14:1 Then came 935-4 certain 582 of the elders 2205 of Israel 3478 unto me, and sat 3427-4 before 6440 me.

14:2 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

14:3 Son 1121 of man, 120 these men 582 have set up 5927-52 their idols 1544 in their heart, 3820 and put 5414-1 the stumblingblock 4383 of their iniquity 5771 before 5227 their face: 6440 should I be enquired 1875-11 of at all 1875-9 by them?

14:4 Therefore speak 1696-16 unto them, and say 559-1 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Every man 376 376 of the house 1004 of Israel 3478 that setteth up 5927-55 his idols 1544 in his heart, 3820 and putteth 7760-4 the stumblingblock 4383 of his iniquity 5771 before 5227 his face, 6440 and cometh 935-1 to the prophet; 5030 I the LORD 3068 will answer 6030-8 him that cometh 935-1 according to the multitude 7230 of his idols; 1544

14:5 That I may take 8610-2 the house 1004 of Israel 3478 in their own heart, 3820 because they are all estranged 2114-8 from me through their idols. 1544

14:6 Therefore say 559-3 unto the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Repent, 7725-3 and turn 7725-54 [yourselves] from your idols; 1544 and turn away 7725-54 your faces 6440 from all your abominations. 8441

14:7 For every one 376 376 of the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 or of the stranger 1616 that sojourneth 1481-4 in Israel, 3478 which separateth 5144-11 himself from 310 me, and setteth up 5927-4 his idols 1544 in his heart, 3820 and putteth 7760-4 the stumblingblock 4383 of his iniquity 5771 before 5227 his face, 6440 and cometh 935-1 to a prophet 5030 to enquire 1875-2 of him concerning me; I the LORD 3068 will answer 6030-12 him by myself:

14:8 And I will set 5414-1 my face 6440 against that man, 376 and will make 8074-52 him a sign 226 and a proverb, 4912 and I will cut him off 3772-52 from the midst 8432 of my people; 5971 and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

14:9 And if the prophet 5030 be deceived 6601-29 when he hath spoken 1696-14 a thing, 1697 I the LORD 3068 have deceived 6601-14 that prophet, 5030 and I will stretch out 5186-1 my hand 3027 upon him, and will destroy 8045-52 him from the midst 8432 of my people 5971 Israel. 3478

14:10 And they shall bear 5375-1 the punishment of their iniquity: 5771 the punishment 5771 of the prophet 5030 shall be even as the punishment 5771 of him that seeketh 1875-6 [unto him];

14:11 That the house 1004 of Israel 3478 may go no more astray 8582-4 from 310 me, neither be polluted 2930-101 any more with all their transgressions; 6588 but that they may be my people, 5971 and I may be their God, 430 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

14:12 The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came again to me, saying, 559-2

14:13 Son 1121 of man, 120 when the land 776 sinneth 2398-4 against me by trespassing 4603-2 grievously, 4604 then will I stretch out 5186-1 mine hand 3027 upon it, and will break 7665-1 the staff 4294 of the bread 3899 thereof, and will send 7971-52 famine 7458 upon it, and will cut off 3772-52 man 120 and beast 929 from it:

14:14 Though these three 7969 men, 582 Noah, 5146 Daniel, 1840 and Job, 347 were in it, 8432 they should deliver 5337-17 [but] their own souls 5315 by their righteousness, 6666 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

14:15 If 3863 I cause noisome 7451 beasts 2416 to pass 5674-55 through the land, 776 and they spoil 7921-14 it, so that it be desolate, 8077 that no man may pass through 5674-6 because 6440 of the beasts: 2416

14:16 [Though] these three 7969 men 582 [were] in it, 8432 [as] I live, 2416 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 they shall deliver 5337-55 neither sons 1121 nor daughters; 1323 they only shall be delivered, 5337-11 but the land 776 shall be desolate. 8077

14:17 Or [if] I bring 935-55 a sword 2719 upon that land, 776 and say, 559-1 Sword, 2719 go 5674-4 through the land; 776 so that I cut off 3772-52 man 120 and beast 929 from it:

14:18 Though these three 7969 men 582 [were] in it, 8432 [as] I live, 2416 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 they shall deliver 5337-55 neither sons 1121 nor daughters, 1323 but they only shall be delivered 5337-11 themselves.

14:19 Or [if] I send 7971-17 a pestilence 1698 into that land, 776 and pour out 8210-1 my fury 2534 upon it in blood, 1818 to cut off 3772-53 from it man 120 and beast: 929

14:20 Though Noah, 5146 Daniel, 1840 and Job, 347 [were] in it, 8432 [as] I live, 2416 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 they shall deliver 5337-55 neither 518 son 1121 nor 518 daughter; 1323 they shall [but] deliver 5337-55 their own souls 5315 by their righteousness. 6666

14:21 For thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 How much more when I send 7971-14 my four 702 sore 7451 judgments 8201 upon Jerusalem, 3389 the sword, 2719 and the famine, 7458 and the noisome 7451 beast, 2416 and the pestilence, 1698 to cut off 3772-53 from it man 120 and beast? 929

14:22 Yet, behold, therein shall be left 3498-8 a remnant 6413 that shall be brought forth, 3318-94 [both] sons 1121 and daughters: 1323 behold, they shall come forth 3318-6 unto you, and ye shall see 7200-1 their way 1870 and their doings: 5949 and ye shall be comforted 5162-8 concerning the evil 7451 that I have brought 935-52 upon Jerusalem, 3389 [even] concerning all that I have brought 935-52 upon it.

14:23 And they shall comfort 5162-14 you, when ye see 7200-4 their ways 1870 and their doings: 5949 and ye shall know 3045-1 that I have not done 6213-1 without cause 2600 all that I have done 6213-1 in it, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

15:1 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

15:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 What is the vine 1612 tree 6086 more than any tree, 6086 [or than] a branch 2156 which is among the trees 6086 of the forest? 3293

15:3 Shall wood 6086 be taken 3947-93 thereof to do 6213-2 any work? 4399 or will [men] take 3947-4 a pin 3489 of it to hang 8518-2 any vessel 3627 thereon?

15:4 Behold, it is cast 5414-8 into the fire 784 for fuel; 402 the fire 784 devoureth 398-1 both 8147 the ends 7098 of it, and the midst 8432 of it is burned. 2787-12 Is it meet 6743-4 for [any] work? 4399

15:5 Behold, when it was whole, 8549 it was meet 6213-11 for no work: 4399 how much less shall it be meet 6213-8 yet for [any] work, 4399 when the fire 784 hath devoured 398-1 it, and it is burned? 2787-11

15:6 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 As the vine 1612 tree 6086 among the trees 6086 of the forest, 3293 which I have given 5414-1 to the fire 784 for fuel, 402 so will I give 5414-1 the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem. 3389

15:7 And I will set 5414-1 my face 6440 against them; they shall go out 3318-1 from [one] fire, 784 and [another] fire 784 shall devour 398-4 them; and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 when I set 7760-2 my face 6440 against them.

15:8 And I will make 5414-1 the land 776 desolate, 8077 because they have committed 4603-1 a trespass, 4604 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

16:1 Again the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

16:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 cause Jerusalem 3389 to know 3045-54 her abominations, 8441

16:3 And say, 559-1 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD 3069 unto Jerusalem; 3389 Thy birth 4351 and thy nativity 4138 [is] of the land 776 of Canaan; 3669 thy father 1 [was] an Amorite, 567 and thy mother 517 an Hittite. 2850

16:4 And [as for] thy nativity, 4138 in the day 3117 thou wast born 3205-91 thy navel 8270 was not cut, 3772-27 neither wast thou washed 7364-27 in water 4325 to supple 4935 [thee]; thou wast not salted 4414-90 at all, 4414-91 nor swaddled 2853-27 at all. 2853-91

16:5 None eye 5869 pitied 2347-1 thee, to do 6213-2 any 259 of these unto thee, to have compassion 2550-2 upon thee; but thou wast cast out 7993-93 in the open 6440 field, 7704 to the lothing 1604 of thy person, 5315 in the day 3117 that thou wast born. 3205-91

16:6 And when I passed 5674-4 by thee, and saw 7200-4 thee polluted 947-114 in thine own blood, 1818 I said 559-4 unto thee [when thou wast] in thy blood, 1818 Live; 2421-3 yea, I said 559-4 unto thee [when thou wast] in thy blood, 1818 Live. 2421-3

16:7 I have caused 5414-1 thee to multiply 7233 as the bud 6780 of the field, 7704 and thou hast increased 7235-4 and waxen great, 1431-4 and thou art come 935-4 to excellent 5716 ornaments: 5716 [thy] breasts 7699 are fashioned, 3559-8 and thine hair 8181 is grown, 6779-14 whereas thou [wast] naked 5903 and bare. 6181

16:8 Now when I passed 5674-4 by thee, and looked 7200-4 upon thee, behold, thy time 6256 [was] the time 6256 of love; 1730 and I spread 6566-4 my skirt 3671 over thee, and covered 3680-17 thy nakedness: 6172 yea, I sware 7650-11 unto thee, and entered 935-4 into a covenant 1285 with thee, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 and thou becamest mine.

16:9 Then washed 7364-4 I thee with water; 4325 yea, I throughly washed away 7857-4 thy blood 1818 from thee, and I anointed 5480-4 thee with oil. 8081

16:10 I clothed 3847-55 thee also with broidered work, 7553 and shod 5274-4 thee with badgers' 8476 skin, and I girded 2280-4 thee about with fine linen, 8336 and I covered 3680-17 thee with silk. 4897

16:11 I decked 5710-4 thee also with ornaments, 5716 and I put 5414-4 bracelets 6781 upon thy hands, 3027 and a chain 7242 on thy neck. 1627

16:12 And I put 5414-4 a jewel 5141 on thy forehead, 639 and earrings 5694 in thine ears, 241 and a beautiful 8597 crown 5850 upon thine head. 7218

16:13 Thus wast thou decked 5710-4 with gold 2091 and silver; 3701 and thy raiment 4403 [was of] fine linen, 8336 and silk, 4897 and broidered work; 7553 thou didst eat 398-1 fine flour, 5560 and honey, 1706 and oil: 8081 and thou wast exceeding 3966 3966 beautiful, 3302-4 and thou didst prosper 6743-4 into a kingdom. 4410

16:14 And thy renown 8034 went forth 3318-4 among the heathen 1471 for thy beauty: 3308 for it [was] perfect 3632 through my comeliness, 1926 which I had put 7760-1 upon thee, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

16:15 But thou didst trust 982-4 in thine own beauty, 3308 and playedst the harlot 2181-4 because of thy renown, 8034 and pouredst out 8210-4 thy fornications 8457 on every one that passed by; 5674-6 his it was.

16:16 And of thy garments 899 thou didst take, 3947-4 and deckedst 6213-4 thy high places 1116 with divers colours, 2921-7 and playedst the harlot 2181-4 thereupon: [the like things] shall not come, 935-6 neither shall it be [so].

16:17 Thou hast also taken 3947-4 thy fair 8597 jewels 3627 of my gold 2091 and of my silver, 3701 which I had given 5414-1 thee, and madest 6213-4 to thyself images 6754 of men, 2145 and didst commit whoredom 2181-4 with them,

16:18 And tookest 3947-4 thy broidered 7553 garments, 899 and coveredst 3680-17 them: and thou hast set 5414-1 mine oil 8081 and mine incense 7004 before 6440 them.

16:19 My meat 3899 also which I gave 5414-1 thee, fine flour, 5560 and oil, 8081 and honey, 1706 [wherewith] I fed 398-52 thee, thou hast even set 5414-1 it before 6440 them for a sweet 5207 savour: 7381 and [thus] it was, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

16:20 Moreover thou hast taken 3947-4 thy sons 1121 and thy daughters, 1323 whom thou hast borne 3205-1 unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed 2076-4 unto them to be devoured. 398-2 [Is this] of thy whoredoms 8457 a small matter, 4592

16:21 That thou hast slain 7819-4 my children, 1121 and delivered 5414-4 them to cause them to pass through 5674-53 [the fire] for them?

16:22 And in all thine abominations 8441 and thy whoredoms 8457 thou hast not remembered 2142-1 the days 3117 of thy youth, 5271 when thou wast naked 5903 and bare, 6181 [and] wast polluted 947-114 in thy blood. 1818

16:23 And it came to pass after 310 all thy wickedness, 7451 (woe, 188 woe 188 unto thee! saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD;) 3069

16:24 [That] thou hast also built 1129-4 unto thee an eminent place, 1354 and hast made 6213-4 thee an high place 7413 in every street. 7339

16:25 Thou hast built 1129-1 thy high place 7413 at every head 7218 of the way, 1870 and hast made thy beauty 3308 to be abhorred, 8581-17 and hast opened 6589-17 thy feet 7272 to every one that passed by, 5674-6 and multiplied 7235-55 thy whoredoms. 8457

16:26 Thou hast also committed fornication 2181-4 with the Egyptians 1121 4714 thy neighbours, 7934 great 1432 of flesh; 1320 and hast increased 7235-55 thy whoredoms, 8457 to provoke me to anger. 3707-53

16:27 Behold, therefore I have stretched out 5186-1 my hand 3027 over thee, and have diminished 1639-4 thine ordinary 2706 [food], and delivered 5414-4 thee unto the will 5315 of them that hate 8130-6 thee, the daughters 1323 of the Philistines, 6430 which are ashamed 3637-12 of thy lewd 2154 way. 1870

16:28 Thou hast played the whore 2181-4 also with the Assyrians, 1121 804 because thou wast unsatiable; 1115 7654 yea, thou hast played the harlot 2181-4 with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied. 7646-1

16:29 Thou hast moreover multiplied 7235-55 thy fornication 8457 in the land 776 of Canaan 3667 unto Chaldea; 3778 and yet thou wast not satisfied 7646-1 herewith. 2063

16:30 How weak 535-6 is thine heart, 3826 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 seeing thou doest 6213-2 all these [things], the work 4639 of an imperious 7986 whorish 2181-6 woman; 802

16:31 In that thou buildest 1129-2 thine eminent place 1354 in the head 7218 of every way, 1870 and makest 6213-1 thine high place 7413 in every street; 7339 and hast not been as an harlot, 2181-6 in that thou scornest 7046-15 hire; 868

16:32 [But as] a wife 802 that committeth adultery, 5003-18 [which] taketh 3947-4 strangers 2114-5 instead of her husband! 376

16:33 They give 5414-4 gifts 5078 to all whores: 2181-6 but thou givest 5414-1 thy gifts 5083 to all thy lovers, 157-18 and hirest 7809-4 them, that they may come 935-2 unto thee on every side 5439 for thy whoredom. 8457

16:34 And the contrary 2016 is in thee from [other] women 802 in thy whoredoms, 8457 whereas none followeth 310 thee to commit whoredoms: 2181-27 and in that thou givest 5414-2 a reward, 868 and no reward 868 is given 5414-8 unto thee, therefore thou art 1961-4 contrary. 2016

16:35 Wherefore, O harlot, 2181-6 hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD: 3068

16:36 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Because thy filthiness 5178 was poured out, 8210-9 and thy nakedness 6172 discovered 1540-11 through thy whoredoms 8457 with thy lovers, 157-18 and with all the idols 1544 of thy abominations, 8441 and by the blood 1818 of thy children, 1121 which thou didst give 5414-1 unto them;

16:37 Behold, therefore I will gather 6908-18 all thy lovers, 157-18 with whom thou hast taken pleasure, 6149-1 and all [them] that thou hast loved, 157-1 with all [them] that thou hast hated; 8130-1 I will even gather 6908-14 them round about 5439 against thee, and will discover 1540-14 thy nakedness 6172 unto them, that they may see 7200-1 all thy nakedness. 6172

16:38 And I will judge 8199-1 thee, as women that break wedlock 5003-6 and shed 8210-6 blood 1818 are judged; 4941 and I will give 5414-1 thee blood 1818 in fury 2534 and jealousy. 7068

16:39 And I will also give 5414-1 thee into their hand, 3027 and they shall throw down 2040-1 thine eminent place, 1354 and shall break down 5422-14 thy high places: 7413 they shall strip 6584-52 thee also of thy clothes, 899 and shall take 3947-1 thy fair 8597 jewels, 3627 and leave 3240-52 thee naked 5903 and bare. 6181

16:40 They shall also bring up 5927-52 a company 6951 against thee, and they shall stone 7275-1 thee with stones, 68 and thrust thee through 1333-14 with their swords. 2719

16:41 And they shall burn 8313-1 thine houses 1004 with fire, 784 and execute 6213-1 judgments 8201 upon thee in the sight 5869 of many 7227 women: 802 and I will cause thee to cease 7673-52 from playing the harlot, 2181-6 and thou also shalt give 5414-4 no hire 868 any more.

16:42 So will I make my fury 2534 toward thee to rest, 5117-52 and my jealousy 7068 shall depart 5493-1 from thee, and I will be quiet, 8252-1 and will be no more angry. 3707-4

16:43 Because thou hast not remembered 2142-1 the days 3117 of thy youth, 5271 but hast fretted 7264-4 me in all these [things]; behold, 1887 therefore I also will recompense 5414-1 thy way 1870 upon [thine] head, 7218 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD: 3069 and thou shalt not commit 6213-1 this lewdness 2154 above all thine abominations. 8441

16:44 Behold, every one that useth proverbs 4911-6 shall use [this] proverb 4911-4 against thee, saying, 559-2 As [is] the mother, 517 [so is] her daughter. 1323

16:45 Thou [art] thy mother's 517 daughter, 1323 that lotheth 1602-6 her husband 376 and her children; 1121 and thou [art] the sister 269 of thy sisters, 269 which lothed 1602-1 their husbands 582 and their children: 1121 your mother 517 [was] an Hittite, 2850 and your father 1 an Amorite. 567

16:46 And thine elder 1419 sister 269 [is] Samaria, 8111 she and her daughters 1323 that dwell 3427-6 at thy left hand: 8040 and thy younger 6996 sister, 269 that dwelleth 3427-6 at thy right hand, 3225 [is] Sodom 5467 and her daughters. 1323

16:47 Yet hast thou not walked 1980-1 after their ways, 1870 nor done 6213-1 after their abominations: 8441 but, as [if that were] a very 6985|6962-1 little 4592 [thing], thou wast corrupted 7843-55 more than they 2004 in all thy ways. 1870

16:48 [As] I live, 2416 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 Sodom 5467 thy sister 269 hath not done, 6213-1 she nor her daughters, 1323 as thou hast done, 6213-1 thou and thy daughters. 1323

16:49 Behold, this was the iniquity 5771 of thy sister 269 Sodom, 5467 pride, 1347 fulness 7653 of bread, 3899 and abundance 7962 of idleness 8252-53 was in her and in her daughters, 1323 neither did she strengthen 2388-52 the hand 3027 of the poor 6041 and needy. 34

16:50 And they were haughty, 1361-4 and committed 6213-4 abomination 8441 before 6440 me: therefore I took them away 5493-55 as I saw 7200-1 [good].

16:51 Neither hath Samaria 8111 committed 2398-1 half 2677 of thy sins; 2403 but thou hast multiplied 7235-55 thine abominations 8441 more than they, 2007 and hast justified 6663-17 thy sisters 269 in all thine abominations 8441 which thou hast done. 6213-1

16:52 Thou also, which hast judged 6419-14 thy sisters, 269 bear 5375-3 thine own shame 3639 for thy sins 2403 that thou hast committed more abominable 8581-52 than they: 2004 they are more righteous 6663-4 than thou: yea, be thou confounded 954-3 also, and bear 5375-3 thy shame, 3639 in that thou hast justified 6663-15 thy sisters. 269

16:53 When I shall bring again 7725-1 their captivity, 7622|7622-k the captivity 7622|7622-k of Sodom 5467 and her daughters, 1323 and the captivity 7622|7622-q of Samaria 8111 and her daughters, 1323 then [will I bring again] the captivity 7622|7622-k of thy captives 7622 in the midst 8432 of them:

16:54 That thou mayest bear 5375-4 thine own shame, 3639 and mayest be confounded 3637-8 in all that thou hast done, 6213-1 in that thou art a comfort 5162-15 unto them.

16:55 When thy sisters, 269 Sodom 5467 and her daughters, 1323 shall return 7725-4 to their former estate, 6927 and Samaria 8111 and her daughters 1323 shall return 7725-4 to their former estate, 6927 then thou and thy daughters 1323 shall return 7725-4 to your former estate. 6927

16:56 For thy sister 269 Sodom 5467 was not mentioned 8052 by thy mouth 6310 in the day 3117 of thy pride, 1347

16:57 Before thy wickedness 7451 was discovered, 1540-11 as at the time 6256 of [thy] reproach 2781 of the daughters 1323 of Syria, 758 and all [that are] round about 5439 her, the daughters 1323 of the Philistines, 6430 which despise 7590-5 thee round about. 5439

16:58 Thou hast borne 5375-1 thy lewdness 2154 and thine abominations, 8441 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

16:59 For thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 I will even deal 6213-1 with thee as thou hast done, 6213-1 which hast despised 959-1 the oath 423 in breaking 6565-53 the covenant. 1285

16:60 Nevertheless I will remember 2142-1 my covenant 1285 with thee in the days 3117 of thy youth, 5271 and I will establish 6965-52 unto thee an everlasting 5769 covenant. 1285

16:61 Then thou shalt remember 2142-1 thy ways, 1870 and be ashamed, 3637-8 when thou shalt receive 3947-2 thy sisters, 269 thine elder 1419 and thy younger: 6996 and I will give 5414-1 them unto thee for daughters, 1323 but not by thy covenant. 1285

16:62 And I will establish 6965-52 my covenant 1285 with thee; and thou shalt know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD: 3068

16:63 That thou mayest remember, 2142-4 and be confounded, 954-1 and never open 6610 thy mouth 6310 any more because 6440 of thy shame, 3639 when I am pacified 3722-15 toward thee for all that thou hast done, 6213-1 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

17:1 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

17:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 put forth 2330-3 a riddle, 2420 and speak 4911-3 a parable 4912 unto the house 1004 of Israel; 3478

17:3 And say, 559-1 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 A great 1419 eagle 5404 with great 1419 wings, 3671 longwinged, 83 750 full 4392 of feathers, 5133 which had divers colours, 7553 came 935-1 unto Lebanon, 3844 and took 3947-4 the highest branch 6788 of the cedar: 730

17:4 He cropped off 6998-1 the top 7218 of his young twigs, 3242 and carried 935-55 it into a land 776 of traffick; 3667 he set 7760-1 it in a city 5892 of merchants. 7402-6

17:5 He took 3947-4 also of the seed 2233 of the land, 776 and planted 5414-4 it in a fruitful 2233 field; 7704 he placed 3947-1 [it] by great 7227 waters, 4325 [and] set 7760-1 it [as] a willow tree. 6851

17:6 And it grew, 6779-4 and became a spreading 5628-6 vine 1612 of low 8217 stature, 6967 whose branches 1808 turned 6437-2 toward him, and the roots 8328 thereof were under him: so it became a vine, 1612 and brought forth 6213-4 branches, 905 and shot forth 7971-17 sprigs. 6288

17:7 There was also another 259 great 1419 eagle 5404 with great 1419 wings 3671 and many 7227 feathers: 5133 and, behold, this vine 1612 did bend 3719-1 her roots 8328 toward him, and shot forth 7971-14 her branches 1808 toward him, that he might water 8248-53 it by the furrows 6170 of her plantation. 4302

17:8 It was planted 8362-7 in a good 2896 soil 7704 by great 7227 waters, 4325 that it might bring forth 6213-2 branches, 6057 and that it might bear 5375-2 fruit, 6529 that it might be a goodly 155 vine. 1612

17:9 Say 559-3 thou, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Shall it prosper? 6743-4 shall he not pull 5423-17 up the roots 8328 thereof, and cut off 7082-25 the fruit 6529 thereof, that it wither? 3001-1 it shall wither 3001-4 in all the leaves 2964 of her spring, 6780 even without great 1419 power 2220 or many 7227 people 5971 to pluck it up 5375-2 by the roots 8328 thereof.

17:10 Yea, behold, [being] planted, 8362-7 shall it prosper? 6743-4 shall it not utterly 3001-2 wither, 3001-4 when the east 6921 wind 7307 toucheth 5060-2 it? it shall wither 3001-4 in the furrows 6170 where it grew. 6780

17:11 Moreover the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

17:12 Say 559-3 now to the rebellious 4805 house, 1004 Know 3045-1 ye not what these [things mean]? tell 559-3 [them], Behold, the king 4428 of Babylon 894 is come 935-6 to Jerusalem, 3389 and hath taken 3947-4 the king 4428 thereof, and the princes 8269 thereof, and led 935-55 them with him to Babylon; 894

17:13 And hath taken 3947-4 of the king's 4410 seed, 2233 and made 3772-4 a covenant 1285 with him, and hath taken 935-55 an oath 423 of him: he hath also taken 3947-1 the mighty 352 of the land: 776

17:14 That the kingdom 4467 might be base, 8217 that it might not lift itself up, 5375-99 [but] that by keeping 8104-2 of his covenant 1285 it might stand. 5975-2

17:15 But he rebelled 4775-4 against him in sending 7971-2 his ambassadors 4397 into Egypt, 4714 that they might give 5414-2 him horses 5483 and much 7227 people. 5971 Shall he prosper? 6743-4 shall he escape 4422-11 that doeth 6213-6 such [things]? or shall he break 6565-52 the covenant, 1285 and be delivered? 4422-8

17:16 [As] I live, 2416 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 surely in the place 4725 [where] the king 4428 [dwelleth] that made him king, 4427-56 whose oath 423 he despised, 959-1 and whose covenant 1285 he brake, 6565-52 [even] with him in the midst 8432 of Babylon 894 he shall die. 4191-4

17:17 Neither shall Pharaoh 6547 with [his] mighty 1419 army 2428 and great 7227 company 6951 make 6213-4 for him in the war, 4421 by casting up 8210-2 mounts, 5550 and building 1129-2 forts, 1785 to cut off 3772-53 many 7227 persons: 5315

17:18 Seeing he despised 959-1 the oath 423 by breaking 6565-53 the covenant, 1285 when, lo, he had given 5414-1 his hand, 3027 and hath done 6213-1 all these [things], he shall not escape. 4422-11

17:19 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 [As] I live, 2416 surely mine oath 423 that he hath despised, 959-1 and my covenant 1285 that he hath broken, 6331-52 even it will I recompense 5414-1 upon his own head. 7218

17:20 And I will spread 6566-1 my net 7568 upon him, and he shall be taken 8610-8 in my snare, 4686 and I will bring 935-52 him to Babylon, 894 and will plead 8199-8 with him there for his trespass 4604 that he hath trespassed 4603-1 against me.

17:21 And all his fugitives 4015 with all his bands 102 shall fall 5307-4 by the sword, 2719 and they that remain 7604-12 shall be scattered 6566-11 toward all winds: 7307 and ye shall know 3045-1 that I the LORD 3068 have spoken 1696-14 [it].

17:22 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 I will also take 3947-1 of the highest branch 6788 of the high 7311-6 cedar, 730 and will set 5414-1 [it]; I will crop off 6998-4 from the top 7218 of his young twigs 3127 a tender one, 7390 and will plant 8362-1 [it] upon an high 1364 mountain 2022 and eminent: 8524-7

17:23 In the mountain 2022 of the height 4791 of Israel 3478 will I plant 8362-4 it: and it shall bring forth 5375-1 boughs, 6057 and bear 6213-1 fruit, 6529 and be a goodly 117 cedar: 730 and under it shall dwell 7931-1 all fowl 6833 of every wing; 3671 in the shadow 6738 of the branches 1808 thereof shall they dwell. 7931-4

17:24 And all the trees 6086 of the field 7704 shall know 3045-1 that I the LORD 3068 have brought down 8213-52 the high 1364 tree, 6086 have exalted 1361-52 the low 8217 tree, 6086 have dried up 3001-52 the green 3892 tree, 6086 and have made the dry 3002 tree 6086 to flourish: 6524-52 I the LORD 3068 have spoken 1696-14 and have done 6213-1 [it].

18:1 The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me again, saying, 559-2

18:2 What mean ye, that ye use 4911-6 this proverb 4912 concerning the land 127 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 The fathers 1 have eaten 398-4 sour grapes, 1155 and the children's 1121 teeth 8127 are set on edge? 6949-4

18:3 [As] I live, 2416 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 ye shall not have [occasion] any more to use 4911-2 this proverb 4912 in Israel. 3478

18:4 Behold, all souls 5315 are mine; as the soul 5315 of the father, 1 so also the soul 5315 of the son 1121 is mine: the soul 5315 that sinneth, 2398-6 it shall die. 4191-4

18:5 But if a man 376 be just, 6662 and do 6213-1 that which is lawful 4941 and right, 6666

18:6 [And] hath not eaten 398-1 upon the mountains, 2022 neither hath lifted up 5375-1 his eyes 5869 to the idols 1544 of the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 neither hath defiled 2930-14 his neighbour's 7453 wife, 802 neither hath come near 7126-4 to a menstruous 5079 woman, 802

18:7 And hath not oppressed 3238-55 any, 376 [but] hath restored 7725-55 to the debtor 2326 his pledge, 2258 hath spoiled 1497-4 none by violence, 1500 hath given 5414-4 his bread 3899 to the hungry, 7457 and hath covered 3680-17 the naked 5903 with a garment; 899

18:8 He [that] hath not given 5414-4 forth upon usury, 5392 neither hath taken 3947-4 any increase, 8636 [that] hath withdrawn 7725-55 his hand 3027 from iniquity, 5766 hath executed 6213-4 true 571 judgment 4941 between man 376 and man, 376

18:9 Hath walked 1980-17 in my statutes, 2708 and hath kept 8104-1 my judgments, 4941 to deal 6213-2 truly; 571 he [is] just, 6662 he shall surely 2421-2 live, 2421-4 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

18:10 If he beget 3205-52 a son 1121 [that is] a robber, 6530 a shedder 8210-6 of blood, 1818 and [that] doeth 6213-1 the like 251 to [any] one 259 of these [things],

18:11 And that doeth 6213-1 not any of those [duties], but even hath eaten 398-1 upon the mountains, 2022 and defiled 2930-14 his neighbour's 7453 wife, 802

18:12 Hath oppressed 3238-52 the poor 6041 and needy, 34 hath spoiled 1497-1 by violence, 1500 hath not restored 7725-55 the pledge, 2258 and hath lifted up 5375-1 his eyes 5869 to the idols, 1544 hath committed 6213-1 abomination, 8441

18:13 Hath given 5414-1 forth upon usury, 5392 and hath taken 3947-1 increase: 8636 shall he then live? 2425-1 he shall not live: 2421-4 he hath done 6213-1 all these abominations; 8441 he shall surely 4191-2 die; 4191-93 his blood 1818 shall be upon him.

18:14 Now, lo, [if] he beget 3205-52 a son, 1121 that seeth 7200-4 all his father's 1 sins 2403 which he hath done, 6213-1 and considereth, 7200-4 and doeth 6213-4 not such like, 2004

18:15 [That] hath not eaten 398-1 upon the mountains, 2022 neither hath lifted up 5375-1 his eyes 5869 to the idols 1544 of the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 hath not defiled 2930-14 his neighbour's 7453 wife, 802

18:16 Neither hath oppressed 3238-52 any, 376 hath not withholden 2254-1 the pledge, 2258 neither hath spoiled 1497-1 by violence, 1500 [but] hath given 5414-1 his bread 3899 to the hungry, 7457 and hath covered 3680-14 the naked 5903 with a garment, 899

18:17 [That] hath taken off 7725-52 his hand 3027 from the poor, 6041 [that] hath not received 3947-1 usury 5392 nor increase, 8636 hath executed 6213-1 my judgments, 4941 hath walked 1980-1 in my statutes; 2708 he shall not die 4191-4 for the iniquity 5771 of his father, 1 he shall surely 2421-2 live. 2421-4

18:18 [As for] his father, 1 because he cruelly 6233 oppressed, 6231-1 spoiled 1497-1 his brother 251 by violence, 1499 and did 6213-1 [that] which [is] not good 2896 among 8432 his people, 5971 lo, even he shall die 4191-5 in his iniquity. 5771

18:19 Yet say 559-1 ye, Why? doth not the son 1121 bear 5375-1 the iniquity 5771 of the father? 1 When the son 1121 hath done 6213-1 that which is lawful 4941 and right, 6666 [and] hath kept 8104-1 all my statutes, 2708 and hath done 6213-4 them, he shall surely 2421-2 live. 2421-4

18:20 The soul 5315 that sinneth, 2398-6 it shall die. 4191-4 The son 1121 shall not bear 5375-4 the iniquity 5771 of the father, 1 neither shall the father 1 bear 5375-4 the iniquity 5771 of the son: 1121 the righteousness 6666 of the righteous 6662 shall be upon him, and the wickedness 7564 of the wicked 7563 shall be upon him.

18:21 But if the wicked 7563 will turn 7725-4 from all his sins 2403 that he hath committed, 6213-1 and keep 8104-1 all my statutes, 2708 and do 6213-1 that which is lawful 4941 and right, 6666 he shall surely 2421-2 live, 2421-4 he shall not die. 4191-4

18:22 All his transgressions 6588 that he hath committed, 6213-1 they shall not be mentioned 2142-11 unto him: in his righteousness 6666 that he hath done 6213-1 he shall live. 2421-4

18:23 Have I any pleasure 2654-4 at all 2654-2 that the wicked 7563 should die? 4194 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD: 3069 [and] not that he should return 7725-2 from his ways, 1870 and live? 2421-1

18:24 But when the righteous 6662 turneth away 7725-2 from his righteousness, 6666 and committeth 6213-1 iniquity, 5766 [and] doeth 6213-4 according to all the abominations 8441 that the wicked 7563 [man] doeth, 6213-1 shall he live? 2425-1 All his righteousness 6666 that he hath done 6213-1 shall not be mentioned: 2142-11 in his trespass 4604 that he hath trespassed, 4603-1 and in his sin 2403 that he hath sinned, 2398-1 in them shall he die. 4191-4

18:25 Yet ye say, 559-1 The way 1870 of the Lord 136 is not equal. 8505-11 Hear 8085-3 now, O house 1004 of Israel; 3478 Is not my way 1870 equal? 8505-11 are not your ways 1870 unequal? 8505-11

18:26 When a righteous 6662 [man] turneth away 7725-2 from his righteousness, 6666 and committeth 6213-1 iniquity, 5766 and dieth 4191-1 in them; for his iniquity 5766 that he hath done 6213-1 shall he die. 4191-4

18:27 Again, when the wicked 7563 [man] turneth away 7725-2 from his wickedness 7564 that he hath committed, 6213-1 and doeth 6213-4 that which is lawful 4941 and right, 6666 he shall save his soul 5315 alive. 2421-17

18:28 Because he considereth, 7200-4 and turneth away 7725-4 from all his transgressions 6588 that he hath committed, 6213-1 he shall surely 2421-2 live, 2421-4 he shall not die. 4191-4

18:29 Yet saith 559-1 the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 The way 1870 of the Lord 136 is not equal. 8505-11 O house 1004 of Israel, 3478 are not my ways 1870 equal? 8505-11 are not your ways 1870 unequal? 8505-11

18:30 Therefore I will judge 8199-4 you, O house 1004 of Israel, 3478 every one 376 according to his ways, 1870 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069 Repent, 7725-3 and turn 7725-54 [yourselves] from all your transgressions; 6588 so iniquity 5771 shall not be your ruin. 4383

18:31 Cast away 7993-54 from you all your transgressions, 6588 whereby ye have transgressed; 6586-1 and make 6213-3 you a new 2319 heart 3820 and a new 2319 spirit: 7307 for why will ye die, 4191-4 O house 1004 of Israel? 3478

18:32 For I have no pleasure 2654-4 in the death 4194 of him that dieth, 4191-5 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD: 3069 wherefore turn 7725-54 [yourselves], and live 2421-3 ye.

19:1 Moreover take thou up 5375-3 a lamentation 7015 for the princes 5387 of Israel, 3478

19:2 And say, 559-1 What [is] thy mother? 517 A lioness: 3833 she lay down 7257-1 among lions, 738 she nourished 7235-14 her whelps 1484 among 8432 young lions. 3715

19:3 And she brought up 5927-55 one 259 of her whelps: 1484 it became a young lion, 3715 and it learned 3925-4 to catch 2963-2 the prey; 2964 it devoured 398-1 men. 120

19:4 The nations 1471 also heard 8085-4 of him; he was taken 8610-8 in their pit, 7845 and they brought 935-55 him with chains 2397 unto the land 776 of Egypt. 4714

19:5 Now when she saw 7200-4 that she had waited, 3176-8 [and] her hope 8615 was lost, 6-1 then she took 3947-4 another 259 of her whelps, 1484 [and] made 7760-1 him a young lion. 3715

19:6 And he went up and down 1980-101 among 8432 the lions, 738 he became a young lion, 3715 and learned 3925-4 to catch 2963-2 the prey, 2964 [and] devoured 398-1 men. 120

19:7 And he knew 3045-4 their desolate palaces, 490 and he laid waste 2717-52 their cities; 5892 and the land 776 was desolate, 3456-4 and the fulness 4393 thereof, by the noise 6963 of his roaring. 7581

19:8 Then the nations 1471 set 5414-4 against him on every side 5439 from the provinces, 4082 and spread 6566-4 their net 7568 over him: he was taken 8610-8 in their pit. 7845

19:9 And they put 5414-4 him in ward 5474 in chains, 2397 and brought 935-55 him to the king 4428 of Babylon: 894 they brought 935-55 him into holds, 4685 that his voice 6963 should no more be heard 8085-11 upon the mountains 2022 of Israel. 3478

19:10 Thy mother 517 [is] like a vine 1612 in thy blood, 1818|1818-q planted 8362-7 by the waters: 4325 she was fruitful 6509-6 and full of branches 6058 by reason of many 7227 waters. 4325

19:11 And she had strong 5797 rods 4294 for the sceptres 7626 of them that bare rule, 4910-6 and her stature 6967 was exalted 1361-4 among the thick branches, 5688 and she appeared 7200-11 in her height 1363 with the multitude 7230 of her branches. 1808

19:12 But she was plucked up 5428-93 in fury, 2534 she was cast down 7993-90 to the ground, 776 and the east 6921 wind 7307 dried up 3001-52 her fruit: 6529 her strong 5797 rods 4294 were broken 6561-98 and withered; 3001-1 the fire 784 consumed 398-1 them.

19:13 And now she [is] planted 8362-7 in the wilderness, 4057 in a dry 6723 and thirsty 6772 ground. 776

19:14 And fire 784 is gone out 3318-4 of a rod 4294 of her branches, 905 [which] hath devoured 398-1 her fruit, 6529 so that she hath no strong 5797 rod 4294 [to be] a sceptre 7626 to rule. 4910-2 This [is] a lamentation, 7015 and shall be for a lamentation. 7015

20:1 And it came to pass in the seventh 7637 year, 8141 in the fifth 2549 [month], the tenth 6218 [day] of the month, 2320 [that] certain 582 of the elders 2205 of Israel 3478 came 935-1 to enquire 1875-2 of the LORD, 3068 and sat 3427-4 before 6440 me.

20:2 Then came the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 unto me, saying, 559-2

20:3 Son 1121 of man, 120 speak 1696-16 unto the elders 2205 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Are ye come 935-6 to enquire 1875-2 of me? [As] I live, 2416 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 I will not be enquired 1875-11 of by you.

20:4 Wilt thou judge 8199-4 them, son 1121 of man, 120 wilt thou judge 8199-4 [them]? cause them to know 3045-54 the abominations 8441 of their fathers: 1

20:5 And say 559-1 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 In the day 3117 when I chose 977-2 Israel, 3478 and lifted up 5375-4 mine hand 3027 unto the seed 2233 of the house 1004 of Jacob, 3290 and made myself known 3045-11 unto them in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 when I lifted up 5375-4 mine hand 3027 unto them, saying, 559-2 I [am] the LORD 3068 your God; 430

20:6 In the day 3117 [that] I lifted up 5375-1 mine hand 3027 unto them, to bring them forth 3318-53 of the land 776 of Egypt 4714 into a land 776 that I had espied 8446-1 for them, flowing 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey, 1706 which [is] the glory 6643 of all lands: 776

20:7 Then said 559-4 I unto them, Cast ye away 7993-54 every man 376 the abominations 8251 of his eyes, 5869 and defile 2930-101 not yourselves with the idols 1544 of Egypt: 4714 I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

20:8 But they rebelled 4784-55 against me, and would 14-1 not hearken 8085-2 unto me: they did not every man 376 cast away 7993-52 the abominations 8251 of their eyes, 5869 neither did they forsake 5800-1 the idols 1544 of Egypt: 4714 then I said, 559-4 I will pour out 8210-2 my fury 2534 upon them, to accomplish 3615-15 my anger 639 against them in the midst 8432 of the land 776 of Egypt. 4714

20:9 But I wrought 6213-4 for my name's 8034 sake, that it should not be polluted 2490-9 before 5869 the heathen, 1471 among 8432 whom they [were], in whose sight 5869 I made myself known 3045-8 unto them, in bringing them forth 3318-53 out of the land 776 of Egypt. 4714

20:10 Wherefore I caused them to go forth 3318-55 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 and brought 935-55 them into the wilderness. 4057

20:11 And I gave 5414-4 them my statutes, 2708 and shewed 3045-52 them my judgments, 4941 which [if] a man 120 do, 6213-4 he shall even live 2425-1 in them.

20:12 Moreover also I gave 5414-1 them my sabbaths, 7676 to be a sign 226 between me and them, that they might know 3045-2 that I [am] the LORD 3068 that sanctify 6942-18 them.

20:13 But the house 1004 of Israel 3478 rebelled 4784-55 against me in the wilderness: 4057 they walked 1980-1 not in my statutes, 2708 and they despised 3988-1 my judgments, 4941 which [if] a man 120 do, 6213-4 he shall even live 2425-1 in them; and my sabbaths 7676 they greatly 3966 polluted: 2490-14 then I said, 559-4 I would pour out 8210-2 my fury 2534 upon them in the wilderness, 4057 to consume 3615-15 them.

20:14 But I wrought 6213-4 for my name's 8034 sake, that it should not be polluted 2490-9 before 5869 the heathen, 1471 in whose sight 5869 I brought them out. 3318-52

20:15 Yet also I lifted up 5375-1 my hand 3027 unto them in the wilderness, 4057 that I would not bring 935-53 them into the land 776 which I had given 5414-1 [them], flowing 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey, 1706 which [is] the glory 6643 of all lands; 776

20:16 Because they despised 3988-1 my judgments, 4941 and walked 1980-1 not in my statutes, 2708 but polluted 2490-14 my sabbaths: 7676 for their heart 3820 went 1980-6 after 310 their idols. 1544

20:17 Nevertheless mine eye 5869 spared 2347-4 them from destroying 7843-15 them, neither did I make 6213-1 an end 3617 of them in the wilderness. 4057

20:18 But I said 559-4 unto their children 1121 in the wilderness, 4057 Walk 3212-4 ye not in the statutes 2706 of your fathers, 1 neither observe 8104-4 their judgments, 4941 nor defile 2930-101 yourselves with their idols: 1544

20:19 I [am] the LORD 3068 your God; 430 walk 3212-3 in my statutes, 2708 and keep 8104-3 my judgments, 4941 and do 6213-3 them;

20:20 And hallow 6942-16 my sabbaths; 7676 and they shall be a sign 226 between me and you, that ye may know 3045-2 that I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

20:21 Notwithstanding the children 1121 rebelled 4784-55 against me: they walked 1980-1 not in my statutes, 2708 neither kept 8104-1 my judgments 4941 to do 6213-2 them, which [if] a man 120 do, 6213-4 he shall even live 2425-1 in them; they polluted 2490-14 my sabbaths: 7676 then I said, 559-4 I would pour out 8210-2 my fury 2534 upon them, to accomplish 3615-15 my anger 639 against them in the wilderness. 4057

20:22 Nevertheless I withdrew 7725-52 mine hand, 3027 and wrought 6213-4 for my name's 8034 sake, that it should not be polluted 2490-9 in the sight 5869 of the heathen, 1471 in whose sight 5869 I brought them forth. 3318-52

20:23 I lifted up 5375-1 mine hand 3027 unto them also in the wilderness, 4057 that I would scatter 6327-53 them among the heathen, 1471 and disperse 2219-15 them through the countries; 776

20:24 Because they had not executed 6213-1 my judgments, 4941 but had despised 3988-1 my statutes, 2708 and had polluted 2490-14 my sabbaths, 7676 and their eyes 5869 were after 310 their fathers' 1 idols. 1544

20:25 Wherefore I gave 5414-1 them also statutes 2706 [that were] not good, 2896 and judgments 4941 whereby they should not live; 2421-4

20:26 And I polluted 2930-17 them in their own gifts, 4979 in that they caused to pass through 5674-53 [the fire] all that openeth 6363 the womb, 7356 that I might make them desolate, 8074-55 to the end that they might know 3045-4 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

20:27 Therefore, son 1121 of man, 120 speak 1696-16 unto the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Yet in this your fathers 1 have blasphemed 1442-14 me, in that they have committed 4603-2 a trespass 4604 against me.

20:28 [For] when I had brought 935-55 them into the land, 776 [for] the which I lifted up 5375-1 mine hand 3027 to give 5414-2 it to them, then they saw 7200-4 every high 7311-6 hill, 1389 and all the thick 5687 trees, 6086 and they offered 2076-4 there their sacrifices, 2077 and there they presented 5414-4 the provocation 3708 of their offering: 7133 there also they made 7760-4 their sweet 5207 savour, 7381 and poured out 5258-55 there their drink offerings. 5262

20:29 Then I said 559-4 unto them, What [is] the high place 1116 whereunto ye go? 935-6 And the name 8034 thereof is called 7121-11 Bamah 1117 unto this day. 3117

20:30 Wherefore say 559-3 unto the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Are ye polluted 2930-12 after the manner 1870 of your fathers? 1 and commit ye whoredom 2181-6 after 310 their abominations? 8251

20:31 For when ye offer 5375-2 your gifts, 4979 when ye make your sons 1121 to pass through 5674-53 the fire, 784 ye pollute 2930-12 yourselves with all your idols, 1544 even unto this day: 3117 and shall I be enquired 1875-11 of by you, O house 1004 of Israel? 3478 [As] I live, 2416 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 I will not be enquired 1875-11 of by you.

20:32 And that which cometh 5927-6 into your mind 7307 shall not be at all, that ye say, 559-6 We will be 1961-4 as the heathen, 1471 as the families 4940 of the countries, 776 to serve 8334-15 wood 6086 and stone. 68

20:33 [As] I live, 2416 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 surely with a mighty 2389 hand, 3027 and with a stretched out 5186-7 arm, 2220 and with fury 2534 poured out, 8210-7 will I rule 4427-4 over you:

20:34 And I will bring you out 3318-52 from the people, 5971 and will gather 6908-14 you out of the countries 776 wherein ye are scattered, 6327-8 with a mighty 2389 hand, 3027 and with a stretched out 5186-7 arm, 2220 and with fury 2534 poured out. 8210-7

20:35 And I will bring 935-52 you into the wilderness 4057 of the people, 5971 and there will I plead 8199-8 with you face 6440 to face. 6440

20:36 Like as I pleaded 8199-8 with your fathers 1 in the wilderness 4057 of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 so will I plead 8199-11 with you, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

20:37 And I will cause you to pass 5674-52 under the rod, 7626 and I will bring 935-52 you into the bond 4562 of the covenant: 1285

20:38 And I will purge out 1305-1 from among you the rebels, 4775-6 and them that transgress 6586-6 against me: I will bring them forth 3318-55 out of the country 776 where they sojourn, 4033 and they shall not enter 935-4 into the land 127 of Israel: 3478 and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

20:39 As for you, O house 1004 of Israel, 3478 thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Go 3212-3 ye, serve 5647-3 ye every one 376 his idols, 1544 and hereafter 310 [also], if ye will not hearken 8085-6 unto me: but pollute 2490-17 ye my holy 6944 name 8034 no more with your gifts, 4979 and with your idols. 1544

20:40 For in mine holy 6944 mountain, 2022 in the mountain 2022 of the height 4791 of Israel, 3478 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 there shall all the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 all of them in the land, 776 serve 5647-4 me: there will I accept 7521-4 them, and there will I require 1875-4 your offerings, 8641 and the firstfruits 7225 of your oblations, 4864 with all your holy things. 6944

20:41 I will accept 7521-4 you with your sweet 5207 savour, 7381 when I bring you out 3318-53 from the people, 5971 and gather 6908-14 you out of the countries 776 wherein ye have been scattered; 6327-8 and I will be sanctified 6942-8 in you before 5869 the heathen. 1471

20:42 And ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 when I shall bring 935-53 you into the land 127 of Israel, 3478 into the country 776 [for] the which I lifted up 5375-1 mine hand 3027 to give 5414-2 it to your fathers. 1

20:43 And there shall ye remember 2142-1 your ways, 1870 and all your doings, 5949 wherein ye have been defiled; 2930-8 and ye shall lothe 6962-8 yourselves in your own sight 6440 for all your evils 7451 that ye have committed. 6213-1

20:44 And ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 when I have wrought 6213-2 with you for my name's 8034 sake, not according to your wicked 7451 ways, 1870 nor according to your corrupt 7843-12 doings, 5949 O ye house 1004 of Israel, 3478 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

20:45 Moreover the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

20:46 Son 1121 of man, 120 set 7760-3 thy face 6440 toward 1870 the south, 8486 and drop 5197-54 [thy word] toward the south, 1864 and prophesy 5012-10 against the forest 3293 of the south 5045 field; 7704

20:47 And say 559-1 to the forest 3293 of the south, 5045 Hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD; 3068 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I will kindle 3341-56 a fire 784 in thee, and it shall devour 398-1 every green 3892 tree 6086 in thee, and every dry 3002 tree: 6086 the flaming 3852 flame 7957 shall not be quenched, 3518-4 and all faces 6440 from the south 5045 to the north 6828 shall be burned 6866-8 therein.

20:48 And all flesh 1320 shall see 7200-1 that I the LORD 3068 have kindled 1197-14 it: it shall not be quenched. 3518-4

20:49 Then said 559-4 I, Ah 162 Lord 136 GOD! 3069 they say 559-6 of me, Doth he not speak 4911-18 parables? 4912

21:1 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

21:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 set 7760-3 thy face 6440 toward Jerusalem, 3389 and drop 5197-54 [thy word] toward the holy places, 4720 and prophesy 5012-10 against the land 127 of Israel, 3478

21:3 And say 559-1 to the land 127 of Israel, 3478 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Behold, I [am] against thee, and will draw forth 3318-52 my sword 2719 out of his sheath, 8593 and will cut off 3772-52 from thee the righteous 6662 and the wicked. 7563

21:4 Seeing then 3282 that I will cut off 3772-52 from thee the righteous 6662 and the wicked, 7563 therefore shall my sword 2719 go forth 3318-4 out of his sheath 8593 against all flesh 1320 from the south 5045 to the north: 6828

21:5 That all flesh 1320 may know 3045-1 that I the LORD 3068 have drawn forth 3318-52 my sword 2719 out of his sheath: 8593 it shall not return 7725-4 any more.

21:6 Sigh 584-10 therefore, thou son 1121 of man, 120 with the breaking 7670 of [thy] loins; 4975 and with bitterness 4814 sigh 584-11 before their eyes. 5869

21:7 And it shall be, when they say 559-4 unto thee, Wherefore sighest 584-12 thou? that thou shalt answer, 559-1 For the tidings; 8052 because it cometh: 935-6 and every heart 3820 shall melt, 4549-8 and all hands 3027 shall be feeble, 7503-1 and every spirit 7307 shall faint, 3543-14 and all knees 1290 shall be weak 3212-4 [as] water: 4325 behold, it cometh, 935-6 and shall be brought to pass, 1961-8 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

21:8 Again the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

21:9 Son 1121 of man, 120 prophesy, 5012-10 and say, 559-1 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 Say, 559-3 A sword, 2719 a sword 2719 is sharpened, 2300-90 and also furbished: 4803-7

21:10 It is sharpened 2300-90 to make a sore 2874 slaughter; 2873-2 it is furbished 4803-30 that it may glitter: 1300 should we then 176 make mirth? 7797-4 it contemneth 3988-6 the rod 7626 of my son, 1121 [as] every tree. 6086

21:11 And he hath given 5414-4 it to be furbished, 4803-2 that it may be handled: 3709 8610-2 this sword 2719 is sharpened, 2300-90 and it is furbished, 4803-30 to give 5414-2 it into the hand 3027 of the slayer. 2026-6

21:12 Cry 2199-3 and howl, 3213-54 son 1121 of man: 120 for it shall be upon my people, 5971 it [shall be] upon all the princes 5387 of Israel: 3478 terrors 4048-7 by reason of 413 the sword 2719 shall be upon my people: 5971 smite 5606-3 therefore upon [thy] thigh. 3409

21:13 Because [it is] a trial, 974-27 and what if [the sword] contemn 3988-6 even the rod? 7626 it shall be no [more], saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

21:14 Thou therefore, son 1121 of man, 120 prophesy, 5012-10 and smite 5221-54 [thine] hands 3709 together, 3709 and let the sword 2719 be doubled 3717-11 the third 7992 time, the sword 2719 of the slain: 2491 it [is] the sword 2719 of the great 1419 [men that are] slain, 2491 which entereth into their privy chambers. 2314-6

21:15 I have set 5414-1 the point 19 of the sword 2719 against all their gates, 8179 that [their] heart 3820 may faint, 4127-2 and [their] ruins 4383 be multiplied: 7235-53 ah! 253 [it is] made 6213-7 bright, 1300 [it is] wrapped up 4593 for the slaughter. 2874

21:16 Go thee one way or other, 258-100 [either] on 7760-54 the right hand, 3231-54 [or] on the left, 8041-54 whithersoever 575 thy face 6440 [is] set. 3259-94

21:17 I will also smite 5221-55 mine hands 3709 together, 3709 and I will cause my fury 2534 to rest: 5117-52 I the LORD 3068 have said 1696-14 [it].

21:18 The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me again, saying, 559-2

21:19 Also, thou son 1121 of man, 120 appoint 7760-3 thee two 8147 ways, 1870 that the sword 2719 of the king 4428 of Babylon 894 may come: 935-2 both twain 8147 shall come forth 3318-4 out of one 259 land: 776 and choose 1254-16 thou a place, 3027 choose 1254-16 [it] at the head 7218 of the way 1870 to the city. 5892

21:20 Appoint 7760-4 a way, 1870 that the sword 2719 may come 935-2 to Rabbath 7237 of the Ammonites, 1121 5983 and to Judah 3063 in Jerusalem 3389 the defenced. 1219-7

21:21 For the king 4428 of Babylon 894 stood 5975-1 at the parting 517 of the way, 1870 at the head 7218 of the two 8147 ways, 1870 to use 7080-2 divination: 7081 he made [his] arrows 2671 bright, 7043-43 he consulted 7592-1 with images, 8655 he looked 7200-1 in the liver. 3516

21:22 At his right hand 3225 was the divination 7081 for Jerusalem, 3389 to appoint 7760-2 captains, 3733 to open 6605-2 the mouth 6310 in the slaughter, 7524 to lift up 7311-53 the voice 6963 with shouting, 8643 to appoint 7760-2 [battering] rams 3733 against the gates, 8179 to cast 8210-2 a mount, 5550 [and] to build 1129-2 a fort. 1785

21:23 And it shall be unto them as a false 7723 divination 7080-2 in their sight, 5869 to them that have sworn 7650-7 oaths: 7621 but he will call to remembrance 2142-56 the iniquity, 5771 that they may be taken. 8610-9

21:24 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Because ye have made your iniquity 5771 to be remembered, 2142-53 in that your transgressions 6588 are discovered, 1540-9 so that in all your doings 5949 your sins 2403 do appear; 7200-9 because, [I say], that ye are come to remembrance, 2142-9 ye shall be taken 8610-11 with the hand. 3709

21:25 And thou, profane 2491 wicked 7563 prince 5387 of Israel, 3478 whose day 3117 is come, 935-1 when 6256 iniquity 5771 [shall have] an end, 7093

21:26 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Remove 5493-54 the diadem, 4701 and take off 7311-54 the crown: 5850 this 2063 [shall] not [be] the same: 2063 exalt 1361-53 [him that is] low, 8217 and abase 8213-53 [him that is] high. 1364

21:27 I will overturn, 7760-4 5754 overturn, 5754 overturn, 5754 it: and it shall be 1961 no 3808 [more], until he come 935-2 whose right 4941 it is; and I will give 5414-1 it [him].

21:28 And thou, son 1121 of man, 120 prophesy 5012-10 and say, 559-1 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD 3069 concerning the Ammonites, 1121 5983 and concerning their reproach; 2781 even say 559-1 thou, The sword, 2719 the sword 2719 [is] drawn: 6605-7 for the slaughter 2874 [it is] furbished, 4803-7 to consume 398-53 because of the glittering: 1300

21:29 Whiles they see 2372-2 vanity 7723 unto thee, whiles they divine 7080-2 a lie 3577 unto thee, to bring 5414-2 thee upon the necks 6677 of [them that are] slain, 2491 of the wicked, 7563 whose day 3117 is come, 935-1 when 6256 their iniquity 5771 [shall have] an end. 7093

21:30 Shall I cause [it] to return 7725-54 into his sheath? 8593 I will judge 8199-4 thee in the place 4725 where thou wast created, 1254-8 in the land 776 of thy nativity. 4351

21:31 And I will pour out 8210-1 mine indignation 2195 upon thee, I will blow 6315-55 against thee in the fire 784 of my wrath, 5678 and deliver 5414-1 thee into the hand 3027 of brutish 1197-6 men, 582 [and] skilful 2796 to destroy. 4889

21:32 Thou shalt be for fuel 402 to the fire; 784 thy blood 1818 shall be in the midst 8432 of the land; 776 thou shalt be no [more] remembered: 2142-11 for I the LORD 3068 have spoken 1696-14 [it].

22:1 Moreover the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

22:2 Now, thou son 1121 of man, 120 wilt thou judge, 8199-4 wilt thou judge 8199-4 the bloody 1818 city? 5892 yea, thou shalt shew 3045-52 her all her abominations. 8441

22:3 Then say 559-1 thou, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 The city 5892 sheddeth 8210-6 blood 1818 in the midst 8432 of it, that her time 6256 may come, 935-2 and maketh 6213-1 idols 1544 against herself to defile 2930-2 herself.

22:4 Thou art become guilty 816-1 in thy blood 1818 that thou hast shed; 8210-1 and hast defiled 2930-1 thyself in thine idols 1544 which thou hast made; 6213-1 and thou hast caused thy days 3117 to draw near, 7126-55 and art come 935-4 [even] unto thy years: 8141 therefore have I made 5414-1 thee a reproach 2781 unto the heathen, 1471 and a mocking 7048 to all countries. 776

22:5 [Those that be] near, 7138 and [those that be] far 7350 from thee, shall mock 7046-101 thee, [which art] infamous 2931 8034 [and] much 7227 vexed. 4103

22:6 Behold, the princes 5387 of Israel, 3478 every one 376 were in thee to their power 2220 to shed 8210-2 blood. 1818

22:7 In thee have they set light 7043-52 by father 1 and mother: 517 in the midst 8432 of thee have they dealt 6213-1 by oppression 6233 with the stranger: 1616 in thee have they vexed 3238-52 the fatherless 3490 and the widow. 490

22:8 Thou hast despised 959-1 mine holy things, 6944 and hast profaned 2490-14 my sabbaths. 7676

22:9 In thee are men 582 that carry tales 7400 to shed 8210-2 blood: 1818 and in thee they eat 398-1 upon the mountains: 2022 in the midst 8432 of thee they commit 6213-1 lewdness. 2154

22:10 In thee have they discovered 1540-14 their fathers' 1 nakedness: 6172 in thee have they humbled 6031-14 her that was set apart 5079 for pollution. 2931

22:11 And one 376 hath committed 6213-1 abomination 8441 with his neighbour's 7453 wife; 802 and another 376 hath lewdly 2154 defiled 2930-14 his daughter in law; 3618 and another 376 in thee hath humbled 6031-14 his sister, 269 his father's 1 daughter. 1323

22:12 In thee have they taken 3947-1 gifts 7810 to shed 8210-2 blood; 1818 thou hast taken 3947-1 usury 5392 and increase, 8636 and thou hast greedily gained 1214-17 of thy neighbours 7453 by extortion, 6233 and hast forgotten 7911-1 me, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

22:13 Behold, therefore I have smitten 5221-52 mine hand 3709 at thy dishonest gain 1215 which thou hast made, 6213-1 and at thy blood 1818 which hath been in the midst 8432 of thee.

22:14 Can thine heart 3820 endure, 5975-4 or can thine hands 3027 be strong, 2388-4 in the days 3117 that I shall deal 6213-6 with thee? I the LORD 3068 have spoken 1696-14 [it], and will do 6213-1 [it].

22:15 And I will scatter 6327-52 thee among the heathen, 1471 and disperse 2219-14 thee in the countries, 776 and will consume 8552-52 thy filthiness 2932 out of thee.

22:16 And thou shalt take thine inheritance 2490-8|5157-14-k in thyself in the sight 5869 of the heathen, 1471 and thou shalt know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

22:17 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

22:18 Son 1121 of man, 120 the house 1004 of Israel 3478 is to me become dross: 5509 all they [are] brass, 5178 and tin, 913 and iron, 1270 and lead, 5777 in the midst 8432 of the furnace; 3564 they are [even] the dross 5509 of silver. 3701

22:19 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Because ye are all become dross, 5509 behold, therefore I will gather 6908-6 you into the midst 8432 of Jerusalem. 3389

22:20 [As] they gather 6910 silver, 3701 and brass, 5178 and iron, 1270 and lead, 5777 and tin, 913 into the midst 8432 of the furnace, 3564 to blow 5301-2 the fire 784 upon it, to melt 5413-53 [it]; so will I gather 6908-4 [you] in mine anger 639 and in my fury, 2534 and I will leave 3240-52 [you there], and melt 5413-52 you.

22:21 Yea, I will gather 3664-14 you, and blow 5301-1 upon you in the fire 784 of my wrath, 5678 and ye shall be melted 5413-8 in the midst 8432 thereof.

22:22 As silver 3701 is melted 2046 in the midst 8432 of the furnace, 3564 so shall ye be melted 5413-93 in the midst 8432 thereof; and ye shall know 3045-1 that I the LORD 3068 have poured out 8210-1 my fury 2534 upon you.

22:23 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

22:24 Son 1121 of man, 120 say 559-3 unto her, Thou [art] the land 776 that is not cleansed, 2891-30 nor rained 1656 upon in the day 3117 of indignation. 2195

22:25 [There is] a conspiracy 7195 of her prophets 5030 in the midst 8432 thereof, like a roaring 7580-6 lion 738 ravening 2963-6 the prey; 2964 they have devoured 398-1 souls; 5315 they have taken 3947-4 the treasure 2633 and precious things; 3366 they have made her many 7235-52 widows 490 in the midst 8432 thereof.

22:26 Her priests 3548 have violated 2554-1 my law, 8451 and have profaned 2490-17 mine holy things: 6944 they have put no difference 914-52 between the holy 6944 and profane, 2455 neither have they shewed 3045-52 [difference] between the unclean 2931 and the clean, 2889 and have hid 5956-52 their eyes 5869 from my sabbaths, 7676 and I am profaned 2490-11 among 8432 them.

22:27 Her princes 8269 in the midst 7130 thereof [are] like wolves 2061 ravening 2963-6 the prey, 2964 to shed 8210-2 blood, 1818 [and] to destroy 6-15 souls, 5315 to get 1214-2 dishonest gain. 1215

22:28 And her prophets 5030 have daubed 2902-1 them with untempered 8602 [morter], seeing 2374 vanity, 7723 and divining 7080-6 lies 3577 unto them, saying, 559-6 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 when the LORD 3068 hath not spoken. 1696-14

22:29 The people 5971 of the land 776 have used 6231-1 oppression, 6233 and exercised 1497-1 robbery, 1498 and have vexed 3238-52 the poor 6041 and needy: 34 yea, they have oppressed 6231-1 the stranger 1616 wrongfully. 1097 4941

22:30 And I sought 1245-17 for a man 376 among them, that should make up 1443-6 the hedge, 1447 and stand 5975-6 in the gap 6556 before 6440 me for the land, 776 that I should not destroy 7843-15 it: but I found 4672-1 none.

22:31 Therefore have I poured out 8210-4 mine indignation 2195 upon them; I have consumed 3615-14 them with the fire 784 of my wrath: 5678 their own way 1870 have I recompensed 5414-1 upon their heads, 7218 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

23:1 The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came again unto me, saying, 559-2

23:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 there were two 8147 women, 802 the daughters 1323 of one 259 mother: 517

23:3 And they committed whoredoms 2181-4 in Egypt; 4714 they committed whoredoms 2181-1 in their youth: 5271 there were their breasts 7699 pressed, 4600-27 and there they bruised 6213-14 the teats 1717 of their virginity. 1331

23:4 And the names 8034 of them [were] Aholah 170 the elder, 1419 and Aholibah 172 her sister: 269 and they were mine, and they bare 3205-4 sons 1121 and daughters. 1323 Thus [were] their names; 8034 Samaria 8111 [is] Aholah, 170 and Jerusalem 3389 Aholibah. 172

23:5 And Aholah 170 played the harlot 2181-4 when she was mine; 8478 and she doted 5689-4 on her lovers, 157-18 on the Assyrians 804 [her] neighbours, 7138

23:6 [Which were] clothed 3847-7 with blue, 8504 captains 6346 and rulers, 5461 all of them desirable 2531 young men, 970 horsemen 6571 riding 7392-6 upon horses. 5483

23:7 Thus she committed 5414-4 her whoredoms 8457 with them, with all them [that were] the chosen 4005 men 1121 of Assyria, 804 and with all on whom she doted: 5689-1 with all their idols 1544 she defiled 2930-8 herself.

23:8 Neither left 5800-1 she her whoredoms 8457 [brought] from Egypt: 4714 for in her youth 5271 they lay 7901-1 with her, and they bruised 6213-14 the breasts 1717 of her virginity, 1331 and poured 8210-4 their whoredom 8457 upon her.

23:9 Wherefore I have delivered 5414-1 her into the hand 3027 of her lovers, 157-18 into the hand 3027 of the Assyrians, 1121 804 upon whom she doted. 5689-1

23:10 These discovered 1540-14 her nakedness: 6172 they took 3947-1 her sons 1121 and her daughters, 1323 and slew 2026-1 her with the sword: 2719 and she became famous 8034 among women; 802 for they had executed 6213-1 judgment 8196 upon her.

23:11 And when her sister 269 Aholibah 172 saw 7200-4 [this], she was more corrupt 7843-55 in her inordinate love 5691 than she, and in her whoredoms 8457 more than her sister 269 in [her] whoredoms. 2183

23:12 She doted 5689-1 upon the Assyrians 1121 804 [her] neighbours, 7138 captains 6346 and rulers 5461 clothed 3847-7 most gorgeously, 4358 horsemen 6571 riding 7392-6 upon horses, 5483 all of them desirable 2531 young men. 970

23:13 Then I saw 7200-4 that she was defiled, 2930-8 [that] they [took] both 8147 one 259 way, 1870

23:14 And [that] she increased 3254-55 her whoredoms: 8457 for when she saw 7200-4 men 582 pourtrayed 2707-30 upon the wall, 7023 the images 6754 of the Chaldeans 3778 pourtrayed 2710-7 with vermilion, 8350

23:15 Girded 2289 with girdles 232 upon their loins, 4975 exceeding 5628-7 in dyed attire 2871 upon their heads, 7218 all of them princes 7991 to look to, 4758 after the manner 1823 of the Babylonians 1121 894 of Chaldea, 3778 the land 776 of their nativity: 4138

23:16 And as soon as she saw 4758 them with her eyes, 5869 she doted 5689-4 upon them, and sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 unto them into Chaldea. 3778

23:17 And the Babylonians 1121 894 came 935-4 to her into the bed 4904 of love, 1730 and they defiled 2930-17 her with their whoredom, 8457 and she was polluted 2930-4 with them, and her mind 5315 was alienated 3363-4 from them.

23:18 So she discovered 1540-17 her whoredoms, 8457 and discovered 1540-17 her nakedness: 6172 then my mind 5315 was alienated 3363-4 from her, like as my mind 5315 was alienated 5361-1 from her sister. 269

23:19 Yet she multiplied 7235-55 her whoredoms, 8457 in calling to remembrance 2142-2 the days 3117 of her youth, 5271 wherein she had played the harlot 2181-1 in the land 776 of Egypt. 4714

23:20 For she doted 5689-4 upon their paramours, 6370 whose flesh 1320 [is as] the flesh 1320 of asses, 2543 and whose issue 2231 [is like] the issue 2231 of horses. 5483

23:21 Thus thou calledst to remembrance 6485-4 the lewdness 2154 of thy youth, 5271 in bruising 6213-2 thy teats 1717 by the Egyptians 4714 for the paps 7699 of thy youth. 5271

23:22 Therefore, O Aholibah, 172 thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I will raise up 5782-56 thy lovers 157-18 against thee, from whom thy mind 5315 is alienated, 5361-1 and I will bring 935-52 them against thee on every side; 5439

23:23 The Babylonians, 1121 894 and all the Chaldeans, 3778 Pekod, 6489 and Shoa, 7772 and Koa, 6970 [and] all the Assyrians 1121 804 with them: all of them desirable 2531 young men, 970 captains 6346 and rulers, 5461 great lords 7991 and renowned, 7121-7 all of them riding 7392-6 upon horses. 5483

23:24 And they shall come 935-1 against thee with chariots, 2021 wagons, 7393 and wheels, 1534 and with an assembly 6951 of people, 5971 [which] shall set 7760-4 against thee buckler 6793 and shield 4043 and helmet 6959 round about: 5439 and I will set 5414-1 judgment 4941 before 6440 them, and they shall judge 8199-1 thee according to their judgments. 4941

23:25 And I will set 5414-1 my jealousy 7068 against thee, and they shall deal 6213-1 furiously 2534 with thee: they shall take away 5493-55 thy nose 639 and thine ears; 241 and thy remnant 319 shall fall 5307-4 by the sword: 2719 they shall take 3947-4 thy sons 1121 and thy daughters; 1323 and thy residue 319 shall be devoured 398-11 by the fire. 784

23:26 They shall also strip 6584-52 thee out of thy clothes, 899 and take away 3947-1 thy fair 8597 jewels. 3627

23:27 Thus will I make thy lewdness 2154 to cease 7673-52 from thee, and thy whoredom 2184 [brought] from the land 776 of Egypt: 4714 so that thou shalt not lift up 5375-4 thine eyes 5869 unto them, nor remember 2142-4 Egypt 4714 any more.

23:28 For thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I will deliver 5414-6 thee into the hand 3027 [of them] whom thou hatest, 8130-1 into the hand 3027 [of them] from whom thy mind 5315 is alienated: 5361-1

23:29 And they shall deal 6213-1 with thee hatefully, 8135 and shall take away 3947-1 all thy labour, 3018 and shall leave 5800-1 thee naked 5903 and bare: 6181 and the nakedness 6172 of thy whoredoms 2183 shall be discovered, 1540-8 both thy lewdness 2154 and thy whoredoms. 8457

23:30 I will do 6213-2 these [things] unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring 2181-2 after 310 the heathen, 1471 [and] because thou art polluted 2930-8 with their idols. 1544

23:31 Thou hast walked 1980-1 in the way 1870 of thy sister; 269 therefore will I give 5414-1 her cup 3563 into thine hand. 3027

23:32 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Thou shalt drink 8354-4 of thy sister's 269 cup 3563 deep 6013 and large: 7342 thou shalt be laughed to scorn 6712 and had in derision; 3933 it containeth 3557-53 much. 4767

23:33 Thou shalt be filled 4390-11 with drunkenness 7943 and sorrow, 3015 with the cup 3563 of astonishment 8047 and desolation, 8077 with the cup 3563 of thy sister 269 Samaria. 8111

23:34 Thou shalt even drink 8354-1 it and suck [it] out, 4680-1 and thou shalt break 1633-17 the sherds 2789 thereof, and pluck off 5423-17 thine own breasts: 7699 for I have spoken 1696-14 [it], saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

23:35 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Because thou hast forgotten 7911-1 me, and cast 7993-55 me behind 310 thy back, 1458 therefore bear 5375-3 thou also thy lewdness 2154 and thy whoredoms. 8457

23:36 The LORD 3068 said 559-4 moreover unto me; Son 1121 of man, 120 wilt thou judge 8199-4 Aholah 170 and Aholibah? 172 yea, declare 5046-54 unto them their abominations; 8441

23:37 That they have committed adultery, 5003-14 and blood 1818 [is] in their hands, 3027 and with their idols 1544 have they committed adultery, 5003-14 and have also caused their sons, 1121 whom they bare 3205-1 unto me, to pass for them through 5674-52 [the fire], to devour 402 [them].

23:38 Moreover this they have done 6213-1 unto me: they have defiled 2930-14 my sanctuary 4720 in the same day, 3117 and have profaned 2490-14 my sabbaths. 7676

23:39 For when they had slain 7819-2 their children 1121 to their idols, 1544 then they came 935-4 the same day 3117 into my sanctuary 4720 to profane 2490-15 it; and, lo, thus have they done 6213-1 in the midst 8432 of mine house. 1004

23:40 And furthermore, 637 that ye have sent 7971-4 for men 582 to come 935-6 from far, 4801 unto whom a messenger 4397 [was] sent; 7971-7 and, lo, they came: 935-1 for whom thou didst wash 7364-1 thyself, paintedst 3583-1 thy eyes, 5869 and deckedst 5710-1 thyself with ornaments, 5716

23:41 And satest 3427-1 upon a stately 3520 bed, 4296 and a table 7979 prepared 6186-7 before 6440 it, whereupon thou hast set 7760-1 mine incense 7004 and mine oil. 8081

23:42 And a voice 6963 of a multitude 1995 being at ease 7961 [was] with her: and with the men 582 of the common 7230 sort 120 [were] brought 935-94 Sabeans 5436|5433-6-k from the wilderness, 4057 which put 5414-4 bracelets 6781 upon their hands, 3027 and beautiful 8597 crowns 5850 upon their heads. 7218

23:43 Then said 559-4 I unto [her that was] old 1087 in adulteries, 5004 Will they now commit 2181-4 whoredoms 8457 with her, and she [with them]?

23:44 Yet they went in 935-4 unto her, as they go in 935-2 unto a woman 802 that playeth the harlot: 2181-6 so went they in 935-1 unto Aholah 170 and unto Aholibah, 172 the lewd 2154 women. 802

23:45 And the righteous 6662 men, 582 they shall judge 8199-4 them after the manner 4941 of adulteresses, 5003-6 and after the manner 4941 of women that shed 8210-6 blood; 1818 because they [are] adulteresses, 5003-6 and blood 1818 [is] in their hands. 3027

23:46 For thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 I will bring up 5927-53 a company 6951 upon them, and will give 5414-2 them to be removed 2189 and spoiled. 957

23:47 And the company 6951 shall stone 7275-1 them with stones, 68 and dispatch 1254-15 them with their swords; 2719 they shall slay 2026-4 their sons 1121 and their daughters, 1323 and burn up 8313-4 their houses 1004 with fire. 784

23:48 Thus will I cause lewdness 2154 to cease 7673-52 out of the land, 776 that all women 802 may be taught 3256-13 not to do 6213-4 after your lewdness. 2154

23:49 And they shall recompense 5414-1 your lewdness 2154 upon you, and ye shall bear 5375-4 the sins 2399 of your idols: 1544 and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

24:1 Again in the ninth 8671 year, 8141 in the tenth 6224 month, 2320 in the tenth 6218 [day] of the month, 2320 the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

24:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 write 3789-3 thee the name 8034 of the day, 3117 [even] of this same 6106 day: 3117 the king 4428 of Babylon 894 set 5564-1 himself against Jerusalem 3389 this same 6106 day. 3117

24:3 And utter 4911-3 a parable 4912 unto the rebellious 4805 house, 1004 and say 559-1 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Set on 8239-3 a pot, 5518 set [it] on, 8239-3 and also pour 3332-3 water 4325 into it:

24:4 Gather 622-3 the pieces 5409 thereof into it, [even] every good 2896 piece, 5409 the thigh, 3409 and the shoulder; 3802 fill 4390-16 [it] with the choice 4005 bones. 6106

24:5 Take 3947-2 the choice 4005 of the flock, 6629 and burn 1754 also the bones 6106 under it, [and] make it boil 7570-16 well, 7571 and let them seethe 1310-1 the bones 6106 of it therein. 8432

24:6 Wherefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Woe 188 to the bloody 1818 city, 5892 to the pot 5518 whose scum 2457 [is] therein, and whose scum 2457 is not gone out 3318-1 of it! bring it out 3318-54 piece 5409 by piece; 5409 let no lot 1486 fall 5307-1 upon it.

24:7 For her blood 1818 is in the midst 8432 of her; she set 7760-1 it upon the top 6706 of a rock; 5553 she poured 8210-1 it not upon the ground, 776 to cover 3680-15 it with dust; 6083

24:8 That it might cause fury 2534 to come up 5927-53 to take 5358-2 vengeance; 5359 I have set 5414-1 her blood 1818 upon the top 6706 of a rock, 5553 that it should not be covered. 3680-9

24:9 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Woe 188 to the bloody 1818 city! 5892 I will even make the pile 4071 for fire great. 1431-55

24:10 Heap 7235-54 on wood, 6086 kindle 1814-53 the fire, 784 consume 8552-53 the flesh, 1320 and spice 7543-53 it well, 4841 and let the bones 6106 be burned. 2787-11

24:11 Then set 5975-53 it empty 7386 upon the coals 1513 thereof, that the brass 5178 of it may be hot, 3179-4 and may burn, 2787-1 and [that] the filthiness 2932 of it may be molten 5413-8 in it, 8432 [that] the scum 2457 of it may be consumed. 8552-4

24:12 She hath wearied 3811-52 [herself] with lies, 8383 and her great 7227 scum 2457 went not forth 3318-4 out of her: her scum 2457 [shall be] in the fire. 784

24:13 In thy filthiness 2932 [is] lewdness: 2154 because I have purged 2891-14 thee, and thou wast not purged, 2891-1 thou shalt not be purged 2891-4 from thy filthiness 2932 any more, till I have caused my fury 2534 to rest 5117-53 upon thee.

24:14 I the LORD 3068 have spoken 1696-14 [it]: it shall come to pass, 935-6 and I will do 6213-1 [it]; I will not go back, 6544-4 neither will I spare, 2347-4 neither will I repent; 5162-11 according to thy ways, 1870 and according to thy doings, 5949 shall they judge 8199-1 thee, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

24:15 Also the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

24:16 Son 1121 of man, 120 behold, I take away 3947-6 from thee the desire 4261 of thine eyes 5869 with a stroke: 4046 yet neither shalt thou mourn 5594-4 nor weep, 1058-4 neither shall thy tears 1832 run down. 935-4

24:17 Forbear 1826-3 to cry, 602-9 make 6213-4 no mourning 60 for the dead, 4191-5 bind 2280-3 the tire of thine head 6287 upon thee, and put on 7760-4 thy shoes 5275 upon thy feet, 7272 and cover 5844-4 not [thy] lips, 8222 and eat 398-4 not the bread 3899 of men. 582

24:18 So I spake 1696-17 unto the people 5971 in the morning: 1242 and at even 6153 my wife 802 died; 4191-4 and I did 6213-4 in the morning 1242 as I was commanded. 6680-27

24:19 And the people 5971 said 559-4 unto me, Wilt thou not tell 5046-55 us what these [things are] to us, that thou doest 6213-6 [so]?

24:20 Then I answered 559-4 them, The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

24:21 Speak 559-3 unto the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I will profane 2490-18 my sanctuary, 4720 the excellency 1347 of your strength, 5797 the desire 4261 of your eyes, 5869 and that which your soul 5315 pitieth; 4263 and your sons 1121 and your daughters 1323 whom ye have left 5800-1 shall fall 5307-4 by the sword. 2719

24:22 And ye shall do 6213-1 as I have done: 6213-1 ye shall not cover 5844-4 [your] lips, 8222 nor eat 398-4 the bread 3899 of men. 582

24:23 And your tires 6287 [shall be] upon your heads, 7218 and your shoes 5275 upon your feet: 7272 ye shall not mourn 5594-4 nor weep; 1058-4 but ye shall pine away 4743-8 for your iniquities, 5771 and mourn 5098-1 one 376 toward another. 251

24:24 Thus Ezekiel 3168 is unto you a sign: 4159 according to all that he hath done 6213-1 shall ye do: 6213-4 and when this cometh, 935-2 ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

24:25 Also, thou son 1121 of man, 120 [shall it] not [be] in the day 3117 when I take 3947-2 from them their strength, 4581 the joy 4885 of their glory, 8597 the desire 4261 of their eyes, 5869 and that whereupon they set 4853 their minds, 5315 their sons 1121 and their daughters, 1323

24:26 [That] he that escapeth 6412 in that day 3117 shall come 935-4 unto thee, to cause [thee] to hear 2045 [it] with [thine] ears? 241

24:27 In that day 3117 shall thy mouth 6310 be opened 6605-11 to him which is escaped, 6412 and thou shalt speak, 1696-17 and be no more dumb: 481-11 and thou shalt be a sign 4159 unto them; and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

25:1 The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came again unto me, saying, 559-2

25:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 set 7760-3 thy face 6440 against the Ammonites, 1121 5983 and prophesy 5012-10 against them;

25:3 And say 559-1 unto the Ammonites, 1121 5983 Hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Because thou saidst, 559-2 Aha, 1889 against my sanctuary, 4720 when it was profaned; 2490-8 and against the land 127 of Israel, 3478 when it was desolate; 8074-8 and against the house 1004 of Judah, 3063 when they went 1980-1 into captivity; 1473

25:4 Behold, therefore I will deliver 5414-6 thee to the men 1121 of the east 6924 for a possession, 4181 and they shall set 3427-14 their palaces 2918 in thee, and make 5414-1 their dwellings 4908 in thee: they shall eat 398-4 thy fruit, 6529 and they shall drink 8354-4 thy milk. 2461

25:5 And I will make 5414-1 Rabbah 7237 a stable 5116 for camels, 1581 and the Ammonites 1121 5983 a couchingplace 4769 for flocks: 6629 and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

25:6 For thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Because thou hast clapped 4222-15 [thine] hands, 3027 and stamped 7554-2 with the feet, 7272 and rejoiced 8055-4 in heart 5315 with all thy despite 7589 against the land 127 of Israel; 3478

25:7 Behold, therefore I will stretch out 5186-1 mine hand 3027 upon thee, and will deliver 5414-1 thee for a spoil 957|897-k to the heathen; 1471 and I will cut thee off 3772-52 from the people, 5971 and I will cause thee to perish 6-52 out of the countries: 776 I will destroy 8045-55 thee; and thou shalt know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

25:8 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Because that 3282 Moab 4124 and Seir 8165 do say, 559-2 Behold, the house 1004 of Judah 3063 [is] like unto all the heathen; 1471

25:9 Therefore, behold, I will open 6605-6 the side 3802 of Moab 4124 from the cities, 5892 from his cities 5892 [which are] on his frontiers, 7097 the glory 6643 of the country, 776 Bethjeshimoth, 1020 Baalmeon, 1186 and Kiriathaim, 7156

25:10 Unto the men 1121 of the east 6924 with the Ammonites, 1121 5983 and will give 5414-1 them in possession, 4181 that the Ammonites 1121 5983 may not be remembered 2142-11 among the nations. 1471

25:11 And I will execute 6213-4 judgments 8201 upon Moab; 4124 and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

25:12 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Because that Edom 123 hath dealt 6213-2 against the house 1004 of Judah 3063 by taking 5358-2 vengeance, 5359 and hath greatly 816-2 offended, 816-4 and revenged 5358-8 himself upon them;

25:13 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 I will also stretch out 5186-1 mine hand 3027 upon Edom, 123 and will cut off 3772-52 man 120 and beast 929 from it; and I will make 5414-1 it desolate 2723 from Teman; 8487 and they of Dedan 1719 shall fall 5307-4 by the sword. 2719

25:14 And I will lay 5414-1 my vengeance 5360 upon Edom 123 by the hand 3027 of my people 5971 Israel: 3478 and they shall do 6213-1 in Edom 123 according to mine anger 639 and according to my fury; 2534 and they shall know 3045-1 my vengeance, 5360 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

25:15 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Because the Philistines 6430 have dealt 6213-2 by revenge, 5360 and have taken 5358-11 vengeance 5359 with a despiteful 7589 heart, 5315 to destroy 4889 [it] for the old 5769 hatred; 342

25:16 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I will stretch out 5186-6 mine hand 3027 upon the Philistines, 6430 and I will cut off 3772-52 the Cherethims, 3774 and destroy 6-52 the remnant 7611 of the sea 3220 coast. 2348

25:17 And I will execute 6213-1 great 1419 vengeance 5360 upon them with furious 2534 rebukes; 8433 and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 when I shall lay 5414-2 my vengeance 5360 upon them.

26:1 And it came to pass in the eleventh 6249 6240 year, 8141 in the first 259 [day] of the month, 2320 [that] the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

26:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 because that Tyrus 6865 hath said 559-1 against Jerusalem, 3389 Aha, 1889 she is broken 7665-8 [that was] the gates 1817 of the people: 5971 she is turned 5437-8 unto me: I shall be replenished, 4390-11 [now] she is laid waste: 2717-90

26:3 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I [am] against thee, O Tyrus, 6865 and will cause many 7227 nations 1471 to come up 5927-52 against thee, as the sea 3220 causeth his waves 1530 to come up. 5927-53

26:4 And they shall destroy 7843-14 the walls 2346 of Tyrus, 6865 and break down 2040-1 her towers: 4026 I will also scrape 5500-14 her dust 6083 from her, and make 5414-1 her like the top 6706 of a rock. 5553

26:5 It shall be [a place for] the spreading 4894 of nets 2764 in the midst 8432 of the sea: 3220 for I have spoken 1696-14 [it], saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD: 3069 and it shall become a spoil 957 to the nations. 1471

26:6 And her daughters 1323 which [are] in the field 7704 shall be slain 2026-11 by the sword; 2719 and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

26:7 For thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I will bring 935-56 upon Tyrus 6865 Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon, 894 a king 4428 of kings, 4428 from the north, 6828 with horses, 5483 and with chariots, 7393 and with horsemen, 6571 and companies, 6951 and much 7227 people. 5971

26:8 He shall slay 2026-4 with the sword 2719 thy daughters 1323 in the field: 7704 and he shall make 5414-1 a fort 1785 against thee, and cast 8210-1 a mount 5550 against thee, and lift up 6965-52 the buckler 6793 against thee.

26:9 And he shall set 5414-4 engines 4239 of war 6904 against thy walls, 2346 and with his axes 2719 he shall break down 5422-4 thy towers. 4026

26:10 By reason of the abundance 8229 of his horses 5483 their dust 80 shall cover 3680-17 thee: thy walls 2346 shall shake 7493-4 at the noise 6963 of the horsemen, 6571 and of the wheels, 1534 and of the chariots, 7393 when he shall enter 935-2 into thy gates, 8179 as men enter into 3996 a city 5892 wherein is made a breach. 1234-30

26:11 With the hoofs 6541 of his horses 5483 shall he tread down 7429-4 all thy streets: 2351 he shall slay 2026-4 thy people 5971 by the sword, 2719 and thy strong 5797 garrisons 4676 shall go down 3381-4 to the ground. 776

26:12 And they shall make a spoil 7997-1 of thy riches, 2428 and make a prey 962-1 of thy merchandise: 7404 and they shall break down 2040-1 thy walls, 2346 and destroy 5422-4 thy pleasant 2532 houses: 1004 and they shall lay 7760-4 thy stones 68 and thy timber 6086 and thy dust 6083 in the midst 8432 of the water. 4325

26:13 And I will cause the noise 1995 of thy songs 7892 to cease; 7673-52 and the sound 6963 of thy harps 3658 shall be no more heard. 8085-11

26:14 And I will make 5414-1 thee like the top 6706 of a rock: 5553 thou shalt be [a place] to spread 4894 nets 2764 upon; thou shalt be built 1129-11 no more: for I the LORD 3068 have spoken 1696-14 [it], saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

26:15 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD 3069 to Tyrus; 6865 Shall not the isles 339 shake 7493-4 at the sound 6963 of thy fall, 4658 when the wounded 2491 cry, 602-2 when the slaughter 2027 is made 2026-9 in the midst 8432 of thee?

26:16 Then all the princes 5387 of the sea 3220 shall come down 3381-1 from their thrones, 3678 and lay away 5493-52 their robes, 4598 and put off 6584-4 their broidered 7553 garments: 899 they shall clothe 3847-4 themselves with trembling; 2731 they shall sit 3427-4 upon the ground, 776 and shall tremble 2729-1 at [every] moment, 7281 and be astonished 8074-1 at thee.

26:17 And they shall take up 5375-1 a lamentation 7015 for thee, and say 559-1 to thee, How art thou destroyed, 6-1 [that wast] inhabited 3427-12 of seafaring men, 3220 the renowned 1984-30 city, 5892 which wast strong 2389 in the sea, 3220 she and her inhabitants, 3427-6 which cause 5414-1 their terror 2851 [to be] on all that haunt 3427-6 it!

26:18 Now shall the isles 339 tremble 2729-4 in the day 3117 of thy fall; 4658 yea, the isles 339 that [are] in the sea 3220 shall be troubled 926-8 at thy departure. 3318-2

26:19 For thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 When I shall make 5414-2 thee a desolate 2717-12 city, 5892 like the cities 5892 that are not inhabited; 3427-8 when I shall bring up 5927-53 the deep 8415 upon thee, and great 7227 waters 4325 shall cover 3680-14 thee;

26:20 When I shall bring thee down 3381-52 with them that descend 3381-6 into the pit, 953 with the people 5971 of old time, 5769 and shall set 3427-52 thee in the low parts 8482 of the earth, 776 in places desolate 2723 of old, 5769 with them that go down 3381-6 to the pit, 953 that thou be not inhabited; 3427-4 and I shall set 5414-1 glory 6643 in the land 776 of the living; 2416

26:21 I will make 5414-4 thee a terror, 1091 and thou [shalt be] no [more]: though thou be sought for, 1245-29 yet shalt thou never 3808 5769 be found 4672-11 again, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

27:1 The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came again unto me, saying, 559-2

27:2 Now, thou son 1121 of man, 120 take up 5375-3 a lamentation 7015 for Tyrus; 6865

27:3 And say 559-1 unto Tyrus, 6865 O thou that art situate 3427-6 at the entry 3997 of the sea, 3220 [which art] a merchant 7402-6 of the people 5971 for many 7227 isles, 339 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 O Tyrus, 6865 thou hast said, 559-1 I [am] of perfect 3632 beauty. 3308

27:4 Thy borders 1366 [are] in the midst 3820 of the seas, 3220 thy builders 1129-6 have perfected 3634-1 thy beauty. 3308

27:5 They have made 1129-1 all thy [ship] boards 3871 of fir trees 1265 of Senir: 8149 they have taken 3947-1 cedars 730 from Lebanon 3844 to make 6213-2 masts 8650 for thee.

27:6 [Of] the oaks 437 of Bashan 1316 have they made 6213-1 thine oars; 4880 the company 1323 of the Ashurites 839|838 have made 6213-1 thy benches 7175 [of] ivory, 8127 [brought] out of the isles 339 of Chittim. 3794

27:7 Fine linen 8336 with broidered work 7553 from Egypt 4714 was that which thou spreadest forth 4666 to be thy sail; 5251 blue 8504 and purple 713 from the isles 339 of Elishah 473 was that which covered 4374 thee.

27:8 The inhabitants 3427-6 of Zidon 6721 and Arvad 719 were thy mariners: 7751-5 thy wise 2450 [men], O Tyrus, 6865 [that] were in thee, were thy pilots. 2259

27:9 The ancients 2205 of Gebal 1380 and the wise 2450 [men] thereof were in thee thy calkers: 919 2388-56 all the ships 591 of the sea 3220 with their mariners 4419 were in thee to occupy 6148-2 thy merchandise. 4627

27:10 They of Persia 6539 and of Lud 3865 and of Phut 6316 were in thine army, 2428 thy men 582 of war: 4421 they hanged 8518-14 the shield 4043 and helmet 3553 in thee; they set forth 5414-1 thy comeliness. 1926

27:11 The men 1121 of Arvad 719 with thine army 2428 [were] upon thy walls 2346 round about, 5439 and the Gammadims 1575 were in thy towers: 4026 they hanged 8518-14 their shields 7982 upon thy walls 2346 round about; 5439 they have made thy beauty 3308 perfect. 3634-1

27:12 Tarshish 8659 [was] thy merchant 5503-6 by reason of the multitude 7230 of all [kind of] riches; 1952 with silver, 3701 iron, 1270 tin, 913 and lead, 5777 they traded 5414-1 in thy fairs. 5801

27:13 Javan, 3120 Tubal, 8422 and Meshech, 4902 they [were] thy merchants: 7402-6 they traded 5414-1 the persons 5315 of men 120 and vessels 3627 of brass 5178 in thy market. 4627

27:14 They of the house 1004 of Togarmah 8425 traded 5414-1 in thy fairs 5801 with horses 5483 and horsemen 6571 and mules. 6505

27:15 The men 1121 of Dedan 1719 [were] thy merchants; 7402-6 many 7227 isles 339 [were] the merchandise 5506 of thine hand: 3027 they brought 7725-52 thee [for] a present 814 horns 7161 of ivory 8127 and ebony. 1894

27:16 Syria 758 [was] thy merchant 5503-6 by reason of the multitude 7230 of the wares of thy making: 4639 they occupied 5414-1 in thy fairs 5801 with emeralds, 5306 purple, 713 and broidered work, 7553 and fine linen, 948 and coral, 7215 and agate. 3539

27:17 Judah, 3063 and the land 776 of Israel, 3478 they [were] thy merchants: 7402-6 they traded 5414-1 in thy market 4627 wheat 2406 of Minnith, 4511 and Pannag, 6436 and honey, 1706 and oil, 8081 and balm. 6875

27:18 Damascus 1834 [was] thy merchant 5503-6 in the multitude 7230 of the wares of thy making, 4639 for the multitude 7230 of all riches; 1952 in the wine 3196 of Helbon, 2463 and white 6713 wool. 6785

27:19 Dan 2051|1835 also and Javan 3120 going to and fro 235-30 occupied 5414-1 in thy fairs: 5801 bright 6219 iron, 1270 cassia, 6916 and calamus, 7070 were in thy market. 4627

27:20 Dedan 1719 [was] thy merchant 7402-6 in precious 2667 clothes 899 for chariots. 7396

27:21 Arabia, 6152 and all the princes 5387 of Kedar, 6938 they occupied 5503-6 with thee 3027 in lambs, 3733 and rams, 352 and goats: 6260 in these [were they] thy merchants. 5503-6

27:22 The merchants 7402-6 of Sheba 7614 and Raamah, 7484 they [were] thy merchants: 7402-6 they occupied 5414-1 in thy fairs 5801 with chief 7218 of all spices, 1314 and with all precious 3368 stones, 68 and gold. 2091

27:23 Haran, 2771 and Canneh, 3656 and Eden, 5729 the merchants 7402-6 of Sheba, 7614 Asshur, 804 [and] Chilmad, 3638 [were] thy merchants. 7402-6

27:24 These [were] thy merchants 7402-6 in all sorts 4360 [of things], in blue 8504 clothes, 1545 and broidered work, 7553 and in chests 1595 of rich apparel, 1264 bound 2280-7 with cords, 2256 and made of cedar, 729 among thy merchandise. 4819

27:25 The ships 591 of Tarshish 8659 did sing 7788-6 of thee in thy market: 4627 and thou wast replenished, 4390-11 and made very 3966 glorious 3513-4 in the midst 3820 of the seas. 3220

27:26 Thy rowers 7751-5 have brought 935-52 thee into great 7227 waters: 4325 the east 6921 wind 7307 hath broken 7665-1 thee in the midst 3820 of the seas. 3220

27:27 Thy riches, 1952 and thy fairs, 5801 thy merchandise, 4627 thy mariners, 4419 and thy pilots, 2259 thy calkers, 919 2388-56 and the occupiers 6148-6 of thy merchandise, 4627 and all thy men 582 of war, 4421 that [are] in thee, and in all thy company 6951 which [is] in the midst 8432 of thee, shall fall 5307-4 into the midst 3820 of the seas 3220 in the day 3117 of thy ruin. 4658

27:28 The suburbs 4054 shall shake 7493-4 at the sound 6963 of the cry 2201 of thy pilots. 2259

27:29 And all that handle 8610-6 the oar, 4880 the mariners, 4419 [and] all the pilots 2259 of the sea, 3220 shall come down 3381-1 from their ships, 591 they shall stand 5975-4 upon the land; 776

27:30 And shall cause their voice 6963 to be heard 8085-52 against thee, and shall cry 2199-4 bitterly, 4751 and shall cast up 5927-55 dust 6083 upon their heads, 7218 they shall wallow 6428-101 themselves in the ashes: 665

27:31 And they shall make themselves utterly 7144 bald 7139-52 for thee, and gird 2296-1 them with sackcloth, 8242 and they shall weep 1058-1 for thee with bitterness 4751 of heart 5315 [and] bitter 4751 wailing. 4553

27:32 And in their wailing 5204 they shall take up 5375-1 a lamentation 7015 for thee, and lament 6969-31 over thee, [saying], What [city is] like Tyrus, 6865 like the destroyed 1822 in the midst 8432 of the sea? 3220

27:33 When thy wares 5801 went forth 3318-2 out of the seas, 3220 thou filledst 7646-52 many 7227 people; 5971 thou didst enrich 6238-52 the kings 4428 of the earth 776 with the multitude 7230 of thy riches 1952 and of thy merchandise. 4627

27:34 In the time 6256 [when] thou shalt be broken 7665-12 by the seas 3220 in the depths 4615 of the waters 4325 thy merchandise 4627 and all thy company 6951 in the midst 8432 of thee shall fall. 5307-1

27:35 All the inhabitants 3427-6 of the isles 339 shall be astonished 8074-1 at thee, and their kings 4428 shall be sore 8178 afraid, 8175-1 they shall be troubled 7481-1 in [their] countenance. 6440

27:36 The merchants 5503-6 among the people 5971 shall hiss 8319-1 at thee; thou shalt be a terror, 1091 and never [shalt be] any more. 5704 5769

28:1 The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came again unto me, saying, 559-2

28:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 say 559-3 unto the prince 5057 of Tyrus, 6865 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Because thine heart 3820 [is] lifted up, 1361-1 and thou hast said, 559-4 I [am] a God, 410 I sit 3427-1 [in] the seat 4186 of God, 430 in the midst 3820 of the seas; 3220 yet thou [art] a man, 120 and not God, 410 though thou set 5414-4 thine heart 3820 as the heart 3820 of God: 430

28:3 Behold, thou [art] wiser 2450 than Daniel; 1840 there is no secret 5640-7 that they can hide 6004-1 from thee:

28:4 With thy wisdom 2451 and with thine understanding 8394 thou hast gotten 6213-1 thee riches, 2428 and hast gotten 6213-4 gold 2091 and silver 3701 into thy treasures: 214

28:5 By thy great 7230 wisdom 2451 [and] by thy traffick 7404 hast thou increased 7235-52 thy riches, 2428 and thine heart 3824 is lifted up 1361-4 because of thy riches: 2428

28:6 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Because thou hast set 5414-2 thine heart 3824 as the heart 3820 of God; 430

28:7 Behold, therefore I will bring 935-56 strangers 2114-5 upon thee, the terrible 6184 of the nations: 1471 and they shall draw 7324-52 their swords 2719 against the beauty 3308 of thy wisdom, 2451 and they shall defile 2490-14 thy brightness. 3314

28:8 They shall bring thee down 3381-55 to the pit, 7845 and thou shalt die 4191-1 the deaths 4463 of [them that are] slain 2491 in the midst 3820 of the seas. 3220

28:9 Wilt thou yet 559-2 say 559-4 before 6440 him that slayeth 2026-6 thee, I [am] God? 430 but thou [shalt be] a man, 120 and no God, 410 in the hand 3027 of him that slayeth 2490-18 thee.

28:10 Thou shalt die 4191-4 the deaths 4194 of the uncircumcised 6189 by the hand 3027 of strangers: 2114-5 for I have spoken 1696-14 [it], saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

28:11 Moreover the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

28:12 Son 1121 of man, 120 take up 5375-3 a lamentation 7015 upon the king 4428 of Tyrus, 6865 and say 559-1 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Thou sealest up 2856-6 the sum, 8508 full 4392 of wisdom, 2451 and perfect 3632 in beauty. 3308

28:13 Thou hast been in Eden 5731 the garden 1588 of God; 430 every precious 3368 stone 68 [was] thy covering, 4540 the sardius, 124 topaz, 6357 and the diamond, 3095 the beryl, 8658 the onyx, 7718 and the jasper, 3471 the sapphire, 5601 the emerald, 5306 and the carbuncle, 1304 and gold: 2091 the workmanship 4399 of thy tabrets 8596 and of thy pipes 5345 was prepared 3559-49 in thee in the day 3117 that thou wast created. 1254-9

28:14 Thou [art] the anointed 4473 cherub 3742 that covereth; 5526-6 and I have set 5414-1 thee [so]: thou wast upon the holy 6944 mountain 2022 of God; 430 thou hast walked up and down 1980-98 in the midst 8432 of the stones 68 of fire. 784

28:15 Thou [wast] perfect 8549 in thy ways 1870 from the day 3117 that thou wast created, 1254-9 till iniquity 5766 was found 4672-8 in thee.

28:16 By the multitude 7230 of thy merchandise 7404 they have filled 4390-1 the midst 8432 of thee with violence, 2555 and thou hast sinned: 2398-4 therefore I will cast thee as profane 2490-17 out of the mountain 2022 of God: 430 and I will destroy 6-17 thee, O covering 5526-6 cherub, 3742 from the midst 8432 of the stones 68 of fire. 784

28:17 Thine heart 3820 was lifted up 1361-1 because of thy beauty, 3308 thou hast corrupted 7843-14 thy wisdom 2451 by reason of 5921 thy brightness: 3314 I will cast 7993-52 thee to the ground, 776 I will lay 5414-1 thee before 6440 kings, 4428 that they may behold 7200-2 thee.

28:18 Thou hast defiled 2490-14 thy sanctuaries 4720 by the multitude 7230 of thine iniquities, 5771 by the iniquity 5766 of thy traffick; 7404 therefore will I bring forth 3318-55 a fire 784 from the midst 8432 of thee, it shall devour 398-1 thee, and I will bring 5414-4 thee to ashes 665 upon the earth 776 in the sight 5869 of all them that behold 7200-6 thee.

28:19 All they that know 3045-6 thee among the people 5971 shall be astonished 8074-1 at thee: thou shalt be a terror, 1091 and never 369 [shalt] thou [be] any more. 5704 5769

28:20 Again the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

28:21 Son 1121 of man, 120 set 7760-3 thy face 6440 against Zidon, 6721 and prophesy 5012-10 against it,

28:22 And say, 559-1 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I [am] against thee, O Zidon; 6721 and I will be glorified 3513-8 in the midst 8432 of thee: and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 when I shall have executed 6213-2 judgments 8201 in her, and shall be sanctified 6942-8 in her.

28:23 For I will send 7971-14 into her pestilence, 1698 and blood 1818 into her streets; 2351 and the wounded 2491 shall be judged 5307-40 in the midst 8432 of her by the sword 2719 upon her on every side; 5439 and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

28:24 And there shall be no more a pricking 3992-56 brier 5544 unto the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 nor [any] grieving 3510-56 thorn 6975 of all [that are] round about 5439 them, that despised 7590-5 them; and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

28:25 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 When I shall have gathered 6908-15 the house 1004 of Israel 3478 from the people 5971 among whom they are scattered, 6327-8 and shall be sanctified 6942-8 in them in the sight 5869 of the heathen, 1471 then shall they dwell 3427-1 in their land 127 that I have given 5414-1 to my servant 5650 Jacob. 3290

28:26 And they shall dwell 3427-1 safely 983 therein, and shall build 1129-1 houses, 1004 and plant 5193-1 vineyards; 3754 yea, they shall dwell 3427-1 with confidence, 983 when I have executed 6213-2 judgments 8201 upon all those that despise 7590-5 them round about 5439 them; and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD 3068 their God. 430

29:1 In the tenth 6224 year, 8141 in the tenth 6224 [month], in the twelfth 8147 6240 [day] of the month, 2320 the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

29:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 set 7760-3 thy face 6440 against Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt, 4714 and prophesy 5012-10 against him, and against all Egypt: 4714

29:3 Speak, 1696-16 and say, 559-1 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I [am] against thee, Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt, 4714 the great 1419 dragon 8577 that lieth 7257-6 in the midst 8432 of his rivers, 2975 which hath said, 559-1 My river 2975 [is] mine own, and I have made 6213-1 [it] for myself.

29:4 But I will put 5414-1 hooks 2397|2397-q in thy jaws, 3895 and I will cause the fish 1710 of thy rivers 2975 to stick 1692-52 unto thy scales, 7193 and I will bring thee up 5927-52 out of the midst 8432 of thy rivers, 2975 and all the fish 1710 of thy rivers 2975 shall stick 1692-4 unto thy scales. 7193

29:5 And I will leave 5203-1 thee [thrown] into the wilderness, 4057 thee and all the fish 1710 of thy rivers: 2975 thou shalt fall 5307-4 upon the open 6440 fields; 7704 thou shalt not be brought together, 622-11 nor gathered: 6908-11 I have given 5414-1 thee for meat 402 to the beasts 2416 of the field 776 and to the fowls 5775 of the heaven. 8064

29:6 And all the inhabitants 3427-6 of Egypt 4714 shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 because they have been a staff 4938 of reed 7070 to the house 1004 of Israel. 3478

29:7 When they took hold 8610-2 of thee by thy hand, 3709 thou didst break, 7533-11 and rend 1234-1 all their shoulder: 3802 and when they leaned 8172-9 upon thee, thou brakest, 7665-11 and madest all their loins 4975 to be at a stand. 5976-52

29:8 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I will bring 935-56 a sword 2719 upon thee, and cut off 3772-52 man 120 and beast 929 out of thee.

29:9 And the land 776 of Egypt 4714 shall be desolate 8077 and waste; 2723 and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD: 3068 because he hath said, 559-1 The river 2975 [is] mine, and I have made 6213-1 [it].

29:10 Behold, therefore I [am] against thee, and against thy rivers, 2975 and I will make 5414-1 the land 776 of Egypt 4714 utterly 2721 waste 2723 [and] desolate, 8077 from the tower 4024 of Syene 5482 even unto the border 1366 of Ethiopia. 3568

29:11 No foot 7272 of man 120 shall pass 5674-4 through it, nor foot 7272 of beast 929 shall pass 5674-4 through it, neither shall it be inhabited 3427-4 forty 705 years. 8141

29:12 And I will make 5414-1 the land 776 of Egypt 4714 desolate 8077 in the midst 8432 of the countries 776 [that are] desolate, 8074-12 and her cities 5892 among 8432 the cities 5892 [that are] laid waste 2717-94 shall be desolate 8077 forty 705 years: 8141 and I will scatter 6327-52 the Egyptians 4714 among the nations, 1471 and will disperse 2219-14 them through the countries. 776

29:13 Yet thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 At the end 7093 of forty 705 years 8141 will I gather 6908-17 the Egyptians 4714 from the people 5971 whither they were scattered: 6327-8

29:14 And I will bring again 7725-1 the captivity 7622 of Egypt, 4714 and will cause them to return 7725-52 [into] the land 776 of Pathros, 6624 into the land 776 of their habitation; 4351 and they shall be there a base 8217 kingdom. 4467

29:15 It shall be the basest 8217 of the kingdoms; 4467 neither shall it exalt 5375-101 itself any more above the nations: 1471 for I will diminish 4591-52 them, that they shall no more rule 7287-2 over the nations. 1471

29:16 And it shall be no more the confidence 4009 of the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 which bringeth [their] iniquity 5771 to remembrance, 2142-56 when they shall look 6437-2 after 310 them: but they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

29:17 And it came to pass in the seven 7651 and twentieth 6242 year, 8141 in the first 7223 [month], in the first 259 [day] of the month, 2320 the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

29:18 Son 1121 of man, 120 Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 caused his army 2428 to serve 5647-52 a great 1419 service 5656 against Tyrus: 6865 every head 7218 [was] made bald, 7139-94 and every shoulder 3802 [was] peeled: 4803-7 yet had he no wages, 7939 nor his army, 2428 for Tyrus, 6865 for the service 5656 that he had served 5647-1 against it:

29:19 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I will give 5414-6 the land 776 of Egypt 4714 unto Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon; 894 and he shall take 5375-1 her multitude, 1995 and take 7997-1 her spoil, 7998 and take 962-1 her prey; 957 and it shall be the wages 7939 for his army. 2428

29:20 I have given 5414-1 him the land 776 of Egypt 4714 [for] his labour 6468 wherewith he served 5647-1 against it, because they wrought 6213-1 for me, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

29:21 In that day 3117 will I cause the horn 7161 of the house 1004 of Israel 3478 to bud forth, 6779-55 and I will give 5414-4 thee the opening 6610 of the mouth 6310 in the midst 8432 of them; and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

30:1 The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came again unto me, saying, 559-2

30:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 prophesy 5012-10 and say, 559-1 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Howl 3213-54 ye, Woe worth 1929 the day! 3117

30:3 For the day 3117 [is] near, 7138 even the day 3117 of the LORD 3068 [is] near, 7138 a cloudy 6051 day; 3117 it shall be the time 6256 of the heathen. 1471

30:4 And the sword 2719 shall come 935-1 upon Egypt, 4714 and great pain 2479 shall be in Ethiopia, 3568 when the slain 2491 shall fall 5307-2 in Egypt, 4714 and they shall take away 3947-1 her multitude, 1995 and her foundations 3247 shall be broken down. 2040-8

30:5 Ethiopia, 3568 and Libya, 6316 and Lydia, 3865 and all the mingled people, 6153 and Chub, 3552 and the men 1121 of the land 776 that is in league, 1285 shall fall 5307-4 with them by the sword. 2719

30:6 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 They also that uphold 5564-6 Egypt 4714 shall fall; 5307-1 and the pride 1347 of her power 5797 shall come down: 3381-1 from the tower 4024 of Syene 5482 shall they fall 5307-4 in it by the sword, 2719 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

30:7 And they shall be desolate 8074-8 in the midst 8432 of the countries 776 [that are] desolate, 8074-12 and her cities 5892 shall be in the midst 8432 of the cities 5892 [that are] wasted. 2717-12

30:8 And they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 when I have set 5414-2 a fire 784 in Egypt, 4714 and [when] all her helpers 5826-6 shall be destroyed. 7665-8

30:9 In that day 3117 shall messengers 4397 go forth 3318-4 from me 6440 in ships 6716 to make the careless 983 Ethiopians 3568 afraid, 2729-53 and great pain 2479 shall come upon them, as in the day 3117 of Egypt: 4714 for, lo, it cometh. 935-6

30:10 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 I will also make the multitude 1995 of Egypt 4714 to cease 7673-52 by the hand 3027 of Nebuchadrezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon. 894

30:11 He and his people 5971 with him, the terrible 6184 of the nations, 1471 shall be brought 935-94 to destroy 7843-15 the land: 776 and they shall draw 7324-52 their swords 2719 against Egypt, 4714 and fill 4390-1 the land 776 with the slain. 2491

30:12 And I will make 5414-1 the rivers 2975 dry, 2724 and sell 4376-1 the land 776 into the hand 3027 of the wicked: 7451 and I will make the land 776 waste, 8074-52 and all that is therein, 4393 by the hand 3027 of strangers: 2114-5 I the LORD 3068 have spoken 1696-14 [it].

30:13 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 I will also destroy 6-52 the idols, 1544 and I will cause [their] images 457 to cease 7673-52 out of Noph; 5297 and there shall be no more a prince 5387 of the land 776 of Egypt: 4714 and I will put 5414-1 a fear 3374 in the land 776 of Egypt. 4714

30:14 And I will make Pathros 6624 desolate, 8074-52 and will set 5414-1 fire 784 in Zoan, 6814 and will execute 6213-1 judgments 8201 in No. 4996

30:15 And I will pour 8210-1 my fury 2534 upon Sin, 5512 the strength 4581 of Egypt; 4714 and I will cut off 3772-52 the multitude 1995 of No. 4996

30:16 And I will set 5414-1 fire 784 in Egypt: 4714 Sin 5512 shall have great 2342-2 pain, 2342-4 and No 4996 shall be rent asunder, 1234-9 and Noph 5297 [shall have] distresses 6862 daily. 3119

30:17 The young men 970 of Aven 205 and of Pibeseth 6364 shall fall 5307-4 by the sword: 2719 and these [cities] shall go 3212-4 into captivity. 7628

30:18 At Tehaphnehes 8471 also the day 3117 shall be darkened, 2821-1|2820-1-q when I shall break 7665-2 there the yokes 4133 of Egypt: 4714 and the pomp 1347 of her strength 5797 shall cease 7673-8 in her: as for her, 1931 a cloud 6051 shall cover 3680-17 her, and her daughters 1323 shall go 3212-4 into captivity. 7628

30:19 Thus will I execute 6213-1 judgments 8201 in Egypt: 4714 and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

30:20 And it came to pass in the eleventh 259 6240 year, 8141 in the first 7223 [month], in the seventh 7651 [day] of the month, 2320 [that] the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

30:21 Son 1121 of man, 120 I have broken 7665-1 the arm 2220 of Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt; 4714 and, lo, it shall not be bound up 2280-27 to be 5414-2 healed, 7499 to put 7760-2 a roller 2848 to bind 2280-2 it, to make it strong 2388-2 to hold 8610-2 the sword. 2719

30:22 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I [am] against Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt, 4714 and will break 7665-1 his arms, 2220 the strong, 2389 and that which was broken; 7665-12 and I will cause the sword 2719 to fall 5307-52 out of his hand. 3027

30:23 And I will scatter 6327-52 the Egyptians 4714 among the nations, 1471 and will disperse 2219-14 them through the countries. 776

30:24 And I will strengthen 2388-14 the arms 2220 of the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and put 5414-1 my sword 2719 in his hand: 3027 but I will break 7665-1 Pharaoh's 6547 arms, 2220 and he shall groan 5008-1 before 6440 him with the groanings 5009 of a deadly wounded 2491 [man].

30:25 But I will strengthen 2388-52 the arms 2220 of the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and the arms 2220 of Pharaoh 6547 shall fall down; 5307-4 and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 when I shall put 5414-2 my sword 2719 into the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and he shall stretch it out 5186-1 upon the land 776 of Egypt. 4714

30:26 And I will scatter 6327-52 the Egyptians 4714 among the nations, 1471 and disperse 2219-14 them among the countries; 776 and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

31:1 And it came to pass in the eleventh 259 6240 year, 8141 in the third 7992 [month], in the first 259 [day] of the month, 2320 [that] the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

31:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 speak 559-3 unto Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt, 4714 and to his multitude; 1995 Whom art thou like 1819-1 in thy greatness? 1433

31:3 Behold, the Assyrian 804 [was] a cedar 730 in Lebanon 3844 with fair 3303 branches, 6057 and with a shadowing 6751-56 shroud, 2793 and of an high 1362 stature; 6967 and his top 6788 was among the thick boughs. 5688

31:4 The waters 4325 made him great, 1431-14 the deep 8415 set him up on high 7311-31 with her rivers 5104 running 1980-6 round about 5439 his plants, 4302 and sent out 7971-14 her little rivers 8585 unto all the trees 6086 of the field. 7704

31:5 Therefore his height 6967 was exalted 1361-1 above all the trees 6086 of the field, 7704 and his boughs 5634 were multiplied, 7235-4 and his branches 6288 became long 748-4 because of the multitude 7227 of waters, 4325 when he shot forth. 7971-15

31:6 All the fowls 5775 of heaven 8064 made their nests 7077-14 in his boughs, 5589 and under his branches 6288 did all the beasts 2416 of the field 7704 bring forth 3205-1 their young, and under his shadow 6738 dwelt 3427-4 all great 7227 nations. 1471

31:7 Thus was he fair 3302-4 in his greatness, 1433 in the length 753 of his branches: 1808 for his root 8328 was by great 7227 waters. 4325

31:8 The cedars 730 in the garden 1588 of God 430 could not hide 6004-1 him: the fir trees 1265 were not like 1819-1 his boughs, 5589 and the chesnut trees 6196 were not like his branches; 6288 nor any tree 6086 in the garden 1588 of God 430 was like 1819-1 unto him in his beauty. 3308

31:9 I have made 6213-1 him fair 3303 by the multitude 7230 of his branches: 1808 so that all the trees 6086 of Eden, 5731 that [were] in the garden 1588 of God, 430 envied 7065-17 him.

31:10 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Because thou hast lifted up 1361-1 thyself in height, 6967 and he hath shot up 5414-4 his top 6788 among the thick boughs, 5688 and his heart 3824 is lifted up 7311-1 in his height; 1363

31:11 I have therefore delivered 5414-4 him into the hand 3027 of the mighty 410 one of the heathen; 1471 he shall surely 6213-2 deal 6213-4 with him: I have driven him out 1644-14 for his wickedness. 7562

31:12 And strangers, 2114-5 the terrible 6184 of the nations, 1471 have cut him off, 3772-4 and have left 5203-4 him: upon the mountains 2022 and in all the valleys 1516 his branches 1808 are fallen, 5307-1 and his boughs 6288 are broken 7665-11 by all the rivers 650 of the land; 776 and all the people 5971 of the earth 776 are gone down 3381-4 from his shadow, 6738 and have left 5203-4 him.

31:13 Upon his ruin 4658 shall all the fowls 5775 of the heaven 8064 remain, 7931-4 and all the beasts 2416 of the field 7704 shall be upon his branches: 6288

31:14 To the end that none of all the trees 6086 by the waters 4325 exalt 1361-4 themselves for their height, 6967 neither shoot up 5414-4 their top 6788 among the thick boughs, 5688 neither their trees 352 stand up 5975-4 in their height, 1363 all that drink 8354-6 water: 4325 for they are all delivered 5414-8 unto death, 4194 to the nether parts 8482 of the earth, 776 in the midst 8432 of the children 1121 of men, 120 with them that go down 3381-6 to the pit. 953

31:15 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 In the day 3117 when he went down 3381-2 to the grave 7585 I caused a mourning: 56-52 I covered 3680-14 the deep 8415 for him, and I restrained 4513-4 the floods 5104 thereof, and the great 7227 waters 4325 were stayed: 3607-11 and I caused Lebanon 3844 to mourn 6937-55 for him, and all the trees 6086 of the field 7704 fainted 5969 for him.

31:16 I made the nations 1471 to shake 7493-52 at the sound 6963 of his fall, 4658 when I cast him down 3381-53 to hell 7585 with them that descend 3381-6 into the pit: 953 and all the trees 6086 of Eden, 5731 the choice 4005 and best 2896 of Lebanon, 3844 all that drink 8354-6 water, 4325 shall be comforted 5162-11 in the nether parts 8482 of the earth. 776

31:17 They also went down 3381-1 into hell 7585 with him unto [them that be] slain 2491 with the sword; 2719 and [they that were] his arm, 2220 [that] dwelt 3427-1 under his shadow 6738 in the midst 8432 of the heathen. 1471

31:18 To whom art thou thus like 1819-1 in glory 3519 and in greatness 1433 among the trees 6086 of Eden? 5731 yet shalt thou be brought down 3381-90 with the trees 6086 of Eden 5731 unto the nether parts 8482 of the earth: 776 thou shalt lie 7901-4 in the midst 8432 of the uncircumcised 6189 with [them that be] slain 2491 by the sword. 2719 This [is] Pharaoh 6547 and all his multitude, 1995 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

32:1 And it came to pass in the twelfth 8147 6240 year, 8141 in the twelfth 8147 6240 month, 2320 in the first 259 [day] of the month, 2320 [that] the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

32:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 take up 5375-3 a lamentation 7015 for Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt, 4714 and say 559-1 unto him, Thou art like 1819-8 a young lion 3715 of the nations, 1471 and thou [art] as a whale 8577 in the seas: 3220 and thou camest forth 1518-4 with thy rivers, 5104 and troubledst 1804-4 the waters 4325 with thy feet, 7272 and fouledst 7515-4 their rivers. 5104

32:3 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 I will therefore spread out 6566-1 my net 7568 over thee with a company 6951 of many 7227 people; 5971 and they shall bring thee up 5927-52 in my net. 2764

32:4 Then will I leave 5203-1 thee upon the land, 776 I will cast thee forth 2904-55 upon the open 6440 field, 7704 and will cause all the fowls 5775 of the heaven 8064 to remain 7931-52 upon thee, and I will fill 7646-52 the beasts 2416 of the whole earth 776 with thee.

32:5 And I will lay 5414-1 thy flesh 1320 upon the mountains, 2022 and fill 4390-14 the valleys 1516 with thy height. 7419

32:6 I will also water 8248-52 with thy blood 1818 the land 776 wherein thou swimmest, 6824 [even] to the mountains; 2022 and the rivers 650 shall be full 4390-11 of thee.

32:7 And when I shall put thee out, 3518-15 I will cover 3680-14 the heaven, 8064 and make the stars 3556 thereof dark; 6937-52 I will cover 3680-17 the sun 8121 with a cloud, 6051 and the moon 3394 shall not give 215-55 her light. 216

32:8 All the bright 3974 lights 216 of heaven 8064 will I make dark 6937-55 over thee, and set 5414-1 darkness 2822 upon thy land, 776 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

32:9 I will also vex 3707-52 the hearts 3820 of many 7227 people, 5971 when I shall bring 935-53 thy destruction 7667 among the nations, 1471 into the countries 776 which thou hast not known. 3045-1

32:10 Yea, I will make many 7227 people 5971 amazed 8074-52 at thee, and their kings 4428 shall be horribly 8178 afraid 8175-4 for thee, when I shall brandish 5774-32 my sword 2719 before them; 6440 and they shall tremble 2729-1 at [every] moment, 7281 every man 376 for his own life, 5315 in the day 3117 of thy fall. 4658

32:11 For thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 The sword 2719 of the king 4428 of Babylon 894 shall come 935-4 upon thee.

32:12 By the swords 2719 of the mighty 1368 will I cause thy multitude 1995 to fall, 5307-55 the terrible 6184 of the nations, 1471 all of them: and they shall spoil 7703-1 the pomp 1347 of Egypt, 4714 and all the multitude 1995 thereof shall be destroyed. 8045-8

32:13 I will destroy 6-52 also all the beasts 929 thereof from beside 5921 the great 7227 waters; 4325 neither shall the foot 7272 of man 120 trouble 1804-4 them any more, nor the hoofs 6541 of beasts 929 trouble 1804-4 them.

32:14 Then will I make their waters 4325 deep, 8257-55 and cause their rivers 5104 to run 3212-55 like oil, 8081 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

32:15 When I shall make 5414-2 the land 776 of Egypt 4714 desolate, 8077 and the country 776 shall be destitute 8074-12 of that whereof it was full, 4393 when I shall smite 5221-53 all them that dwell 3427-6 therein, then shall they know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

32:16 This [is] the lamentation 7015 wherewith they shall lament 6969-31 her: the daughters 1323 of the nations 1471 shall lament 6969-34 her: they shall lament 6969-34 for her, [even] for Egypt, 4714 and for all her multitude, 1995 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

32:17 It came to pass also in the twelfth 8147 6240 year, 8141 in the fifteenth 2568 6240 [day] of the month, 2320 [that] the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

32:18 Son 1121 of man, 120 wail 5091-3 for the multitude 1995 of Egypt, 4714 and cast them down, 3381-54 [even] her, and the daughters 1323 of the famous 117 nations, 1471 unto the nether parts 8482 of the earth, 776 with them that go down 3381-6 into the pit. 953

32:19 Whom dost thou pass in beauty? 5276-1 go down, 3381-3 and be thou laid 7901-92 with the uncircumcised. 6189

32:20 They shall fall 5307-4 in the midst 8432 of [them that are] slain 2491 by the sword: 2719 she is delivered 5414-8 to the sword: 2719 draw 4900-3 her and all her multitudes. 1995

32:21 The strong 410 among the mighty 1368 shall speak 1696-17 to him out of the midst 8432 of hell 7585 with them that help 5826-6 him: they are gone down, 3381-1 they lie 7901-1 uncircumcised, 6189 slain 2491 by the sword. 2719

32:22 Asshur 804 [is] there and all her company: 6951 his graves 6913 [are] about 5439 him: all of them slain, 2491 fallen 5307-6 by the sword: 2719

32:23 Whose graves 6913 are set 5414-8 in the sides 3411 of the pit, 953 and her company 6951 is round about 5439 her grave: 6900 all of them slain, 2491 fallen 5307-6 by the sword, 2719 which caused 5414-1 terror 2851 in the land 776 of the living. 2416

32:24 There [is] Elam 5867 and all her multitude 1995 round about 5439 her grave, 6900 all of them slain, 2491 fallen 5307-6 by the sword, 2719 which are gone down 3381-1 uncircumcised 6189 into the nether parts 8482 of the earth, 776 which caused 5414-1 their terror 2851 in the land 776 of the living; 2416 yet have they borne 5375-4 their shame 3639 with them that go down 3381-6 to the pit. 953

32:25 They have set 5414-1 her a bed 4904 in the midst 8432 of the slain 2491 with all her multitude: 1995 her graves 6913 [are] round about 5439 him: all of them uncircumcised, 6189 slain 2491 by the sword: 2719 though their terror 2851 was caused 5414-12 in the land 776 of the living, 2416 yet have they borne 5375-4 their shame 3639 with them that go down 3381-6 to the pit: 953 he is put 5414-8 in the midst 8432 of [them that be] slain. 2491

32:26 There [is] Meshech, 4902 Tubal, 8422 and all her multitude: 1995 her graves 6913 [are] round about 5439 him: all of them uncircumcised, 6189 slain 2490-30 by the sword, 2719 though they caused 5414-1 their terror 2851 in the land 776 of the living. 2416

32:27 And they shall not lie 7901-4 with the mighty 1368 [that are] fallen 5307-6 of the uncircumcised, 6189 which are gone down 3381-1 to hell 7585 with their weapons 3627 of war: 4421 and they have laid 5414-4 their swords 2719 under their heads, 7218 but their iniquities 5771 shall be upon their bones, 6106 though [they were] the terror 2851 of the mighty 1368 in the land 776 of the living. 2416

32:28 Yea, thou shalt be broken 7665-11 in the midst 8432 of the uncircumcised, 6189 and shalt lie 7901-4 with [them that are] slain 2491 with the sword. 2719

32:29 There [is] Edom, 123 her kings, 4428 and all her princes, 5387 which with their might 1369 are laid 5414-8 by [them that were] slain 2491 by the sword: 2719 they shall lie 7901-4 with the uncircumcised, 6189 and with them that go down 3381-6 to the pit. 953

32:30 There [be] the princes 5257 of the north, 6828 all of them, and all the Zidonians, 6722 which are gone down 3381-1 with the slain; 2491 with their terror 2851 they are ashamed 954-6 of their might; 1369 and they lie 7901-4 uncircumcised 6189 with [them that be] slain 2491 by the sword, 2719 and bear 5375-4 their shame 3639 with them that go down 3381-6 to the pit. 953

32:31 Pharaoh 6547 shall see 7200-4 them, and shall be comforted 5162-8 over all his multitude, 1995 [even] Pharaoh 6547 and all his army 2428 slain 2491 by the sword, 2719 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

32:32 For I have caused 5414-1 my terror 2851 in the land 776 of the living: 2416 and he shall be laid 7901-90 in the midst 8432 of the uncircumcised 6189 with [them that are] slain 2491 with the sword, 2719 [even] Pharaoh 6547 and all his multitude, 1995 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

33:1 Again the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

33:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 speak 1696-16 to the children 1121 of thy people, 5971 and say 559-1 unto them, When I bring 935-55 the sword 2719 upon a land, 776 if the people 5971 of the land 776 take 3947-1 a 259 man 376 of their coasts, 7097 and set 5414-1 him for their watchman: 6822-6

33:3 If when he seeth 7200-1 the sword 2719 come 935-6 upon the land, 776 he blow 8628-1 the trumpet, 7782 and warn 2094-52 the people; 5971

33:4 Then whosoever 8085-6 heareth 8085-1 the sound 6963 of the trumpet, 7782 and taketh not warning; 2094-12 if the sword 2719 come, 935-4 and take him away, 3947-4 his blood 1818 shall be upon his own head. 7218

33:5 He heard 8085-1 the sound 6963 of the trumpet, 7782 and took not warning; 2094-12 his blood 1818 shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning 2094-12 shall deliver 4422-14 his soul. 5315

33:6 But if the watchman 6822-6 see 7200-4 the sword 2719 come, 935-6 and blow 8628-1 not the trumpet, 7782 and the people 5971 be not warned; 2094-12 if the sword 2719 come, 935-4 and take 3947-4 [any] person 5315 from among them, he is taken away 3947-8 in his iniquity; 5771 but his blood 1818 will I require 1875-4 at the watchman's 6822-6 hand. 3027

33:7 So thou, O son 1121 of man, 120 I have set 5414-1 thee a watchman 6822-6 unto the house 1004 of Israel; 3478 therefore thou shalt hear 8085-1 the word 1697 at my mouth, 6310 and warn 2094-52 them from me.

33:8 When I say 559-2 unto the wicked, 7563 O wicked 7563 [man], thou shalt surely 4191-2 die; 4191-4 if thou dost not speak 1696-14 to warn 2094-53 the wicked 7563 from his way, 1870 that wicked 7563 [man] shall die 4191-4 in his iniquity; 5771 but his blood 1818 will I require 1245-17 at thine hand. 3027

33:9 Nevertheless, if thou warn 2094-52 the wicked 7563 of his way 1870 to turn 7725-2 from it; if he do not turn 7725-1 from his way, 1870 he shall die 4191-4 in his iniquity; 5771 but thou hast delivered 5337-52 thy soul. 5315

33:10 Therefore, O thou son 1121 of man, 120 speak 559-3 unto the house 1004 of Israel; 3478 Thus ye speak, 559-1 saying, 559-2 If our transgressions 6588 and our sins 2403 [be] upon us, and we pine away 4743-12 in them, how should we then live? 2421-4

33:11 Say 559-3 unto them, [As] I live, 2416 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 I have no pleasure 2654-4 in the death 4194 of the wicked; 7563 but that the wicked 7563 turn 7725-2 from his way 1870 and live: 2421-1 turn 7725-3 ye, turn 7725-3 ye from your evil 7451 ways; 1870 for why will ye die, 4191-4 O house 1004 of Israel? 3478

33:12 Therefore, thou son 1121 of man, 120 say 559-3 unto the children 1121 of thy people, 5971 The righteousness 6666 of the righteous 6662 shall not deliver 5337-55 him in the day 3117 of his transgression: 6588 as for the wickedness 7564 of the wicked, 7563 he shall not fall 3782-11 thereby in the day 3117 that he turneth 7725-2 from his wickedness; 7562 neither shall the righteous 6662 be able 3201-4 to live 2421-2 for his [righteousness] in the day 3117 that he sinneth. 2398-2

33:13 When I shall say 559-2 to the righteous, 6662 [that] he shall surely 2421-2 live; 2421-4 if he trust 982-1 to his own righteousness, 6666 and commit 6213-1 iniquity, 57 6 all his righteousnesses 6666 shall not be remembered; 2142-11 but for his iniquity 57 6 that he hath committed, 6213-1 he shall die 4191-4 for it.

33:14 Again, when I say 559-2 unto the wicked, 7563 Thou shalt surely 4191-2 die; 4191-4 if he turn 7725-1 from his sin, 2403 and do 6213-1 that which is lawful 4941 and right; 6666

33:15 [If] the wicked 7563 restore 7725-55 the pledge, 2258 give again 7999-17 that he had robbed, 1500 walk 1980-1 in the statutes 2708 of life, 2416 without committing 6213-2 iniquity; 5766 he shall surely 2421-2 live, 2421-4 he shall not die. 4191-4

33:16 None of his sins 2403 that he hath committed 2398-1 shall be mentioned 2142-11 unto him: he hath done 6213-1 that which is lawful 4941 and right; 6666 he shall surely 2421-2 live. 2421-4

33:17 Yet the children 1121 of thy people 5971 say, 559-1 The way 1870 of the Lord 136 is not equal: 8505-11 but as for them, their way 1870 is not equal. 8505-11

33:18 When the righteous 6662 turneth 7725-2 from his righteousness, 6666 and committeth 6213-1 iniquity, 5766 he shall even die 4191-1 thereby.

33:19 But if the wicked 7563 turn 7725-2 from his wickedness, 7564 and do 6213-1 that which is lawful 4941 and right, 6666 he shall live 2421-4 thereby.

33:20 Yet ye say, 559-1 The way 1870 of the Lord 136 is not equal. 8505-11 O ye house 1004 of Israel, 3478 I will judge 8199-4 you every one 376 after his ways. 1870

33:21 And it came to pass in the twelfth 8147 6240 year 8141 of our captivity, 1546 in the tenth 6224 [month], in the fifth 2568 [day] of the month, 2320 [that] one that had escaped 6412 out of Jerusalem 3389 came 935-1 unto me, saying, 559-2 The city 5892 is smitten. 5221-90

33:22 Now the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 was upon me in the evening, 6153 afore 6440 he that was escaped 6412 came; 935-2 and had opened 6605-4 my mouth, 6310 until he came 935-2 to me in the morning; 1242 and my mouth 6310 was opened, 6605-11 and I was no more dumb. 481-8

33:23 Then the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

33:24 Son 1121 of man, 120 they that inhabit 3427-6 those wastes 2723 of the land 127 of Israel 3478 speak, 559-6 saying, 559-2 Abraham 85 was one, 259 and he inherited 3423-4 the land: 776 but we [are] many; 7227 the land 776 is given 5414-8 us for inheritance. 4181

33:25 Wherefore say 559-3 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Ye eat 398-4 with the blood, 1818 and lift up 5375-4 your eyes 5869 toward your idols, 1544 and shed 8210-4 blood: 1818 and shall ye possess 3423-4 the land? 776

33:26 Ye stand 5975-1 upon your sword, 2719 ye work 6213-1 abomination, 8441 and ye defile 2930-14 every one 376 his neighbour's 7453 wife: 802 and shall ye possess 3423-4 the land? 776

33:27 Say 559-4 thou thus unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 [As] I live, 2416 surely they that [are] in the wastes 2723 shall fall 5307-4 by the sword, 2719 and him that [is] in the open 6440 field 7704 will I give 5414-1 to the beasts 2416 to be devoured, 398-2 and they that [be] in the forts 4679 and in the caves 4631 shall die 4191-4 of the pestilence. 1698

33:28 For I will lay 5414-1 the land 776 most desolate, 8077 4923 and the pomp 1347 of her strength 5797 shall cease; 7673-8 and the mountains 2022 of Israel 3478 shall be desolate, 8074-1 that none shall pass through. 5674-6

33:29 Then shall they know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 when I have laid 5414-2 the land 776 most desolate 8077 4923 because of all their abominations 8441 which they have committed. 6213-1

33:30 Also, thou son 1121 of man, 120 the children 1121 of thy people 5971 still are talking 1696-12 against thee by 681 the walls 7023 and in the doors 6607 of the houses, 1004 and speak 1696-14 one 2297 to another, 259 every one 376 to his brother, 251 saying, 559-2 Come, 935-3 I pray you, and hear 8085-3 what is the word 1697 that cometh forth 3318-6 from the LORD. 3068

33:31 And they come 935-4 unto thee as the people 5971 cometh, 3996 and they sit 3427-4 before 6440 thee [as] my people, 5971 and they hear 8085-1 thy words, 1697 but they will not do 6213-4 them: for with their mouth 6310 they shew 6213-6 much love, 5690 [but] their heart 3820 goeth 1980-6 after 310 their covetousness. 1215

33:32 And, lo, thou [art] unto them as a very lovely 5690 song 7892 of one that hath a pleasant 3303 voice, 6963 and can play 5059-15 well 2895-56 on an instrument: for they hear 8085-1 thy words, 1697 but they do 6213-6 them not.

33:33 And when this cometh to pass, 935-2 (lo, it will come,) 935-6 then shall they know 3045-1 that a prophet 5030 hath been among 8432 them.

34:1 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

34:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 prophesy 5012-10 against the shepherds 7462-6 of Israel, 3478 prophesy, 5012-10 and say 559-1 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD 3069 unto the shepherds; 7462-6 Woe 1945 [be] to the shepherds 7462-6 of Israel 3478 that do feed 7462-6 themselves! should not the shepherds 7462-6 feed 7462-4 the flocks? 6629

34:3 Ye eat 398-4 the fat, 2459 and ye clothe 3847-4 you with the wool, 6785 ye kill 2076-4 them that are fed: 1277 [but] ye feed 7462-4 not the flock. 6629

34:4 The diseased 2470-12 have ye not strengthened, 2388-14 neither have ye healed 7495-14 that which was sick, 2470-6 neither have ye bound up 2280-1 [that which was] broken, 7665-12 neither have ye brought again 7725-52 that which was driven away, 5080-12 neither have ye sought 1245-14 that which was lost; 6-6 but with force 2393 and with cruelty 6531 have ye ruled 7287-1 them.

34:5 And they were scattered, 6327-4 because [there is] no shepherd: 7462-6 and they became meat 402 to all the beasts 2416 of the field, 7704 when they were scattered. 6327-4

34:6 My sheep 6629 wandered 7686-4 through all the mountains, 2022 and upon every high 7311-6 hill: 1389 yea, my flock 6629 was scattered 6327-8 upon all the face 6440 of the earth, 776 and none did search 1875-6 or seek 1245-18 [after them].

34:7 Therefore, ye shepherds, 7462-6 hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD; 3068

34:8 [As] I live, 2416 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 surely because my flock 6629 became a prey, 957 and my flock 6629 became meat 402 to every beast 2416 of the field, 7704 because [there was] no shepherd, 7462-6 neither did my shepherds 7462-6 search 1875-1 for my flock, 6629 but the shepherds 7462-6 fed 7462-4 themselves, and fed 7462-1 not my flock; 6629

34:9 Therefore, O ye shepherds, 7462-6 hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD; 3068

34:10 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I [am] against the shepherds; 7462-6 and I will require 1875-1 my flock 6629 at their hand, 3027 and cause them to cease 7673-52 from feeding 7462-2 the flock; 6629 neither shall the shepherds 7462-6 feed 7462-4 themselves any more; for I will deliver 5337-52 my flock 6629 from their mouth, 6310 that they may not be meat 402 for them.

34:11 For thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I, [even] I, will both search 1875-1 my sheep, 6629 and seek them out. 1239-14

34:12 As a shepherd 7462-6 seeketh out 1243 his flock 5739 in the day 3117 that he is among 8432 his sheep 6629 [that are] scattered; 6567-12 so will I seek out 1239-17 my sheep, 6629 and will deliver 5337-52 them out of all places 4725 where they have been scattered 6327-8 in the cloudy 6051 and dark 6205 day. 3117

34:13 And I will bring them out 3318-52 from the people, 5971 and gather 6908-14 them from the countries, 776 and will bring 935-52 them to their own land, 127 and feed 7462-1 them upon the mountains 2022 of Israel 3478 by the rivers, 650 and in all the inhabited places 4186 of the country. 776

34:14 I will feed 7462-4 them in a good 2896 pasture, 4829 and upon the high 4791 mountains 2022 of Israel 3478 shall their fold 5116 be: there shall they lie 7257-4 in a good 2896 fold, 5116 and [in] a fat 8082 pasture 4829 shall they feed 7462-4 upon the mountains 2022 of Israel. 3478

34:15 I will feed 7462-4 my flock, 6629 and I will cause them to lie down, 7257-55 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

34:16 I will seek 1245-17 that which was lost, 6-6 and bring again 7725-55 that which was driven away, 5080-12 and will bind up 2280-4 [that which was] broken, 7665-12 and will strengthen 2388-17 that which was sick: 2470-6 but I will destroy 8045-55 the fat 8082 and the strong; 2389 I will feed 7462-4 them with judgment. 4941

34:17 And [as for] you, 859 O my flock, 6629 thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I judge 8199-6 between cattle 7716 and cattle, 7716 between the rams 352 and the he goats. 6260

34:18 [Seemeth it] a small thing 4592 unto you to have eaten up 7462-4 the good 2896 pasture, 4829 but ye must tread down 7429-4 with your feet 7272 the residue 3499 of your pastures? 4829 and to have drunk 8354-4 of the deep 4950 waters, 4325 but ye must foul 7515-4 the residue 3498-12 with your feet? 7272

34:19 And [as for] my flock, 6629 they eat 7462-4 that which ye have trodden 4823 with your feet; 7272 and they drink 8354-4 that which ye have fouled 4833 with your feet. 7272

34:20 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD 3069 unto them; Behold, I, [even] I, will judge 8199-1 between the fat 1274 cattle 7716 and between the lean 7330 cattle. 7716

34:21 Because ye have thrust 1920-4 with side 6654 and with shoulder, 3802 and pushed 5055-17 all the diseased 2470-12 with your horns, 7161 till ye have scattered 6327-52 them abroad; 2351

34:22 Therefore will I save 3467-52 my flock, 6629 and they shall no more be a prey; 957 and I will judge 8199-1 between cattle 7716 and cattle. 7716

34:23 And I will set up 6965-52 one 259 shepherd 7462-6 over them, and he shall feed 7462-1 them, [even] my servant 5650 David; 1732 he shall feed 7462-4 them, and he shall be their shepherd. 7462-6

34:24 And I the LORD 3068 will be their God, 430 and my servant 5650 David 1732 a prince 5387 among 8432 them; I the LORD 3068 have spoken 1696-14 [it].

34:25 And I will make 3772-1 with them a covenant 1285 of peace, 7965 and will cause the evil 7451 beasts 2416 to cease 7673-52 out of the land: 776 and they shall dwell 3427-1 safely 983 in the wilderness, 4057 and sleep 3462-1 in the woods. 3293|3264-k

34:26 And I will make 5414-1 them and the places round about 5439 my hill 1389 a blessing; 1293 and I will cause the shower 1653 to come down 3381-52 in his season; 6256 there shall be showers 1653 of blessing. 1293

34:27 And the tree 6086 of the field 7704 shall yield 5414-1 her fruit, 6529 and the earth 776 shall yield 5414-4 her increase, 2981 and they shall be safe 983 in their land, 127 and shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 when I have broken 7665-2 the bands 4133 of their yoke, 5923 and delivered 5337-52 them out of the hand 3027 of those that served 5647-6 themselves of them.

34:28 And they shall no more be a prey 957 to the heathen, 1471 neither shall the beast 2416 of the land 776 devour 398-4 them; but they shall dwell 3427-1 safely, 983 and none shall make [them] afraid. 2729-56

34:29 And I will raise up 6965-52 for them a plant 4302 of renown, 8034 and they shall be no more consumed 622-7 with hunger 7458 in the land, 776 neither bear 5375-4 the shame 3639 of the heathen 1471 any more.

34:30 Thus shall they know 3045-1 that I the LORD 3068 their God 430 [am] with them, and [that] they, [even] the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 [are] my people, 5971 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

34:31 And ye 859 my flock, 6629 the flock 6629 of my pasture, 4830 [are] men, 120 [and] I [am] your God, 430 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

35:1 Moreover the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

35:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 set 7760-3 thy face 6440 against mount 2022 Seir, 8165 and prophesy 5012-10 against it,

35:3 And say 559-1 unto it, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, O mount 2022 Seir, 8165 I [am] against thee, and I will stretch out 5186-1 mine hand 3027 against thee, and I will make 5414-1 thee most desolate. 8077 4923

35:4 I will lay 7760-4 thy cities 5892 waste, 2723 and thou shalt be desolate, 8077 and thou shalt know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

35:5 Because thou hast had a perpetual 5769 hatred, 342 and hast shed 5064-55 [the blood of] the children 1121 of Israel 3478 by the force 3027 of the sword 2719 in the time 6256 of their calamity, 343 in the time 6256 [that their] iniquity 5771 [had] an end: 7093

35:6 Therefore, [as] I live, 2416 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 I will prepare 6213-4 thee unto blood, 1818 and blood 1818 shall pursue 7291-4 thee: sith 518 thou hast not hated 8130-1 blood, 1818 even blood 1818 shall pursue 7291-4 thee.

35:7 Thus will I make 5414-1 mount 2022 Seir 8165 most desolate, 8077 8077 and cut off 3772-52 from it him that passeth out 5674-6 and him that returneth. 7725-6

35:8 And I will fill 4390-14 his mountains 2022 with his slain 2491 [men]: in thy hills, 1389 and in thy valleys, 1516 and in all thy rivers, 650 shall they fall 5307-4 that are slain 2491 with the sword. 2719

35:9 I will make 5414-4 thee perpetual 5769 desolations, 8077 and thy cities 5892 shall not return: 7725-4|3427-4-k and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

35:10 Because thou hast said, 559-2 These two 8147 nations 1471 and these two 8147 countries 776 shall be mine, and we will possess 3423-1 it; whereas the LORD 3068 was there:

35:11 Therefore, [as] I live, 2416 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 I will even do 6213-1 according to thine anger, 639 and according to thine envy 7068 which thou hast used 6213-1 out of thy hatred 8135 against them; and I will make myself known 3045-8 among them, when I have judged 8199-4 thee.

35:12 And thou shalt know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 [and that] I have heard 8085-1 all thy blasphemies 5007 which thou hast spoken 559-1 against the mountains 2022 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 They are laid desolate, 8074-1|8077-k they are given 5414-8 us to consume. 402

35:13 Thus with your mouth 6310 ye have boasted 1431-55 against me, and have multiplied 6280-52 your words 1697 against me: I have heard 8085-1 [them].

35:14 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 When the whole earth 776 rejoiceth, 8055-2 I will make 6213-4 thee desolate. 8077

35:15 As thou didst rejoice 8057 at the inheritance 5159 of the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 because it was desolate, 8074-1 so will I do 6213-4 unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, 8077 O mount 2022 Seir, 8165 and all Idumea, 123 [even] all of it: and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

36:1 Also, thou son 1121 of man, 120 prophesy 5012-10 unto the mountains 2022 of Israel, 3478 and say, 559-1 Ye mountains 2022 of Israel, 3478 hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD: 3068

36:2 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Because the enemy 341-6 hath said 559-1 against you, Aha, 1889 even the ancient 5769 high places 1116 are ours in possession: 4181

36:3 Therefore prophesy 5012-10 and say, 559-1 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Because they have made [you] desolate, 8074-2 and swallowed you up 7602-2 on every side, 5439 that ye might be a possession 4181 unto the residue 7611 of the heathen, 1471 and ye are taken up 5927-11 in the lips 8193 of talkers, 3956 and [are] an infamy 1681 of the people: 5971

36:4 Therefore, ye mountains 2022 of Israel, 3478 hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD 3069 to the mountains, 2022 and to the hills, 1389 to the rivers, 650 and to the valleys, 1516 to the desolate 8074-6 wastes, 2723 and to the cities 5892 that are forsaken, 5800-12 which became a prey 957 and derision 3933 to the residue 7611 of the heathen 1471 that [are] round about; 5439

36:5 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Surely in the fire 784 of my jealousy 7068 have I spoken 1696-14 against the residue 7611 of the heathen, 1471 and against all Idumea, 123 which have appointed 5414-1 my land 776 into their possession 4181 with the joy 8057 of all [their] heart, 3824 with despiteful 7589 minds, 5315 to cast it out 4054 for a prey. 957

36:6 Prophesy 5012-10 therefore concerning the land 127 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto the mountains, 2022 and to the hills, 1389 to the rivers, 650 and to the valleys, 1516 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I have spoken 1696-14 in my jealousy 7068 and in my fury, 2534 because ye have borne 5375-1 the shame 3639 of the heathen: 1471

36:7 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 I have lifted up 5375-1 mine hand, 3027 Surely the heathen 1471 that [are] about 5439 you, they shall bear 5375-4 their shame. 3639

36:8 But ye, O mountains 2022 of Israel, 3478 ye shall shoot forth 5414-4 your branches, 6057 and yield 5375-4 your fruit 6529 to my people 5971 of Israel; 3478 for they are at hand 7126-14 to come. 935-2

36:9 For, behold, I [am] for you, and I will turn 6437-1 unto you, and ye shall be tilled 5647-8 and sown: 2232-8

36:10 And I will multiply 7235-52 men 120 upon you, all the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 [even] all of it: and the cities 5892 shall be inhabited, 3427-8 and the wastes 2723 shall be builded: 1129-11

36:11 And I will multiply 7235-52 upon you man 120 and beast; 929 and they shall increase 7235-1 and bring fruit: 6509-1 and I will settle 3427-52 you after your old estates, 6927 and will do better 2895-52 [unto you] than at your beginnings: 7221 and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

36:12 Yea, I will cause men 120 to walk 3212-52 upon you, [even] my people 5971 Israel; 3478 and they shall possess 3423-1 thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, 5159 and thou shalt no more 3254-55 henceforth bereave 7921-15 them [of men].

36:13 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Because they say 559-6 unto you, Thou [land] devourest 398-6 up men, 120 and hast bereaved 7921-18 thy nations; 1471

36:14 Therefore thou shalt devour 398-4 men 120 no more, neither bereave 7921-17 3782-17 thy nations 1471 any more, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

36:15 Neither will I cause [men] to hear 8085-55 in thee the shame 3639 of the heathen 1471 any more, neither shalt thou bear 5375-4 the reproach 2781 of the people 5971 any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations 1471 to fall 3782-55 any more, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

36:16 Moreover the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

36:17 Son 1121 of man, 120 when the house 1004 of Israel 3478 dwelt 3427-6 in their own land, 127 they defiled 2930-17 it by their own way 1870 and by their doings: 5949 their way 1870 was before 6440 me as the uncleanness 2932 of a removed woman. 5079

36:18 Wherefore I poured 8210-4 my fury 2534 upon them for the blood 1818 that they had shed 8210-1 upon the land, 776 and for their idols 1544 [wherewith] they had polluted 2930-14 it:

36:19 And I scattered 6327-55 them among the heathen, 1471 and they were dispersed 2219-11 through the countries: 776 according to their way 1870 and according to their doings 5949 I judged 8199-1 them.

36:20 And when they entered 935-4 unto the heathen, 1471 whither they went, 935-1 they profaned 2490-17 my holy 6944 name, 8034 when they said 559-2 to them, These [are] the people 5971 of the LORD, 3068 and are gone forth 3318-1 out of his land. 776

36:21 But I had pity 2550-4 for mine holy 6944 name, 8034 which the house 1004 of Israel 3478 had profaned 2490-14 among the heathen, 1471 whither they went. 935-1

36:22 Therefore say 559-3 unto the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 I do 6213-6 not [this] for your sakes, O house 1004 of Israel, 3478 but for mine holy 6944 name's 8034 sake, which ye have profaned 2490-14 among the heathen, 1471 whither ye went. 935-1

36:23 And I will sanctify 6942-14 my great 1419 name, 8034 which was profaned 2490-30 among the heathen, 1471 which ye have profaned 2490-14 in the midst 8432 of them; and the heathen 1471 shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 when I shall be sanctified 6942-9 in you before their eyes. 5869

36:24 For I will take 3947-1 you from among 4480 the heathen, 1471 and gather 6908-14 you out of all countries, 776 and will bring 935-52 you into your own land. 127

36:25 Then will I sprinkle 2236-1 clean 2889 water 4325 upon you, and ye shall be clean: 2891-1 from all your filthiness, 2932 and from all your idols, 1544 will I cleanse 2891-17 you.

36:26 A new 2319 heart 3820 also will I give 5414-1 you, and a new 2319 spirit 7307 will I put 5414-4 within 7130 you: and I will take away 5493-52 the stony 68 heart 3820 out of your flesh, 1320 and I will give 5414-1 you an heart 3820 of flesh. 1320

36:27 And I will put 5414-4 my spirit 7307 within 7130 you, and cause 6213-1 you to walk 3212-4 in my statutes, 2706 and ye shall keep 8104-4 my judgments, 4941 and do 6213-1 [them].

36:28 And ye shall dwell 3427-1 in the land 776 that I gave 5414-1 to your fathers; 1 and ye shall be my people, 5971 and I will be your God. 430

36:29 I will also save 3467-52 you from all your uncleannesses: 2932 and I will call 7121-1 for the corn, 1715 and will increase 7235-52 it, and lay 5414-4 no famine 7458 upon you.

36:30 And I will multiply 7235-52 the fruit 6529 of the tree, 6086 and the increase 8570 of the field, 7704 that ye shall receive 3947-4 no more reproach 2781 of famine 7458 among the heathen. 1471

36:31 Then shall ye remember 2142-1 your own evil 7451 ways, 1870 and your doings 4611 that [were] not good, 2896 and shall lothe 6962-8 yourselves in your own sight 6440 for your iniquities 5771 and for your abominations. 8441

36:32 Not for your sakes do 6213-6 I [this], saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 be it known 3045-11 unto you: be ashamed 954-3 and confounded 3637-10 for your own ways, 1870 O house 1004 of Israel. 3478

36:33 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 In the day 3117 that I shall have cleansed 2891-15 you from all your iniquities 5771 I will also cause [you] to dwell 3427-52 in the cities, 5892 and the wastes 2723 shall be builded. 1129-8

36:34 And the desolate 8074-12 land 776 shall be tilled, 5647-11 whereas it lay desolate 8077 in the sight 5869 of all that passed by. 5674-6

36:35 And they shall say, 559-1 This 1977 land 776 that was desolate 8074-12 is become like the garden 1588 of Eden; 5731 and the waste 2720 and desolate 8074-12 and ruined 2040-12 cities 5892 [are become] fenced, 1219-7 [and] are inhabited. 3427-1

36:36 Then the heathen 1471 that are left 7604-11 round about 5439 you shall know 3045-1 that I the LORD 3068 build 1129-1 the ruined 2040-12 [places, and] plant 5193-1 that that was desolate: 8074-12 I the LORD 3068 have spoken 1696-14 [it], and I will do 6213-1 [it].

36:37 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 I will yet [for] this be enquired 1875-11 of by the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 to do 6213-2 [it] for them; I will increase 7235-55 them with men 120 like a flock. 6629

36:38 As the holy 6944 flock, 6629 as the flock 6629 of Jerusalem 3389 in her solemn feasts; 4150 so shall the waste 2720 cities 5892 be filled 4392 with flocks 6629 of men: 120 and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

37:1 The hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 was upon me, and carried me out 3318-55 in the spirit 7307 of the LORD, 3068 and set me down 5117-55 in the midst 8432 of the valley 1237 which [was] full 4392 of bones, 6106

37:2 And caused me to pass 5674-52 by them round about: 5439 5439 and, behold, [there were] very 3966 many 7227 in the open 6440 valley; 1237 and, lo, [they were] very 3966 dry. 3002

37:3 And he said 559-4 unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 can these bones 6106 live? 2421-4 And I answered, 559-4 O Lord 136 GOD, 3069 thou knowest. 3045-1

37:4 Again he said 559-4 unto me, Prophesy 5012-10 upon these bones, 6106 and say 559-1 unto them, O ye dry 3002 bones, 6106 hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD. 3068

37:5 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD 3069 unto these bones; 6106 Behold, I will cause breath 7307 to enter 935-56 into you, and ye shall live: 2421-1

37:6 And I will lay 5414-1 sinews 1517 upon you, and will bring up 5927-52 flesh 1320 upon you, and cover 7159-1 you with skin, 5785 and put 5414-1 breath 7307 in you, and ye shall live; 2421-1 and ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

37:7 So I prophesied 5012-8 as I was commanded: 6680-27 and as I prophesied, 5012-9 there was a noise, 6963 and behold a shaking, 7494 and the bones 6106 came together, 7126-4 bone 6106 to his bone. 6106

37:8 And when I beheld, 7200-1 lo, the sinews 1517 and the flesh 1320 came up 5927-1 upon them, and the skin 5785 covered 7159-4 them above: 4605 but [there was] no breath 7307 in them.

37:9 Then said 559-4 he unto me, Prophesy 5012-10 unto the wind, 7307 prophesy, 5012-10 son 1121 of man, 120 and say 559-1 to the wind, 7307 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Come 935-3 from the four 702 winds, 7307 O breath, 7307 and breathe 5301-3 upon these slain, 2026-7 that they may live. 2421-4

37:10 So I prophesied 5012-98 as he commanded 6680-14 me, and the breath 7307 came 935-4 into them, and they lived, 2421-4 and stood up 5975-4 upon their feet, 7272 an exceeding 3966 3966 great 1419 army. 2428

37:11 Then he said 559-4 unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 these bones 6106 are the whole house 1004 of Israel: 3478 behold, they say, 559-6 Our bones 6106 are dried, 3001-1 and our hope 8615 is lost: 6-1 we are cut off 1504-8 for our parts.

37:12 Therefore prophesy 5012-10 and say 559-1 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, O my people, 5971 I will open 6605-6 your graves, 6913 and cause you to come up 5927-52 out of your graves, 6913 and bring 935-52 you into the land 127 of Israel. 3478

37:13 And ye shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 when I have opened 6605-2 your graves, 6913 O my people, 5971 and brought you up 5927-53 out of your graves, 6913

37:14 And shall put 5414-1 my spirit 7307 in you, and ye shall live, 2421-1 and I shall place 3240-52 you in your own land: 127 then shall ye know 3045-1 that I the LORD 3068 have spoken 1696-14 [it], and performed 6213-1 [it], saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

37:15 The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came again unto me, saying, 559-2

37:16 Moreover, thou son 1121 of man, 120 take 3947-3 thee one 259 stick, 6086 and write 3789-3 upon it, For Judah, 3063 and for the children 1121 of Israel 3478 his companions: 2270 then take 3947-3 another 259 stick, 6086 and write 3789-3 upon it, For Joseph, 3130 the stick 6086 of Ephraim, 669 and [for] all the house 1004 of Israel 3478 his companions: 2270

37:17 And join 7126-16 them one 259 to another 259 into one 259 stick; 6086 and they shall become one 259 in thine hand. 3027

37:18 And when the children 1121 of thy people 5971 shall speak 559-4 unto thee, saying, 559-2 Wilt thou not shew 5046-55 us what thou [meanest] by these?

37:19 Say 1696-16 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I will take 3947-6 the stick 6086 of Joseph, 3130 which [is] in the hand 3027 of Ephraim, 669 and the tribes 7626 of Israel 3478 his fellows, 2270 and will put 5414-1 them with him, [even] with the stick 6086 of Judah, 3063 and make 6213-1 them one 259 stick, 6086 and they shall be one 259 in mine hand. 3027

37:20 And the sticks 6086 whereon thou writest 3789-4 shall be in thine hand 3027 before their eyes. 5869

37:21 And say 1696-16 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I will take 3947-6 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 from among 996 the heathen, 1471 whither they be gone, 1980-1 and will gather 6908-14 them on every side, 5439 and bring 935-52 them into their own land: 127

37:22 And I will make 6213-1 them one 259 nation 1471 in the land 776 upon the mountains 2022 of Israel; 3478 and one 259 king 4428 shall be king 4428 to them all: and they shall be no more 5750 two 8147 nations, 1471 neither shall they be divided 2673-11 into two 8147 kingdoms 4467 any more 5750 at all: 5750

37:23 Neither shall they defile 2930-101 themselves any more with their idols, 1544 nor with their detestable things, 8251 nor with any of their transgressions: 6588 but I will save 3467-52 them out of all their dwellingplaces, 4186 wherein they have sinned, 2398-1 and will cleanse 2891-14 them: so shall they be my people, 5971 and I will be their God. 430

37:24 And David 1732 my servant 5650 [shall be] king 4428 over them; and they all shall have one 259 shepherd: 7462-6 they shall also walk 3212-4 in my judgments, 4941 and observe 8104-4 my statutes, 2708 and do 6213-1 them.

37:25 And they shall dwell 3427-1 in the land 776 that I have given 5414-1 unto Jacob 3290 my servant, 5650 wherein your fathers 1 have dwelt; 3427-1 and they shall dwell 3427-1 therein, [even] they, and their children, 1121 and their children's 1121 children 1121 for ever: 5769 and my servant 5650 David 1732 [shall be] their prince 5387 for 5704 ever. 5769

37:26 Moreover I will make 3772-1 a covenant 1285 of peace 7965 with them; it shall be an everlasting 5769 covenant 1285 with them: and I will place 5414-1 them, and multiply 7235-52 them, and will set 5414-1 my sanctuary 4720 in the midst 8432 of them for evermore. 5769

37:27 My tabernacle 4908 also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, 430 and they shall be my people. 5971

37:28 And the heathen 1471 shall know 3045-1 that I the LORD 3068 do sanctify 6942-18 Israel, 3478 when my sanctuary 4720 shall be in the midst 8432 of them for evermore. 5769

38:1 And the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came unto me, saying, 559-2

38:2 Son 1121 of man, 120 set 7760-3 thy face 6440 against Gog, 1463 the land 776 of Magog, 4031 the chief 7218|7220 prince 5387 of Meshech 4902 and Tubal, 8422 and prophesy 5012-10 against him,

38:3 And say, 559-1 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I [am] against thee, O Gog, 1463 the chief 7218|7220 prince 5387 of Meshech 4902 and Tubal: 8422

38:4 And I will turn thee back, 7725-31 and put 5414-1 hooks 2397 into thy jaws, 3895 and I will bring thee forth, 3318-52 and all thine army, 2428 horses 5483 and horsemen, 6571 all of them clothed 3847-7 with all sorts 4358 [of armour, even] a great 7227 company 6951 [with] bucklers 6793 and shields, 4043 all of them handling 8610-6 swords: 2719

38:5 Persia, 6539 Ethiopia, 3568 and Libya 6316 with them; all of them with shield 4043 and helmet: 3553

38:6 Gomer, 1586 and all his bands; 102 the house 1004 of Togarmah 8425 of the north 6828 quarters, 3411 and all his bands: 102 [and] many 7227 people 5971 with thee.

38:7 Be thou prepared, 3559-10 and prepare 3559-54 for thyself, thou, and all thy company 6951 that are assembled 6950-12 unto thee, and be thou a guard 4929 unto them.

38:8 After many 7227 days 3117 thou shalt be visited: 6485-11 in the latter 319 years 8141 thou shalt come 935-4 into the land 776 [that is] brought back 7725-50 from the sword, 2719 [and is] gathered 6908-30 out of many 7227 people, 5971 against the mountains 2022 of Israel, 3478 which have been always 8548 waste: 2723 but it is brought forth 3318-90 out of the nations, 5971 and they shall dwell 3427-1 safely 983 all of them.

38:9 Thou shalt ascend 5927-1 and come 935-4 like a storm, 7722 thou shalt be like a cloud 6051 to cover 3680-15 the land, 776 thou, and all thy bands, 102 and many 7227 people 5971 with thee.

38:10 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 It shall also come to pass, [that] at the same time 3117 shall things 1697 come 5927-4 into thy mind, 3824 and thou shalt think 2803-1 an evil 7451 thought: 4284

38:11 And thou shalt say, 559-1 I will go up 5927-4 to the land 776 of unwalled villages; 6519 I will go 935-4 to them that are at rest, 8252-6 that dwell 3427-6 safely, 983 all of them dwelling 3427-6 without walls, 2346 and having neither bars 1280 nor gates, 1817

38:12 To take 7997-2 a spoil, 7998 and to take 962-2 a prey; 957 to turn 7725-53 thine hand 3027 upon the desolate places 2723 [that are now] inhabited, 3427-12 and upon the people 5971 [that are] gathered 622-30 out of the nations, 1471 which have gotten 6213-6 cattle 4735 and goods, 7075 that dwell 3427-6 in the midst 2872 of the land. 776

38:13 Sheba, 7614 and Dedan, 1719 and the merchants 5503-6 of Tarshish, 8659 with all the young lions 3715 thereof, shall say 559-4 unto thee, Art thou come 935-6 to take 7997-2 a spoil? 7998 hast thou gathered 6950-52 thy company 6951 to take 962-2 a prey? 957 to carry away 5375-2 silver 3701 and gold, 2091 to take away 3947-2 cattle 4735 and goods, 7075 to take 7997-2 a great 1419 spoil? 7998

38:14 Therefore, son 1121 of man, 120 prophesy 5012-10 and say 559-1 unto Gog, 1463 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 In that day 3117 when my people 5971 of Israel 3478 dwelleth 3427-2 safely, 983 shalt thou not know 3045-4 [it]?

38:15 And thou shalt come 935-1 from thy place 4725 out of the north 6828 parts, 3411 thou, and many 7227 people 5971 with thee, all of them riding 7392-6 upon horses, 5483 a great 1419 company, 6951 and a mighty 7227 army: 2428

38:16 And thou shalt come up 5927-1 against my people 5971 of Israel, 3478 as a cloud 6051 to cover 3680-15 the land; 776 it shall be in the latter 319 days, 3117 and I will bring 935-52 thee against my land, 776 that the heathen 1471 may know 3045-2 me, when I shall be sanctified 6942-9 in thee, O Gog, 1463 before their eyes. 5869

38:17 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 [Art] thou he of whom I have spoken 1696-14 in old 6931 time 3117 by 3027 my servants 5650 the prophets 5030 of Israel, 3478 which prophesied 5012-12 in those days 3117 [many] years 8141 that I would bring 935-53 thee against them?

38:18 And it shall come to pass at the same time 3117 3117 when Gog 1463 shall come 935-2 against the land 127 of Israel, 3478 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 [that] my fury 2534 shall come up 5927-4 in my face. 639

38:19 For in my jealousy 7068 [and] in the fire 784 of my wrath 5678 have I spoken, 1696-14 Surely in that day 3117 there shall be a great 1419 shaking 7494 in the land 127 of Israel; 3478

38:20 So that the fishes 1709 of the sea, 3220 and the fowls 5775 of the heaven, 8064 and the beasts 2416 of the field, 7704 and all creeping things 7431 that creep 7430-6 upon the earth, 127 and all the men 120 that [are] upon the face 6440 of the earth, 127 shall shake 7493-1 at my presence, 6440 and the mountains 2022 shall be thrown down, 2040-8 and the steep places 4095 shall fall, 5307-1 and every wall 2346 shall fall 5307-4 to the ground. 776

38:21 And I will call 7121-1 for a sword 2719 against him throughout all my mountains, 2022 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD: 3069 every man's 376 sword 2719 shall be against his brother. 251

38:22 And I will plead 8199-8 against him with pestilence 1698 and with blood; 1818 and I will rain 4305-55 upon him, and upon his bands, 102 and upon the many 7227 people 5971 that [are] with him, an overflowing 7857-6 rain, 1653 and great hailstones, 417 68 fire, 784 and brimstone. 1614

38:23 Thus will I magnify 1431-98 myself, and sanctify 6942-98 myself; and I will be known 3045-8 in the eyes 5869 of many 7227 nations, 1471 and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

39:1 Therefore, thou son 1121 of man, 120 prophesy 5012-10 against Gog, 1463 and say, 559-1 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Behold, I [am] against thee, O Gog, 1463 the chief 7218|7220 prince 5387 of Meshech 4902 and Tubal: 8422

39:2 And I will turn thee back, 7725-31 and leave but the sixth part 8338-14 of thee, and will cause thee to come up 5927-52 from the north 6828 parts, 3411 and will bring 935-52 thee upon the mountains 2022 of Israel: 3478

39:3 And I will smite 5221-52 thy bow 7198 out of thy left 8040 hand, 3027 and will cause thine arrows 2671 to fall 5307-55 out of thy right 3225 hand. 3027

39:4 Thou shalt fall 5307-4 upon the mountains 2022 of Israel, 3478 thou, and all thy bands, 102 and the people 5971 that [is] with thee: I will give 5414-1 thee unto the ravenous 5861 birds 6833 of every sort, 3671 and [to] the beasts 2416 of the field 7704 to be devoured. 402

39:5 Thou shalt fall 5307-4 upon the open 6440 field: 7704 for I have spoken 1696-14 [it], saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

39:6 And I will send 7971-14 a fire 784 on Magog, 4031 and among them that dwell 3427-6 carelessly 983 in the isles: 339 and they shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD. 3068

39:7 So will I make my holy 6944 name 8034 known 3045-55 in the midst 8432 of my people 5971 Israel; 3478 and I will not [let them] pollute 2490-55 my holy 6944 name 8034 any more: and the heathen 1471 shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD, 3068 the Holy One 6918 in Israel. 3478

39:8 Behold, it is come, 935-1 and it is done, 1961-8 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 this [is] the day 3117 whereof I have spoken. 1696-14

39:9 And they that dwell 3427-6 in the cities 5892 of Israel 3478 shall go forth, 3318-1 and shall set on fire 1197-14 and burn 5400-52 the weapons, 5402 both the shields 4043 and the bucklers, 6793 the bows 7198 and the arrows, 2671 and the handstaves, 3027 4731 and the spears, 7420 and they shall burn 1197-14 them with fire 784 seven 7651 years: 8141

39:10 So that they shall take 5375-4 no wood 6086 out of the field, 7704 neither cut down 2404-4 [any] out of the forests; 3293 for they shall burn 1197-17 the weapons 5402 with fire: 784 and they shall spoil 7997-1 those that spoiled 7997-6 them, and rob 962-1 those that robbed 962-6 them, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

39:11 And it shall come to pass in that day, 3117 [that] I will give 5414-4 unto Gog 1463 a place 4725 there of graves 6913 in Israel, 3478 the valley 1516 of the passengers 5674-6 on the east 6926 of the sea: 3220 and it shall stop 2629-6 the [noses] of the passengers: 5674-6 and there shall they bury 6912-1 Gog 1463 and all his multitude: 1995 and they shall call 7121-1 [it] The valley 1516 of Hamongog. 1995|1463|1996

39:12 And seven 7651 months 2320 shall the house 1004 of Israel 3478 be burying 6912-1 of them, that they may cleanse 2891-15 the land. 776

39:13 Yea, all the people 5971 of the land 776 shall bury 6912-1 [them]; and it shall be to them a renown 8034 the day 3117 that I shall be glorified, 3513-9 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

39:14 And they shall sever out 914-55 men 582 of continual employment, 8548 passing 5674-6 through the land 776 to bury 6912-18 with the passengers 5674-6 those that remain 3498-12 upon the face 6440 of the earth, 776 to cleanse 2891-15 it: after the end 7097 of seven 7651 months 2320 shall they search. 2713-4

39:15 And the passengers 5674-6 [that] pass 5674-1 through the land, 776 when [any] seeth 7200-1 a man's 120 bone, 6106 then shall he set up 1129-1 a sign 6725 by it, 681 till the buriers 6912-18 have buried 6912-1 it in the valley 1516 of Hamongog. 1995|1463|1996

39:16 And also the name 8034 of the city 5892 [shall be] Hamonah. 1997 Thus shall they cleanse 2891-14 the land. 776

39:17 And, thou son 1121 of man, 120 thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Speak 559-3 unto every feathered 3671 fowl, 6833 and to every beast 2416 of the field, 7704 Assemble 6908-10 yourselves, and come; 935-3 gather 622-10 yourselves on every side 5439 to my sacrifice 2077 that I do sacrifice 2076-6 for you, [even] a great 1419 sacrifice 2077 upon the mountains 2022 of Israel, 3478 that ye may eat 398-1 flesh, 1320 and drink 8354-1 blood. 1818

39:18 Ye shall eat 398-4 the flesh 1320 of the mighty, 1368 and drink 8354-4 the blood 1818 of the princes 5387 of the earth, 776 of rams, 352 of lambs, 3733 and of goats, 6260 of bullocks, 6499 all of them fatlings 4806 of Bashan. 1316

39:19 And ye shall eat 398-1 fat 2459 till ye be full, 7654 and drink 8354-1 blood 1818 till ye be drunken, 7943 of my sacrifice 2077 which I have sacrificed 2076-1 for you.

39:20 Thus ye shall be filled 7646-1 at my table 7979 with horses 5483 and chariots, 7393 with mighty men, 1368 and with all men 376 of war, 4421 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

39:21 And I will set 5414-1 my glory 3519 among the heathen, 1471 and all the heathen 1471 shall see 7200-1 my judgment 4941 that I have executed, 6213-1 and my hand 3027 that I have laid 7760-1 upon them.

39:22 So the house 1004 of Israel 3478 shall know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD 3068 their God 430 from that day 3117 and forward. 1973

39:23 And the heathen 1471 shall know 3045-1 that the house 1004 of Israel 3478 went into captivity 1540-1 for their iniquity: 5771 because they trespassed 4603-1 against me, therefore hid 5641-55 I my face 6440 from them, and gave 5414-4 them into the hand 3027 of their enemies: 6862 so fell 5307-4 they all by the sword. 2719

39:24 According to their uncleanness 2932 and according to their transgressions 6588 have I done 6213-1 unto them, and hid 5641-55 my face 6440 from them.

39:25 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Now will I bring again 7725-55 the captivity 7622|7622-k of Jacob, 3290 and have mercy 7355-14 upon the whole house 1004 of Israel, 3478 and will be jealous 7065-14 for my holy 6944 name; 8034

39:26 After that they have borne 5375-1 their shame, 3639 and all their trespasses 4604 whereby they have trespassed 4603-1 against me, when they dwelt 3427-2 safely 983 in their land, 127 and none made [them] afraid. 2729-56

39:27 When I have brought them again 7725-32 from the people, 5971 and gathered 6908-14 them out of their enemies' 341-6 lands, 776 and am sanctified 6942-8 in them in the sight 5869 of many 7227 nations; 1471

39:28 Then shall they know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD 3068 their God, 430 which caused them to be led into captivity 1540-53 among the heathen: 1471 but I have gathered 3664-14 them unto their own land, 127 and have left 3498-55 none of them any more there.

39:29 Neither will I hide 5641-55 my face 6440 any more from them: for I have poured out 8210-1 my spirit 7307 upon the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

40:1 In the five 2568 and twentieth 6242 year 8141 of our captivity, 1546 in the beginning 7218 of the year, 8141 in the tenth 6218 [day] of the month, 2320 in the fourteenth 702 6240 year 8141 after 310 that the city 5892 was smitten, 5221-90 in the selfsame 6106 day 3117 the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 was upon me, and brought 935-55 me thither.

40:2 In the visions 4759 of God 430 brought 935-52 he me into the land 776 of Israel, 3478 and set 5117-55 me upon a very 3966 high 1364 mountain, 2022 by which [was] as the frame 4011 of a city 5892 on the south. 5045

40:3 And he brought 935-55 me thither, and, behold, [there was] a man, 376 whose appearance 4758 [was] like the appearance 4758 of brass, 5178 with a line 6616 of flax 6593 in his hand, 3027 and a measuring 4060 reed; 7070 and he stood 5975-6 in the gate. 8179

40:4 And the man 376 said 1696-17 unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 behold 7200-3 with thine eyes, 5869 and hear 8085-3 with thine ears, 241 and set 7760-3 thine heart 3820 upon all that I shall shew 7200-56 thee; for to the intent 4616 that I might shew 7200-53 [them] unto thee [art] thou brought 935-90 hither: declare 5046-54 all that thou seest 7200-6 to the house 1004 of Israel. 3478

40:5 And behold a wall 2346 on the outside 2351 of the house 1004 round about, 5439 5439 and in the man's 376 hand 3027 a measuring 4060 reed 7070 of six 8337 cubits 520 [long] by the cubit 520 and an hand breadth: 2948 so he measured 4058-4 the breadth 7341 of the building, 1146 one 259 reed; 7070 and the height, 6967 one 259 reed. 7070

40:6 Then came 935-4 he unto the gate 8179 which looketh 6440 toward 1870 the east, 6921 and went up 5927-4 the stairs 4609 thereof, and measured 4058-4 the threshold 5592 of the gate, 8179 [which was] one 259 reed 7070 broad; 7341 and the other 259 threshold 5592 [of the gate, which was] one 259 reed 7070 broad. 7341

40:7 And [every] little chamber 8372 [was] one 259 reed 7070 long, 753 and one 259 reed 7070 broad; 7341 and between the little chambers 8372 [were] five 2568 cubits; 520 and the threshold 5592 of the gate 8179 by 681 the porch 197 of the gate 8179 within 1004 [was] one 259 reed. 7070

40:8 He measured 4058-4 also the porch 197 of the gate 8179 within, 1004 one 259 reed. 7070

40:9 Then measured 4058-4 he the porch 197 of the gate, 8179 eight 8083 cubits; 520 and the posts 352 thereof, two 8147 cubits; 520 and the porch 197 of the gate 8179 [was] inward. 1004

40:10 And the little chambers 8372 of the gate 8179 eastward 1870 6921 [were] three 7969 on this side, 6311 and three 7969 on that side; 6311 they three 7969 [were] of one 259 measure: 4060 and the posts 352 had one 259 measure 4060 on this side and on that side.

40:11 And he measured 4058-4 the breadth 7341 of the entry 6607 of the gate, 8179 ten 6235 cubits; 520 [and] the length 753 of the gate, 8179 thirteen 7969 6240 cubits. 520

40:12 The space 1366 also before 6440 the little chambers 8372 [was] one 259 cubit 520 [on this side], and the space 1366 [was] one 259 cubit 520 on that side: and the little chambers 8372 [were] six 8337 cubits 520 on this side, and six 8337 cubits 520 on that side.

40:14 He made 6213-4 also posts 352 of threescore 8346 cubits, 520 even unto the post 352 of the court 2691 round about 5439 the gate. 8179

40:15 And from the face 6440 of the gate 8179 of the entrance 2978-q unto the face 6440 of the porch 197 of the inner 6442 gate 8179 [were] fifty 2572 cubits. 520

40:16 And [there were] narrow 331-5 windows 2474 to the little chambers, 8372 and to their posts 352 within 6441 the gate 8179 round about, 5439 5439 and likewise to the arches: 361 and windows 2474 [were] round about 5439 5439 inward: 6441 and upon [each] post 352 [were] palm trees. 8561

40:17 Then brought 935-55 he me into the outward 2435 court, 2691 and, lo, [there were] chambers, 3957 and a pavement 7531 made 6213-7 for the court 2691 round about: 5439 5439 thirty 7970 chambers 3957 [were] upon the pavement. 7531

40:18 And the pavement 7531 by the side 3802 of the gates 8179 over against 5980 the length 753 of the gates 8179 [was] the lower 8481 pavement. 7531

40:45 And he said 1696-17 unto me, This 2090 chamber, 3957 whose prospect 6440 [is] toward 1870 the south, 1864 [is] for the priests, 3548 the keepers 8104-6 of the charge 4931 of the house. 1004

40:47 So he measured 4058-4 the court, 2691 an hundred 3967 cubits 520 long, 753 and an hundred 3967 cubits 520 broad, 7341 foursquare; 7251-30 and the altar 4196 [that was] before 6440 the house. 1004

41:2 And the breadth 7341 of the door 6607 [was] ten 6235 cubits; 520 and the sides 3802 of the door 6607 [were] five 2568 cubits 520 on the one side, and five 2568 cubits 520 on the other side: and he measured 4058-4 the length 753 thereof, forty 705 cubits: 520 and the breadth, 7341 twenty 6242 cubits. 520

41:3 Then went he 935-1 inward, 6441 and measured 4058-4 the post 352 of the door, 6607 two 8147 cubits; 520 and the door, 6607 six 8337 cubits; 520 and the breadth 7341 of the door, 6607 seven 7651 cubits. 520

41:4 So he measured 4058-4 the length 753 thereof, twenty 6242 cubits; 520 and the breadth, 7341 twenty 6242 cubits, 520 before 6440 the temple: 1964 and he said 559-4 unto me, This [is] the most 6944 holy 6944 [place].

41:5 After he measured 4058-4 the wall 7023 of the house, 1004 six 8337 cubits; 520 and the breadth 7341 of [every] side chamber, 6763 four 702 cubits, 520 round about 5439 5439 the house 1004 on every side. 5439

41:6 And the side chambers 6763 [were] three, 7969 one over another, 6763 6763 and thirty 7970 in order; 6471 and they entered 935-6 into the wall 7023 which [was] of the house 1004 for the side chambers 6763 round about, 5439 5439 that they might have hold, 270-7 but they had not hold 270-7 in the wall 7023 of the house. 1004

41:7 And [there was] an enlarging, 7337-1 and a winding about 5437-8 still upward 4605 to the side chambers: 6763 for the winding about 4141 of the house 1004 went still upward 4605 round about 5439 5439 the house: 1004 therefore the breadth 7341 of the house 1004 [was still] upward, 4605 and so increased 5927-4 [from] the lowest 8481 [chamber] to the highest 5945 by the midst. 8484

41:8 I saw 7200-1 also the height 1363 of the house 1004 round about: 5439 5439 the foundations 4328 of the side chambers 6763 [were] a full 4393 reed 7070 of six 8337 great 679 cubits. 520

41:9 The thickness 7341 of the wall, 7023 which [was] for the side chamber 6763 without, 2351 [was] five 2568 cubits: 520 and [that] which [was] left 3240-94 [was] the place 1004 of the side chambers 6763 that [were] within. 1004

41:10 And between the chambers 3957 [was] the wideness 7341 of twenty 6242 cubits 520 round about 5439 the house 1004 on every side. 5439 5439

41:11 And the doors 6607 of the side chambers 6763 [were] toward [the place that was] left, 3240-94 one 259 door 6607 toward 1870 the north, 6828 and another 259 door 6607 toward the south: 1864 and the breadth 7341 of the place 4725 that was left 3240-94 [was] five 2568 cubits 520 round about. 5439 5439

41:12 Now the building 1146 that [was] before 6440 the separate place 1508 at the end 6285 toward 1870 the west 3220 [was] seventy 7657 cubits 520 broad; 7341 and the wall 7023 of the building 1146 [was] five 2568 cubits 520 thick 7341 round about, 5439 5439 and the length 753 thereof ninety 8673 cubits. 520

41:13 So he measured 4058-1 the house, 1004 an hundred 3967 cubits 520 long; 753 and the separate place, 1508 and the building, 1140 with the walls 7023 thereof, an hundred 3967 cubits 520 long; 753

41:14 Also the breadth 7341 of the face 6440 of the house, 1004 and of the separate place 1508 toward the east, 6921 an hundred 3967 cubits. 520

41:15 And he measured 4058-1 the length 753 of the building 1146 over against 6440 the separate place 1508 which [was] behind 310 it, and the galleries 862 thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred 3967 cubits, 520 with the inner 6442 temple, 1964 and the porches 197 of the court; 2691

41:16 The door posts, 5592 and the narrow 331-5 windows, 2474 and the galleries 862 round about 5439 on their three 7969 stories, over against 5048 the door, 5592 cieled 7824 with wood 6086 round about, 5439 5439 and from the ground 776 up to the windows, 2474 and the windows 2474 [were] covered; 3680-30

41:17 To that above the door, 6607 even unto the inner 6442 house, 1004 and without, 2351 and by all the wall 7023 round about 5439 5439 within 6442 and without, 2435 by measure. 4060

41:18 And [it was] made 6213-7 with cherubims 3742 and palm trees, 8561 so that a palm tree 8561 [was] between a cherub 3742 and a cherub; 3742 and [every] cherub 3742 had two 8147 faces; 6440

41:19 So that the face 6440 of a man 120 [was] toward the palm tree 8561 on the one side, and the face 6440 of a young lion 3715 toward the palm tree 8561 on the other side: [it was] made 6213-7 through all the house 1004 round about. 5439 5439

41:20 From the ground 776 unto above the door 6607 [were] cherubims 3742 and palm trees 8561 made, 6213-7 and [on] the wall 7023 of the temple. 1964

41:21 The posts 4201 of the temple 1964 [were] squared, 7251-7 [and] the face 6440 of the sanctuary; 6944 the appearance 4758 [of the one] as the appearance 4758 [of the other].

41:22 The altar 4196 of wood 6086 [was] three 7969 cubits 520 high, 1364 and the length 753 thereof two 8147 cubits; 520 and the corners 4740 thereof, and the length 753 thereof, and the walls 7023 thereof, [were] of wood: 6086 and he said 1696-17 unto me, This [is] the table 7979 that [is] before 6440 the LORD. 3068

41:23 And the temple 1964 and the sanctuary 6944 had two 8147 doors. 1817

41:24 And the doors 1817 had two 8147 leaves 1817 [apiece], two 8147 turning 4142-94 leaves; 1817 two 8147 [leaves] for the one 259 door, 1817 and two 8147 leaves 1817 for the other 312 [door].

41:25 And [there were] made 6213-7 on them, on the doors 1817 of the temple, 1964 cherubims 3742 and palm trees, 8561 like as [were] made 6213-7 upon the walls; 7023 and [there were] thick 5646 planks 6086 upon the face 6440 of the porch 197 without. 2351

41:26 And [there were] narrow 331-5 windows 2474 and palm trees 8561 on the one side and on the other side, on the sides 3802 of the porch, 197 and [upon] the side chambers 6763 of the house, 1004 and thick planks. 5646

42:1 Then he brought me forth 3318-55 into the utter 2435 court, 2691 the way 1870 toward 1870 the north: 6828 and he brought 935-55 me into the chamber 3957 that [was] over against the separate place, 1508 and which [was] before the building 1146 toward the north. 6828

42:2 Before 6440 the length 753 of an hundred 3967 cubits 520 [was] the north 6828 door, 6607 and the breadth 7341 [was] fifty 2572 cubits. 520

42:3 Over against the twenty 6242 [cubits] which [were] for the inner 6442 court, 2691 and over against the pavement 7531 which [was] for the utter 2435 court, 2691 [was] gallery 862 against 6440 gallery 862 in three 7992 [stories].

42:4 And before 6440 the chambers 3957 [was] a walk 4109 of ten 6235 cubits 520 breadth 7341 inward, 6442 a way 1870 of one 259 cubit; 520 and their doors 6607 toward the north. 6828

42:5 Now the upper 5945 chambers 3957 [were] shorter: 7114-7 for the galleries 862 were higher 398-4 than these, 2007 than the lower, 8481 and than the middlemost 8484 of the building. 1146

42:6 For they [were] in three 8027-30 [stories], but had not pillars 5982 as the pillars 5982 of the courts: 2691 therefore [the building] was straitened 680-8 more than the lowest 8481 and the middlemost 8484 from the ground. 776

42:7 And the wall 1447 that [was] without 2351 over against 5980 the chambers, 3957 toward 1870 the utter 2435 court 2691 on the forepart 6440 of the chambers, 3957 the length 753 thereof [was] fifty 2572 cubits. 520

42:8 For the length 753 of the chambers 3957 that [were] in the utter 2435 court 2691 [was] fifty 2572 cubits: 520 and, lo, before 6440 the temple 1964 [were] an hundred 3967 cubits. 520

42:9 And from under these chambers 3957 [was] the entry 3996|935-56-q on the east 6921 side, as one goeth 935-2 into them 2007 from the utter 2435 court. 2691

42:10 The chambers 3957 [were] in the thickness 7341 of the wall 1444 of the court 2691 toward 1870 the east, 6921 over against 6440 the separate place, 1508 and over against 6440 the building. 1146

42:11 And the way 1870 before 6440 them [was] like the appearance 4758 of the chambers 3957 which [were] toward 1870 the north, 6828 as long as 753 they, [and] as 3651 broad as 3651 7341 they: and all their goings out 4161 [were] both according to their fashions, 4941 and according to their doors. 6607

42:12 And according to the doors 6607 of the chambers 3957 that [were] toward 1870 the south 1864 [was] a door 6607 in the head 7218 of the way, 1870 [even] the way 1870 directly 1903 before 6440 the wall 1448 toward 1870 the east, 6921 as one entereth into 935-2 them.

42:13 Then said 559-4 he unto me, The north 6828 chambers 3957 [and] the south 1864 chambers, 3957 which [are] before 6440 the separate place, 1508 they [be] holy 6944 chambers, 3957 where the priests 3548 that approach 7138 unto the LORD 3068 shall eat 398-4 the most 6944 holy things: 6944 there shall they lay 3240-55 the most 6944 holy things, 6944 and the meat offering, 4503 and the sin offering, 2403 and the trespass offering; 817 for the place 4725 [is] holy. 6918

42:14 When the priests 3548 enter 935-2 therein, then shall they not go out 3318-4 of the holy 6944 [place] into the utter 2435 court, 2691 but there they shall lay 3240-55 their garments 899 wherein they minister; 8334-17 for they [are] holy; 6944 and shall put on 3847-1|3847-4-k other 312 garments, 899 and shall approach 7126-1 to [those things] which [are] for the people. 5971

42:15 Now when he had made an end 3615-14 of measuring 4060 the inner 6442 house, 1004 he brought me forth 3318-52 toward 1870 the gate 8179 whose prospect 6440 [is] toward 1870 the east, 6921 and measured 4058-1 it round about. 5439 5439

42:16 He measured 4058-1 the east 6921 side 7307 with the measuring 4060 reed, 7070 five 2568 hundred 3967|520-k reeds, 7070 with the measuring 4060 reed 7070 round about. 5439

42:17 He measured 4058-1 the north 6828 side, 7307 five 2568 hundred 3967 reeds, 7070 with the measuring 4060 reed 7070 round about. 5439

42:18 He measured 4058-1 the south 1864 side, 7307 five 2568 hundred 3967 reeds, 7070 with the measuring 4060 reed. 7070

42:19 He turned about 5437-1 to the west 3220 side, 7307 [and] measured 4058-1 five 2568 hundred 3967 reeds 7070 with the measuring 4060 reed. 7070

42:20 He measured 4058-1 it by the four 702 sides: 7307 it had a wall 2346 round about, 5439 5439 five 2568 hundred 3967 [reeds] long, 753 and five 2568 hundred 3967 broad, 7341 to make a separation 914-53 between the sanctuary 6944 and the profane 2455 place.

43:1 Afterward he brought 3212-55 me to the gate, 8179 [even] the gate 8179 that looketh 6437-6 toward 1870 the east: 6921

43:2 And, behold, the glory 3519 of the God 430 of Israel 3478 came 935-1 from the way 1870 of the east: 6921 and his voice 6963 [was] like a noise 6963 of many 7227 waters: 4325 and the earth 776 shined 215-52 with his glory. 3519

43:3 And [it was] according to the appearance 4758 of the vision 4758 which I saw, 7200-1 [even] according to the vision 4758 that I saw 7200-1 when I came 935-2 to destroy 7843-15 the city: 5892 and the visions 4759 [were] like the vision 4758 that I saw 7200-1 by the river 5104 Chebar; 3529 and I fell 5307-4 upon my face. 6440

43:4 And the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 came 935-1 into the house 1004 by the way 1870 of the gate 8179 whose prospect 6440 [is] toward 1870 the east. 6921

43:5 So the spirit 7307 took me up, 5375-4 and brought 935-55 me into the inner 6442 court; 2691 and, behold, the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 filled 4390-1 the house. 1004

43:6 And I heard 8085-4 [him] speaking 1696-102 unto me out of the house; 1004 and the man 376 stood 5975-6 by me. 681

43:7 And he said 559-4 unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 the place 4725 of my throne, 3678 and the place 4725 of the soles 3709 of my feet, 7272 where I will dwell 7931-4 in the midst 8432 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 for ever, 5769 and my holy 6944 name, 8034 shall the house 1004 of Israel 3478 no more defile, 2930-17 [neither] they, nor their kings, 4428 by their whoredom, 2184 nor by the carcases 6297 of their kings 4428 in their high places. 1116

43:8 In their setting 5414-2 of their threshold 5592 by my thresholds, 5592 and their post 4201 by 681 my posts, 4201 and the wall 7023 between me and them, they have even defiled 2930-14 my holy 6944 name 8034 by their abominations 8441 that they have committed: 6213-1 wherefore I have consumed 3615-17 them in mine anger. 639

43:9 Now let them put away their whoredom, 2184 and the carcases 6297 of their kings, 4428 far 7368-17 from me, and I will dwell 7931-1 in the midst 8432 of them for ever. 5769

43:10 Thou son 1121 of man, 120 shew 5046-54 the house 1004 to the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 that they may be ashamed 3637-11 of their iniquities: 5771 and let them measure 4058-1 the pattern. 8508

43:11 And if they be ashamed 3637-8 of all that they have done, 6213-1 shew 3045-54 them the form 6699 of the house, 1004 and the fashion 8498 thereof, and the goings out 4161 thereof, and the comings 4126 in thereof, and all the forms 6699 thereof, and all the ordinances 2708 thereof, and all the forms 6699 thereof, and all the laws 8451 thereof: and write 3789-3 [it] in their sight, 5869 that they may keep 8104-4 the whole form 6699 thereof, and all the ordinances 2708 thereof, and do 6213-1 them.

43:12 This [is] the law 8451 of the house; 1004 Upon the top 7218 of the mountain 2022 the whole limit 1366 thereof round about 5439 5439 [shall be] most 6944 holy. 6944 Behold, this [is] the law 8451 of the house. 1004

43:13 And these [are] the measures 4060 of the altar 4196 after the cubits: 520 The cubit 520 [is] a cubit 520 and an hand breadth; 2948 even the bottom 2436 [shall be] a cubit, 520 and the breadth 7341 a cubit, 520 and the border 1366 thereof by the edge 8193 thereof round about 5439 [shall be] a 259 span: 2239 and this [shall be] the higher place 1354 of the altar. 4196

43:14 And from the bottom 2436 [upon] the ground 776 [even] to the lower 8481 settle 5835 [shall be] two 8147 cubits, 520 and the breadth 7341 one 259 cubit; 520 and from the lesser 6996 settle 5835 [even] to the greater 1419 settle 5835 [shall be] four 702 cubits, 520 and the breadth 7341 [one] cubit. 520

43:15 So the altar 741 2025 [shall be] four 702 cubits; 520 and from the altar 741 and upward 4605 [shall be] four 702 horns. 7161

43:16 And the altar 741 [shall be] twelve 8147 6240 [cubits] long, 753 twelve 8147 6240 broad, 7341 square 7251-7 in the four 702 squares 7253 thereof.

43:17 And the settle 5835 [shall be] fourteen 702 6240 [cubits] long 753 and fourteen 702 6240 broad 7341 in the four 702 squares 7253 thereof; and the border 1366 about 5439 it [shall be] half 2677 a cubit; 520 and the bottom 2436 thereof [shall be] a cubit 520 about; 5439 and his stairs 4609 shall look 6437-2 toward the east. 6921

43:18 And he said 559-4 unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 These [are] the ordinances 2708 of the altar 4196 in the day 3117 when they shall make 6213-9 it, to offer 5927-53 burnt offerings 5930 thereon, and to sprinkle 2236-2 blood 1818 thereon.

43:19 And thou shalt give 5414-1 to the priests 3548 the Levites 3881 that be of the seed 2233 of Zadok, 6659 which approach 7138 unto me, to minister 8334-15 unto me, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 a young 6499 1121 bullock 1241 for a sin offering. 2403

43:20 And thou shalt take 3947-1 of the blood 1818 thereof, and put 5414-1 [it] on the four 702 horns 7161 of it, and on the four 702 corners 6438 of the settle, 5835 and upon the border 1366 round about: 5439 thus shalt thou cleanse 2398-14 and purge 3722-14 it.

43:21 Thou shalt take 3947-1 the bullock 6499 also of the sin offering, 2403 and he shall burn 8313-1 it in the appointed place 4662 of the house, 1004 without 2351 the sanctuary. 4720

43:22 And on the second 8145 day 3117 thou shalt offer 7126-55 a kid 8163 of the goats 5795 without blemish 8549 for a sin offering; 2403 and they shall cleanse 2398-14 the altar, 4196 as they did cleanse 2398-14 [it] with the bullock. 6499

43:23 When thou hast made an end 3615-15 of cleansing 2398-15 [it], thou shalt offer 7126-55 a young 6499 1121 bullock 1241 without blemish, 8549 and a ram 352 out of the flock 6629 without blemish. 8549

43:24 And thou shalt offer 7126-52 them before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and the priests 3548 shall cast 7993-52 salt 4417 upon them, and they shall offer them up 5927-52 [for] a burnt offering 5930 unto the LORD. 3068

43:25 Seven 7651 days 3117 shalt thou prepare 6213-4 every day 3117 a goat 8163 [for] a sin offering: 2403 they shall also prepare 6213-4 a young 6499 1121 bullock, 1241 and a ram 352 out of the flock, 6629 without blemish. 8549

43:26 Seven 7651 days 3117 shall they purge 3722-17 the altar 4196 and purify 2891-14 it; and they shall consecrate themselves. 4390-14 3027

43:27 And when these days 3117 are expired, 3615-17 it shall be, [that] upon the eighth 8066 day, 3117 and [so] forward, 1973 the priests 3548 shall make 6213-4 your burnt offerings 5930 upon the altar, 4196 and your peace offerings; 8002 and I will accept 7521-1 you, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

44:1 Then he brought me back 7725-55 the way 1870 of the gate 8179 of the outward 2435 sanctuary 4720 which looketh 6437-6 toward the east; 6921 and it [was] shut. 5462-7

44:2 Then said 559-4 the LORD 3068 unto me; This gate 8179 shall be shut, 5462-7 it shall not be opened, 6605-11 and no man 376 shall enter in 935-4 by it; because the LORD, 3068 the God 430 of Israel, 3478 hath entered in 935-1 by it, therefore it shall be shut. 5462-7

44:3 [It is] for the prince; 5387 the prince, 5387 he shall sit 3427-4 in it to eat 398-2 bread 3899 before 6440 the LORD; 3068 he shall enter 935-4 by the way 1870 of the porch 197 of [that] gate, 8179 and shall go out 3318-4 by the way 1870 of the same.

44:4 Then brought 935-55 he me the way 1870 of the north 6828 gate 8179 before 6440 the house: 1004 and I looked, 7200-4 and, behold, the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 filled 4390-1 the house 1004 of the LORD: 3068 and I fell 5307-4 upon my face. 6440

44:5 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 mark 7760-3 well, 3820 and behold 7200-3 with thine eyes, 5869 and hear 8085-3 with thine ears 241 all that I say 1696-18 unto thee concerning all the ordinances 2708 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and all the laws 8451 thereof; and mark 7760-1 well 3820 the entering in 3996 of the house, 1004 with every going forth 4161 of the sanctuary. 4720

44:6 And thou shalt say 559-1 to the rebellious, 4805 [even] to the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 O ye house 1004 of Israel, 3478 let it suffice 7227 you of all your abominations, 8441

44:7 In that ye have brought 935-53 [into my sanctuary] strangers, 1121 5236 uncircumcised 6189 in heart, 3820 and uncircumcised 6189 in flesh, 1320 to be in my sanctuary, 4720 to pollute 2490-15 it, [even] my house, 1004 when ye offer 7126-53 my bread, 3899 the fat 2459 and the blood, 1818 and they have broken 6565-55 my covenant 1285 because 413 of all your abominations. 8441

44:8 And ye have not kept 8104-1 the charge 4931 of mine holy things: 6944 but ye have set 7760-4 keepers 8104-6 of my charge 4931 in my sanctuary 4720 for yourselves.

44:9 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 No stranger, 1121 5236 uncircumcised 6189 in heart, 3820 nor uncircumcised 6189 in flesh, 1320 shall enter 935-4 into my sanctuary, 4720 of any stranger 1121 5236 that [is] among 8432 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

44:10 And the Levites 3881 that are gone away far 7368-1 from me, when Israel 3478 went astray, 8582-2 which went astray away 8582-1 from me after 310 their idols; 1544 they shall even bear 5375-1 their iniquity. 5771

44:11 Yet they shall be ministers 8334-18 in my sanctuary, 4720 [having] charge 6486 at the gates 8179 of the house, 1004 and ministering 8334-18 to the house: 1004 they shall slay 7819-4 the burnt offering 5930 and the sacrifice 2077 for the people, 5971 and they shall stand 5975-4 before 6440 them to minister 8334-15 unto them.

44:12 Because they ministered 8334-17 unto them before 6440 their idols, 1544 and caused the house 1004 of Israel 3478 to fall 4383 into iniquity; 5771 therefore have I lifted up 5375-1 mine hand 3027 against them, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 and they shall bear 5375-1 their iniquity. 5771

44:13 And they shall not come near 5066-4 unto me, to do the office of a priest 3547-15 unto me, nor to come near 5066-2 to any of my holy things, 6944 in the most 6944 holy 6944 [place]: but they shall bear 5375-1 their shame, 3639 and their abominations 8441 which they have committed. 6213-1

44:14 But I will make 5414-1 them keepers 8104-6 of the charge 4931 of the house, 1004 for all the service 5656 thereof, and for all that shall be done 6213-11 therein.

44:15 But the priests 3548 the Levites, 3881 the sons 1121 of Zadok, 6659 that kept 8104-1 the charge 4931 of my sanctuary 4720 when the children 1121 of Israel 3478 went astray 8582-2 from me, they shall come near 7126-4 to me to minister 8334-15 unto me, and they shall stand 5975-1 before 6440 me to offer 7126-53 unto me the fat 2459 and the blood, 1818 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD: 3069

44:16 They shall enter 935-4 into my sanctuary, 4720 and they shall come near 7126-4 to my table, 7979 to minister 8334-15 unto me, and they shall keep 8104-1 my charge. 4931

44:17 And it shall come to pass, [that] when they enter in 935-2 at the gates 8179 of the inner 6442 court, 2691 they shall be clothed 3847-4 with linen 6593 garments; 899 and no wool 6785 shall come 5927-4 upon them, whiles they minister 8334-15 in the gates 8179 of the inner 6442 court, 2691 and within. 1004

44:18 They shall have linen 6593 bonnets 6287 upon their heads, 7218 and shall have linen 6593 breeches 4370 upon their loins; 4975 they shall not gird 2296-4 [themselves] with any thing that causeth sweat. 3154

44:19 And when they go forth 3318-2 into the utter 2435 court, 2691 [even] into the utter 2435 court 2691 to the people, 5971 they shall put off 6584-4 their garments 899 wherein they ministered, 8334-18 and lay 3240-52 them in the holy 6944 chambers, 3957 and they shall put 3847-1 on other 312 garments; 899 and they shall not sanctify 6942-17 the people 5971 with their garments. 899

44:20 Neither shall they shave 1548-17 their heads, 7218 nor suffer their locks 6545 to grow long; 7971-17 they shall only 3697-2 poll 3697-4 their heads. 7218

44:21 Neither shall any priest 3548 drink 8354-4 wine, 3196 when they enter 935-2 into the inner 6442 court. 2691

44:22 Neither shall they take 3947-4 for their wives 802 a widow, 490 nor her that is put away: 1644-7 but they shall take 3947-4 maidens 1330 of the seed 2233 of the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 or a widow 490 490 that had a priest 3548 before.

44:23 And they shall teach 3384-55 my people 5971 [the difference] between the holy 6944 and profane, 2455 and cause them to discern 3045-55 between the unclean 2931 and the clean. 2889

44:24 And in controversy 7379 they shall stand 5975-4 in judgment; 4941|8199-2-k [and] they shall judge 8199-4 it according to my judgments: 4941 and they shall keep 8104-4 my laws 8451 and my statutes 2708 in all mine assemblies; 4150 and they shall hallow 6942-17 my sabbaths. 7676

44:25 And they shall come 935-4 at no dead 4191-5 person 120 to defile 2930-2 themselves: but for father, 1 or for mother, 517 or for son, 1121 or for daughter, 1323 for brother, 251 or for sister 269 that hath had no husband, 376 they may defile 2930-101 themselves.

44:26 And after 310 he is cleansed, 2893 they shall reckon 5608-4 unto him seven 7651 days. 3117

44:27 And in the day 3117 that he goeth 935-2 into the sanctuary, 6944 unto the inner 6442 court, 2691 to minister 8334-15 in the sanctuary, 6944 he shall offer 7126-55 his sin offering, 2403 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

44:28 And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: 5159 I [am] their inheritance: 5159 and ye shall give 5414-4 them no possession 272 in Israel: 3478 I [am] their possession. 272

44:29 They shall eat 398-4 the meat offering, 4503 and the sin offering, 2403 and the trespass offering; 817 and every dedicated thing 2764 in Israel 3478 shall be theirs.

44:30 And the first 7225 of all the firstfruits 1061 of all [things], and every oblation 8641 of all, of every [sort] of your oblations, 8641 shall be the priest's: 3548 ye shall also give 5414-4 unto the priest 3548 the first 7225 of your dough, 6182 that he may cause the blessing 1293 to rest 5117-53 in thine house. 1004

44:31 The priests 3548 shall not eat 398-4 of any thing that is dead of itself, 5038 or torn, 2966 whether it be fowl 5775 or beast. 929

45:1 Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot 5307-53 the land 776 for inheritance, 5159 ye shall offer 7311-55 an oblation 8641 unto the LORD, 3068 an holy portion 6944 of the land: 776 the length 753 [shall be] the length 753 of five 2568 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 [reeds], and the breadth 7341 [shall be] ten 6235 thousand. 505 This [shall be] holy 6944 in all the borders 1366 thereof round about. 5439

45:2 Of this there shall be for the sanctuary 6944 five 2568 hundred 3967 [in length], with five 2568 hundred 3967 [in breadth], square 7251-30 round about; 5439 and fifty 2572 cubits 520 round about 5439 for the suburbs 4054 thereof.

45:3 And of this measure 4060 shalt thou measure 4058-4 the length 753 of five 2568 and twenty 6242 thousand, 505 and the breadth 7341 of ten 6235 thousand: 505 and in it shall be the sanctuary 4720 [and] the most 6944 holy 6944 [place].

45:4 The holy 6944 [portion] of the land 776 shall be for the priests 3548 the ministers 8334-18 of the sanctuary, 4720 which shall come near 7131 to minister 8334-15 unto the LORD: 3068 and it shall be a place 4725 for their houses, 1004 and an holy place 4720 for the sanctuary. 4720

45:5 And the five 2568 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 of length, 753 and the ten 6235 thousand 505 of breadth, 7341 shall also the Levites, 3881 the ministers 8334-18 of the house, 1004 have for themselves, for a possession 272 for twenty 6242 chambers. 3957

45:6 And ye shall appoint 5414-4 the possession 272 of the city 5892 five 2568 thousand 505 broad, 7341 and five 2568 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 long, 753 over against 5980 the oblation 8641 of the holy 6944 [portion]: it shall be for the whole house 1004 of Israel. 3478

45:7 And a [portion shall be] for the prince 5387 on the one side and on the other side of the oblation 8641 of the holy 6944 [portion], and of the possession 272 of the city, 5892 before 6440 the oblation 8641 of the holy 6944 [portion], and before 6440 the possession 272 of the city, 5892 from the west 3220 side 6285 westward, 3220 and from the east 6924 side 6285 eastward: 6921 and the length 753 [shall be] over against 5980 one 259 of the portions, 2506 from the west 3220 border 1366 unto the east 6921 border. 1366

45:8 In the land 776 shall be his possession 272 in Israel: 3478 and my princes 5387 shall no more oppress 3238-55 my people; 5971 and [the rest of] the land 776 shall they give 5414-4 to the house 1004 of Israel 3478 according to their tribes. 7626

45:9 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 Let it suffice 7227 you, O princes 5387 of Israel: 3478 remove 5493-54 violence 2555 and spoil, 7701 and execute 6213-3 judgment 4941 and justice, 6666 take away 7311-54 your exactions 1646 from my people, 5971 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

45:10 Ye shall have just 6664 balances, 3976 and a just 6664 ephah, 374 and a just 6664 bath. 1324

45:11 The ephah 374 and the bath 1324 shall be of one 259 measure, 8506 that the bath 1324 may contain 5375-2 the tenth part 4643 of an homer, 2563 and the ephah 374 the tenth 6224 part of an homer: 2563 the measure 4971 thereof shall be after the homer. 2563

45:12 And the shekel 8255 [shall be] twenty 6242 gerahs: 1626 twenty 6242 shekels, 8255 five 2568 and twenty 6242 shekels, 8255 fifteen 2568 6235 shekels, 8255 shall be your maneh. 4488

45:13 This [is] the oblation 8641 that ye shall offer; 7311-55 the sixth part 8345 of an ephah 374 of an homer 2563 of wheat, 2406 and ye shall give the sixth part 8341-14 of an ephah 374 of an homer 2563 of barley: 8184

45:14 Concerning the ordinance 2706 of oil, 8081 the bath 1324 of oil, 8081 [ye shall offer] the tenth part 4643 of a bath 1324 out of the cor, 3734 [which is] an homer 2563 of ten 6235 baths; 1324 for ten 6235 baths 1324 [are] an homer: 2563

45:15 And one 259 lamb 7716 out of the flock, 6629 out of two hundred, 3967 out of the fat pastures 4945 of Israel; 3478 for a meat offering, 4503 and for a burnt offering, 5930 and for peace offerings, 8002 to make reconciliation 3722-15 for them, saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

45:16 All the people 5971 of the land 776 shall give this oblation 8641 for the prince 5387 in Israel. 3478

45:17 And it shall be the prince's 5387 part [to give] burnt offerings, 5930 and meat offerings, 4503 and drink offerings, 5262 in the feasts, 2282 and in the new moons, 2320 and in the sabbaths, 7676 in all solemnities 4150 of the house 1004 of Israel: 3478 he shall prepare 6213-4 the sin offering, 2403 and the meat offering, 4503 and the burnt offering, 5930 and the peace offerings, 8002 to make reconciliation 3722-15 for the house 1004 of Israel. 3478

45:18 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 In the first 259 [month], in the first 7223 [day] of the month, 2320 thou shalt take 3947-4 a young 6499 1121 bullock 1241 without blemish, 8549 and cleanse 2398-14 the sanctuary: 4720

45:19 And the priest 3548 shall take 3947-1 of the blood 1818 of the sin offering, 2403 and put 5414-1 [it] upon the posts 4201 of the house, 1004 and upon the four 702 corners 6438 of the settle 5835 of the altar, 4196 and upon the posts 4201 of the gate 8179 of the inner 6442 court. 2691

45:20 And so thou shalt do 6213-4 the seventh 7651 [day] of the month 2320 for every one 376 that erreth, 7686-6 and for [him that is] simple: 6612 so shall ye reconcile 3722-14 the house. 1004

45:21 In the first 7223 [month], in the fourteenth 702 6240 day 3117 of the month, 2320 ye shall have the passover, 6453 a feast 2282 of seven 7620 days; 3117 unleavened bread 4682 shall be eaten. 398-11

45:22 And upon that day 3117 shall the prince 5387 prepare 6213-1 for himself and for all the people 5971 of the land 776 a bullock 6499 [for] a sin offering. 2403

45:23 And seven 7651 days 3117 of the feast 2282 he shall prepare 6213-4 a burnt offering 5930 to the LORD, 3068 seven 7651 bullocks 6499 and seven 7651 rams 352 without blemish 8549 daily 3117 the seven 7651 days; 3117 and a kid 8163 of the goats 5795 daily 3117 [for] a sin offering. 2403

45:24 And he shall prepare 6213-4 a meat offering 4503 of an ephah 374 for a bullock, 6499 and an ephah 374 for a ram, 352 and an hin 1969 of oil 8081 for an ephah. 374

45:25 In the seventh 7637 [month], in the fifteenth 2568 6240 day 3117 of the month, 2320 shall he do 6213-4 the like in the feast 2282 of the seven 7651 days, 3117 according to the sin offering, 2403 according to the burnt offering, 5930 and according to the meat offering, 4503 and according to the oil. 8081

46:1 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 The gate 8179 of the inner 6442 court 2691 that looketh 6437-6 toward the east 6921 shall be shut 5462-7 the six 8337 working 4639 days; 3117 but on the sabbath 7676 3117 it shall be opened, 6605-11 and in the day 3117 of the new moon 2320 it shall be opened. 6605-11

46:2 And the prince 5387 shall enter 935-1 by the way 1870 of the porch 197 of [that] gate 8179 without, 2351 and shall stand 5975-1 by the post 4201 of the gate, 8179 and the priests 3548 shall prepare 6213-1 his burnt offering 5930 and his peace offerings, 8002 and he shall worship 7812-98 at the threshold 4670 of the gate: 8179 then he shall go forth; 3318-1 but the gate 8179 shall not be shut 5462-11 until the evening. 6153

46:3 Likewise the people 5971 of the land 776 shall worship 7812-98 at the door 6607 of this gate 8179 before 6440 the LORD 3068 in the sabbaths 7676 and in the new moons. 2320

46:4 And the burnt offering 5930 that the prince 5387 shall offer 7126-55 unto the LORD 3068 in the sabbath 7676 day 3117 [shall be] six 8337 lambs 3532 without blemish, 8549 and a ram 352 without blemish. 8549

46:5 And the meat offering 4503 [shall be] an ephah 374 for a ram, 352 and the meat offering 4503 for the lambs 3532 as he shall be able 3027 to give, 4991 and an hin 1969 of oil 8081 to an ephah. 374

46:6 And in the day 3117 of the new moon 2320 [it shall be] a young 6499 1121 bullock 1241 without blemish, 8549 and six 8337 lambs, 3532 and a ram: 352 they shall be without blemish. 8549

46:7 And he shall prepare 6213-4 a meat offering, 4503 an ephah 374 for a bullock, 6499 and an ephah 374 for a ram, 352 and for the lambs 3532 according as his hand 3027 shall attain 5381-55 unto, and an hin 1969 of oil 8081 to an ephah. 374

46:8 And when the prince 5387 shall enter, 935-2 he shall go 935-4 in by the way 1870 of the porch 197 of [that] gate, 8179 and he shall go forth 3318-4 by the way 1870 thereof.

46:9 But when the people 5971 of the land 776 shall come 935-2 before 6440 the LORD 3068 in the solemn feasts, 4150 he that entereth in 935-6 by the way 1870 of the north 6828 gate 8179 to worship 7812-99 shall go out 3318-4 by the way 1870 of the south 5045 gate; 8179 and he that entereth 935-6 by the way 1870 of the south 5045 gate 8179 shall go forth 3318-4 by the way 1870 of the north 6828 gate: 8179 he shall not return 7725-4 by the way 1870 of the gate 8179 whereby he came in, 935-1 but shall go forth 3318-4 over against 5226 it.

46:10 And the prince 5387 in the midst 8432 of them, when they go in, 935-2 shall go in; 935-4 and when they go forth, 3318-2 shall go forth. 3318-4

46:11 And in the feasts 2282 and in the solemnities 4150 the meat offering 4503 shall be an ephah 374 to a bullock, 6499 and an ephah 374 to a ram, 352 and to the lambs 3532 as he is able 3027 to give, 4991 and an hin 1969 of oil 8081 to an ephah. 374

46:12 Now when the prince 5387 shall prepare 6213-4 a voluntary 5071 burnt offering 5930 or peace offerings 8002 voluntarily 5071 unto the LORD, 3068 [one] shall then open 6605-1 him the gate 8179 that looketh 6437-6 toward the east, 6921 and he shall prepare 6213-1 his burnt offering 5930 and his peace offerings, 8002 as he did 6213-4 on the sabbath 7676 day: 3117 then he shall go forth; 3318-1 and after 310 his going forth 3318-2 [one] shall shut 5462-1 the gate. 8179

46:13 Thou shalt daily 3117 prepare 6213-4 a burnt offering 5930 unto the LORD 3068 [of] a lamb 3532 of the first 1121 year 8141 without blemish: 8549 thou shalt prepare 6213-4 it every morning. 1242 1242

46:14 And thou shalt prepare 6213-4 a meat offering 4503 for it every morning, 1242 1242 the sixth part 8345 of an ephah, 374 and the third part 7992 of an hin 1969 of oil, 8081 to temper 7450-2 with the fine flour; 5560 a meat offering 4503 continually 8548 by a perpetual 5769 ordinance 2708 unto the LORD. 3068

46:15 Thus shall they prepare 6213-4|6213-1-k the lamb, 3532 and the meat offering, 4503 and the oil, 8081 every morning 1242 1242 [for] a continual 8548 burnt offering. 5930

46:16 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 If the prince 5387 give 5414-4 a gift 4979 unto any 376 of his sons, 1121 the inheritance 5159 thereof shall be his sons'; 1121 it [shall be] their possession 272 by inheritance. 5159

46:17 But if he give 5414-4 a gift 4979 of his inheritance 5159 to one 259 of his servants, 5650 then it shall be his to the year 8141 of liberty; 1865 after it shall return 7725-1 to the prince: 5387 but his inheritance 5159 shall be his sons' 1121 for them.

46:18 Moreover the prince 5387 shall not take 3947-4 of the people's 5971 inheritance 5159 by oppression, 3238-53 to thrust them out of their possession; 272 [but] he shall give his sons 1121 inheritance 5157-55 out of his own possession: 272 that my people 5971 be not scattered 6327-4 every man 376 from his possession. 272

46:19 After he brought 935-55 me through the entry, 3996 which [was] at the side 3802 of the gate, 8179 into the holy 6944 chambers 3957 of the priests, 3548 which looked 6437-6 toward the north: 6828 and, behold, there [was] a place 4725 on the two sides 3411 westward. 3220

46:20 Then said 559-4 he unto me, This [is] the place 4725 where the priests 3548 shall boil 1310-17 the trespass offering 817 and the sin offering, 2403 where they shall bake 644-4 the meat offering; 4503 that they bear [them] not out 3318-53 into the utter 2435 court, 2691 to sanctify 6942-15 the people. 5971

46:21 Then he brought me forth 3318-55 into the utter 2435 court, 2691 and caused me to pass 5674-55 by the four 702 corners 4740 of the court; 2691 and, behold, in every corner 4740 4740 of the court 2691 2691 [there was] a court. 2691 2691

46:22 In the four 702 corners 4740 of the court 2691 [there were] courts 2691 joined 7000-7 of forty 705 [cubits] long 753 and thirty 7970 broad: 7341 these four 702 corners 7106-94 [were] of one 259 measure. 4060

46:23 And [there was] a row 2905 [of building] round about 5439 in them, round about 5439 them four, 702 and [it was] made 6213-7 with boiling places 4018 under the rows 2918 round about. 5439

46:24 Then said 559-4 he unto me, These [are] the places 1004 of them that boil, 1310-18 where the ministers 8334-18 of the house 1004 shall boil 1310-17 the sacrifice 2077 of the people. 5971

47:1 Afterward he brought me again 7725-55 unto the door 6607 of the house; 1004 and, behold, waters 4325 issued out 3318-6 from under the threshold 4670 of the house 1004 eastward: 6921 for the forefront 6440 of the house 1004 [stood toward] the east, 6921 and the waters 4325 came down 3381-6 from under from the right 3233 side 3802 of the house, 1004 at the south 5045 [side] of the altar. 4196

47:2 Then brought he me out 3318-55 of the way 1870 of the gate 8179 northward, 6828 and led me about 5437-55 the way 1870 without 2351 unto the utter 2351 gate 8179 by the way 1870 that looketh 6437-6 eastward; 6921 and, behold, there ran out 6379-18 waters 4325 on the right 3233 side. 3802

47:3 And when the man 376 that had the line 6957 in his hand 3027 went forth 3318-2 eastward, 6921 he measured 4058-4 a thousand 505 cubits, 520 and he brought 5674-55 me through the waters; 4325 the waters 4325 [were] to the ankles. 657

47:4 Again he measured 4058-4 a thousand, 505 and brought 5674-55 me through the waters; 4325 the waters 4325 [were] to the knees. 1290 Again he measured 4058-4 a thousand, 505 and brought me through; 5674-55 the waters 4325 [were] to the loins. 4975

47:5 Afterward he measured 4058-4 a thousand; 505 [and it was] a river 5158 that I could 3201-4 not pass over: 5674-2 for the waters 4325 were risen, 1342-1 waters 4325 to swim in, 7813 a river 5158 that could not be passed over. 5674-11

47:6 And he said 559-4 unto me, Son 1121 of man, 120 hast thou seen 7200-1 [this]? Then he brought 3212-55 me, and caused me to return 7725-55 to the brink 8193 of the river. 5158

47:7 Now when I had returned, 7725-2 behold, at the bank 8193 of the river 5158 [were] very 3966 many 7227 trees 6086 on the one side and on the other.

47:8 Then said 559-4 he unto me, These waters 4325 issue out 3318-6 toward the east 6930 country, 1552 and go down 3381-1 into the desert, 6160 and go 935-1 into the sea: 3220 [which being] brought forth 3318-94 into the sea, 3220 the waters 4325 shall be healed. 7495-8

47:9 And it shall come to pass, [that] every thing 5315 that liveth, 2416 which moveth, 8317-4 whithersoever the rivers 5158 shall come, 935-4 shall live: 2421-4 and there shall be a very 3966 great 7227 multitude of fish, 1710 because these waters 4325 shall come 935-1 thither: for they shall be healed; 7495-11 and every thing shall live 2425-1 whither the river 5158 cometh. 935-4

47:10 And it shall come to pass, [that] the fishers 1728 shall stand 5975-1|5975-4-k upon it from Engedi 5872 even unto Eneglaim; 5882 they shall be a [place] to spread forth 4894 nets; 2764 their fish 1710 shall be according to their kinds, 4327 as the fish 1710 of the great 1419 sea, 3220 exceeding 3966 many. 7227

47:11 But the miry places 1207 thereof and the marishes 1360 thereof shall not be healed; 7495-11 they shall be given 5414-8 to salt. 4417

47:12 And by the river 5158 upon the bank 8193 thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow 5927-4 all trees 6086 for meat, 3978 whose leaf 5929 shall not fade, 5034-4 neither shall the fruit 6529 thereof be consumed: 8552-4 it shall bring forth new fruit 1069-17 according to his months, 2320 because their waters 4325 they issued out 3318-6 of the sanctuary: 4720 and the fruit 6529 thereof shall be for meat, 3978 and the leaf 5929 thereof for medicine. 8644

47:13 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD; 3069 This 1454 [shall be] the border, 1366 whereby ye shall inherit 5157-101 the land 776 according to the twelve 8147 6240 tribes 7626 of Israel: 3478 Joseph 3130 [shall have two] portions. 2256

47:14 And ye shall inherit 5157-1 it, one 376 as well as another: 251 [concerning] the which I lifted up 5375-1 mine hand 3027 to give 5414-2 it unto your fathers: 1 and this land 776 shall fall 5307-1 unto you for inheritance. 5159

47:15 And this [shall be] the border 1366 of the land 776 toward the north 6828 side, 6285 from the great 1419 sea, 3220 the way 1870 of Hethlon, 2855 as men go 935-2 to Zedad; 6657

47:16 Hamath, 2574 Berothah, 1268 Sibraim, 5453 which [is] between the border 1366 of Damascus 1834 and the border 1366 of Hamath; 2574 Hazarhatticon, 2691|8484|2694 which [is] by the coast 1366 of Hauran. 2362

47:17 And the border 1366 from the sea 3220 shall be Hazarenan, 2703 the border 1366 of Damascus, 1834 and the north 6828 northward, 6828 and the border 1366 of Hamath. 2574 And [this is] the north 6828 side. 6285

47:18 And the east 6921 side 6285 ye shall measure 4058-4 from 996 Hauran, 2362 and from 996 Damascus, 1834 and from 996 Gilead, 1568 and from 996 the land 776 of Israel 3478 [by] Jordan, 3383 from the border 1366 unto the east 6931 sea. 3220 And [this is] the east 6921 side. 6285

47:19 And the south 5045 side 6285 southward, 8486 from Tamar 8559 [even] to the waters 4325 of strife 4808|4809 [in] Kadesh, 6946 the river 5159 to the great 1419 sea. 3220 And [this is] the south 8486 side 6285 southward. 5045

47:20 The west 3220 side 6285 also [shall be] the great 1419 sea 3220 from the border, 1366 till a man come 935-2 over against 5227 Hamath. 2574 This [is] the west 3220 side. 6285

47:21 So shall ye divide 2505-14 this land 776 unto you according to the tribes 7626 of Israel. 3478

47:22 And it shall come to pass, [that] ye shall divide it by lot 5307-55 for an inheritance 5159 unto you, and to the strangers 1616 that sojourn 1481-6 among 8432 you, which shall beget 3205-52 children 1121 among 8432 you: and they shall be unto you as born in the country 249 among the children 1121 of Israel; 3478 they shall have 5307-4 inheritance 5159 with you among 8432 the tribes 7626 of Israel. 3478

47:23 And it shall come to pass, [that] in what tribe 7626 the stranger 1616 sojourneth, 1481-1 there shall ye give 5414-4 [him] his inheritance, 5159 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069

48:1 Now these [are] the names 8034 of the tribes. 7626 From the north 6828 end 7097 to the coast 3027 of the way 1870 of Hethlon, 2855 as one goeth 935-2 to Hamath, 2574 Hazarenan, 2704 the border 1366 of Damascus 1834 northward, 6828 to the coast 3027 of Hamath; 2574 for these are his sides 6285 east 6921 [and] west; 3220 a 259 [portion for] Dan. 1835

48:2 And by the border 1366 of Dan, 1835 from the east 6921 side 6285 unto the west 3220 side, 6285 a 259 [portion for] Asher. 836

48:3 And by the border 1366 of Asher, 836 from the east 6921 side 6285 even unto the west 3220 side, 6285 a 259 [portion for] Naphtali. 5321

48:4 And by the border 1366 of Naphtali, 5321 from the east 6921 side 6285 unto the west 3220 side, 6285 a 259 [portion for] Manasseh. 4519

48:5 And by the border 1366 of Manasseh, 4519 from the east 6921 side 6285 unto the west 3220 side, 6285 a 259 [portion for] Ephraim. 669

48:8 And by the border 1366 of Judah, 3063 from the east 6921 side 6285 unto the west 3220 side, 6285 shall be the offering 8641 which ye shall offer 7311-55 of five 2568 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 [reeds in] breadth, 7341 and [in] length 753 as one 259 of the [other] parts, 2506 from the east 6921 side 6285 unto the west 3220 side: 6285 and the sanctuary 4720 shall be in the midst 8432 of it.

48:9 The oblation 8641 that ye shall offer 7311-55 unto the LORD 3068 [shall be] of five 2568 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 in length, 753 and of ten 6235 thousand 505 in breadth. 7341

48:10 And for them, [even] for the priests, 3548 shall be [this] holy 6944 oblation; 8641 toward the north 6828 five 2568 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 [in length], and toward the west 3220 ten 6235 thousand 505 in breadth, 7341 and toward the east 6921 ten 6235 thousand 505 in breadth, 7341 and toward the south 5045 five 2568 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 in length: 753 and the sanctuary 4720 of the LORD 3068 shall be in the midst 8432 thereof.

48:11 [It shall be] for the priests 3548 that are sanctified 6942-30 of the sons 1121 of Zadok; 6659 which have kept 8104-1 my charge, 4931 which went not astray 8582-1 when the children 1121 of Israel 3478 went astray, 8582-2 as the Levites 3881 went astray. 8582-1

48:12 And [this] oblation 8642 of the land 776 that is offered 8641 shall be unto them a thing most 6944 holy 6944 by the border 1366 of the Levites. 3881

48:13 And over against 5980 the border 1366 of the priests 3548 the Levites 3881 [shall have] five 2568 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 in length, 753 and ten 6235 thousand 505 in breadth: 7341 all the length 753 [shall be] five 2568 and twenty 6242 thousand, 505 and the breadth 7341 ten 6235 thousand. 505

48:15 And the five 2568 thousand, 505 that are left 3498-12 in the breadth 7341 over against 6440 the five 2568 and twenty 6242 thousand, 505 shall be a profane 2455 [place] for the city, 5892 for dwelling, 4186 and for suburbs: 4054 and the city 5892 shall be in the midst 8432 thereof.

48:18 And the residue 3498-12 in length 753 over against 5980 the oblation 8641 of the holy 6944 [portion shall be] ten 6235 thousand 505 eastward, 6921 and ten 6235 thousand 505 westward: 3220 and it shall be over against 5980 the oblation 8641 of the holy 6944 [portion]; and the increase 8393 thereof shall be for food 3899 unto them that serve 5647-6 the city. 5892

48:19 And they that serve 5647-6 the city 5892 shall serve 5647-4 it out of all the tribes 7626 of Israel. 3478

48:20 All the oblation 8641 [shall be] five 2568 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 by five 2568 and twenty 6242 thousand: 505 ye shall offer 7311-55 the holy 6944 oblation 8641 foursquare, 7243 with the possession 272 of the city. 5892

48:21 And the residue 3498-12 [shall be] for the prince, 5387 on the one side and on the other of the holy 6944 oblation, 8641 and of the possession 272 of the city, 5892 over against 6440 the five 2568 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 of the oblation 8641 toward the east 6921 border, 1366 and westward 3220 over against 6440 the five 2568 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 toward the west 3220 border, 1366 over against 5980 the portions 2506 for the prince: 5387 and it shall be the holy 6944 oblation; 8641 and the sanctuary 4720 of the house 1004 [shall be] in the midst 8432 thereof.

48:22 Moreover from the possession 272 of the Levites, 3881 and from the possession 272 of the city, 5892 [being] in the midst 8432 [of that] which is the prince's, 5387 between the border 1366 of Judah 3063 and the border 1366 of Benjamin, 1144 shall be for the prince. 5387

48:23 As for the rest 3499 of the tribes, 7626 from the east 6921 side 6285 unto the west 3220 side, 6285 Benjamin 1144 [shall have] a 259 [portion].

48:24 And by the border 1366 of Benjamin, 1144 from the east 6921 side 6285 unto the west 3220 side, 6285 Simeon 8095 [shall have] a 259 [portion].

48:29 This [is] the land 776 which ye shall divide by lot 5307-55 unto the tribes 7626 of Israel 3478 for inheritance, 5159 and these [are] their portions, 4256 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD. 3069
