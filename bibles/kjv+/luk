1:1 Forasmuch 1895 as many 4183 have taken in hand 2021 5656 to set forth in order 392 5664 a declaration 1335 of 4012 those things 4229 which are most surely believed 4135 5772 among 1722 us 2254, 

1:2 Even 2531 as they delivered 3860 5627 them unto us 2254, which 3588 from 575 the beginning 746 were 1096 5637 eyewitnesses 845, and 2532 ministers 5257 of the word 3056; 

1:3 It seemed 1380 5656 good to me also 2504, having had perfect 199 understanding 3877 5761 of all things 3956 from the very first 509, to write 1125 5658 unto thee 4671 in order 2517, most excellent 2903 Theophilus 2321, 

1:4 That 2443 thou mightest know 1921 5632 the certainty 803 of 4012 those things 3056, wherein 3739 thou hast been instructed 2727 5681. 

1:5 There was 1096 5633 in 1722 the days 2250 of Herod 2264, the king 935 of Judaea 2449, a certain 5100 priest 2409 named 3686 Zacharias 2197, of 1537 the course 2183 of Abia 7: and 2532 his 846 wife 1135 [was] of 1537 the daughters 2364 of Aaron 2, and 2532 her 846 name 3686 [was] Elisabeth 1665. 

1:6 And 1161 they were 2258 5713 both 297 righteous 1342 before 1799 God 2316, walking 4198 5740 in 1722 all 3956 the commandments 1785 and 2532 ordinances 1345 of the Lord 2962 blameless 273. 

1:7 And 2532 they 846 had 2258 5713 no 3756 child 5043, because 2530 that Elisabeth 1665 was 2258 5713 barren 4723, and 2532 they 846 both 297 were 2258 5713 [now] well stricken 4260 5761 in 1722 years 2250 848. 

1:8 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, that while 1722 he 846 executed the priest's office 2407 5721 before 1725 God 2316 in 1722 the order 5010 of his 846 course 2183, 

1:9 According 2596 to the custom 1485 of the priest's office 2405, his lot 2975 5627 was to burn incense 2370 5658 when he went 1525 5631 into 1519 the temple 3485 of the Lord 2962. 

1:10 And 2532 the whole 3956 multitude 4128 of the people 2992 were 2258 5713 praying 4336 5740 without 1854 at the time 5610 of incense 2368. 

1:11 And 1161 there appeared 3700 5681 unto him 846 an angel 32 of the Lord 2962 standing 2476 5761 on 1537 the right side 1188 of the altar 2379 of incense 2368. 

1:12 And 2532 when Zacharias 2197 saw 1492 5631 [him], he was troubled 5015 5681, and 2532 fear 5401 fell 1968 5627 upon 1909 him 846. 

1:13 But 1161 the angel 32 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Fear 5399 5732 5737 not 3361, Zacharias 2197: for 1360 thy 4675 prayer 1162 is heard 1522 5681; and 2532 thy 4675 wife 1135 Elisabeth 1665 shall bear 1080 5692 thee 4671 a son 5207, and 2532 thou shalt call 2564 5692 his 846 name 3686 John 2491. 

1:14 And 2532 thou 4671 shalt have 2071 5704 joy 5479 and 2532 gladness 20; and 2532 many 4183 shall rejoice 5463 5690 at 1909 his 846 birth 1083. 

1:15 For 1063 he shall be 2071 5704 great 3173 in the sight 1799 of the Lord 2962, and 2532 shall drink 4095 5632 neither 3364 wine 3631 nor 2532 strong drink 4608; and 2532 he shall be filled 4130 5701 with the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, even 2089 from 1537 his 848 mother's 3384 womb 2836. 

1:16 And 2532 many 4183 of the children 5207 of Israel 2474 shall he turn 1994 5692 to 1909 the Lord 2962 their 846 God 2316. 

1:17 And 2532 he 846 shall go 4281 5695 before 1799 him 846 in 1722 the spirit 4151 and 2532 power 1411 of Elias 2243, to turn 1994 5658 the hearts 2588 of the fathers 3962 to 1909 the children 5043, and 2532 the disobedient 545 to 1722 the wisdom 5428 of the just 1342; to make ready 2090 5658 a people 2992 prepared 2680 5772 for the Lord 2962. 

1:18 And 2532 Zacharias 2197 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 the angel 32, Whereby 2596 5101 shall I know 1097 5695 this 5124? for 1063 I 1473 am 1510 5748 an old man 4246, and 2532 my 3450 wife 1135 well stricken 4260 5761 in 1722 years 2250 848. 

1:19 And 2532 the angel 32 answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, I 1473 am 1510 5748 Gabriel 1043, that stand 3936 5761 in the presence 1799 of God 2316; and 2532 am sent 649 5648 to speak 2980 5658 unto 4314 thee 4571, and 2532 to shew 2097 0 thee 4671 these 5023 glad tidings 2097 5670. 

1:20 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, thou 2071 5704 shalt be dumb 4623 5723, and 2532 not 3361 able 1410 5740 to speak 2980 5658, until 891 the day 2250 that 3739 these things 5023 shall be performed 1096 5638, because 473 3739 thou believest 4100 5656 not 3756 my 3450 words 3056, which 3748 shall be fulfilled 4137 5701 in 1519 their 846 season 2540. 

1:21 And 2532 the people 2992 waited 2258 5713 4328 5723 for Zacharias 2197, and 2532 marvelled 2296 5707 that 1722 he 846 tarried so long 5549 5721 in 1722 the temple 3485. 

1:22 And 1161 when he came out 1831 5631, he could 1410 5711 not 3756 speak 2980 5658 unto them 846: and 2532 they perceived 1921 5627 that 3754 he had seen 3708 5758 a vision 3701 in 1722 the temple 3485: for 2532 he beckoned 1269 5723 2258 5713 unto them 846, and 2532 remained 1265 5707 speechless 2974. 

1:23 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, that, as soon as 5613 the days 2250 of his ministration 3009 were accomplished 4130 5681, he departed 565 5627 to 1519 his own 848 house 3624. 

1:24 And 1161 after 3326 those 5025 days 2250 his 846 wife 1135 Elisabeth 1665 conceived 4815 5627, and 2532 hid 4032 5707 herself 1438 five 4002 months 3376, saying 3004 5723, 

1:25 3754 Thus 3779 hath 4160 0 the Lord 2962 dealt 4160 5758 with me 3427 in 1722 the days 2250 wherein 3739 he looked on 1896 5627 [me], to take away 851 5629 my 3450 reproach 3681 among 1722 men 444. 

1:26 And 1161 in 1722 the sixth 1623 month 3376 the angel 32 Gabriel 1043 was sent 649 5648 from 5259 God 2316 unto 1519 a city 4172 of Galilee 1056, named 3739 3686 Nazareth 3478, 

1:27 To 4314 a virgin 3933 espoused 3423 5772 to a man 435 whose 3739 name 3686 was Joseph 2501, of 1537 the house 3624 of David 1138; and 2532 the virgin's 3933 name 3686 [was] Mary 3137. 

1:28 And 2532 the angel 32 came in 1525 5631 unto 4314 her 846, and said 2036 5627, Hail 5463 5720, [thou that art] highly favoured 5487 5772, the Lord 2962 [is] with 3326 thee 4675: blessed 2127 5772 [art] thou 4771 among 1722 women 1135. 

1:29 And 1161 when she saw 1492 5631 [him], she was troubled 1298 5681 at 1909 his 846 saying 3056, and 2532 cast in her mind 1260 5711 what manner 4217 of salutation 783 this 3778 should be 1498 5751. 

1:30 And 2532 the angel 32 said 2036 5627 unto her 846, Fear 5399 5732 5737 not 3361, Mary 3137: for 1063 thou hast found 2147 5627 favour 5485 with 3844 God 2316. 

1:31 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, thou shalt conceive 4815 5695 in 1722 thy womb 1064, and 2532 bring forth 5088 5695 a son 5207, and 2532 shalt call 2564 5692 his 846 name 3686 JESUS 2424. 

1:32 He 3778 shall be 2071 5704 great 3173, and 2532 shall be called 2564 5701 the Son 5207 of the Highest 5310: and 2532 the Lord 2962 God 2316 shall give 1325 5692 unto him 846 the throne 2362 of his 846 father 3962 David 1138: 

1:33 And 2532 he shall reign 936 5692 over 1909 the house 3624 of Jacob 2384 for 1519 ever 165; and 2532 of his 846 kingdom 932 there shall be 2071 5704 no 3756 end 5056. 

1:34 Then 1161 said 2036 5627 Mary 3137 unto 4314 the angel 32, How 4459 shall 2071 0 this 5124 be 2071 5704, seeing 1893 I know 1097 5719 not 3756 a man 435? 

1:35 And 2532 the angel 32 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto her 846, The Holy 40 Ghost 4151 shall come 1904 5695 upon 1909 thee 4571, and 2532 the power 1411 of the Highest 5310 shall overshadow 1982 5692 thee 4671: therefore 1352 also 2532 that holy thing 40 which shall be born 1080 5746 of 1537 thee 4675 shall be called 2564 5701 the Son 5207 of God 2316. 

1:36 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, thy 4675 cousin 4773 Elisabeth 1665, she hath 4815 0 also 2532 conceived 4815 5761 a son 5207 in 1722 her 848 old age 1094: and 2532 this 3778 is 2076 5748 the sixth 1623 month 3376 with her 846, who 3588 was called 2564 5746 barren 4723. 

1:37 For 3754 with 3844 God 2316 nothing 3756 3956 4487 shall be impossible 101 5692. 

1:38 And 1161 Mary 3137 said 2036 5627, Behold 2400 5628 the handmaid 1399 of the Lord 2962; be it 1096 5636 unto me 3427 according 2596 to thy 4675 word 4487. And 2532 the angel 32 departed 565 5627 from 575 her 846. 

1:39 And 1161 Mary 3137 arose 450 5631 in 1722 those 5025 days 2250, and went 4198 5675 into 1519 the hill country 3714 with 3326 haste 4710, into 1519 a city 4172 of Juda 2448 5625 2455; 

1:40 And 2532 entered 1525 5627 into 1519 the house 3624 of Zacharias 2197, and 2532 saluted 782 5662 Elisabeth 1665. 

1:41 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, that, when 5613 Elisabeth 1665 heard 191 5656 the salutation 783 of Mary 3137, the babe 1025 leaped 4640 5656 in 1722 her 846 womb 2836; and 2532 Elisabeth 1665 was filled 4130 5681 with the Holy 40 Ghost 4151: 

1:42 And 2532 she spake out 400 5656 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, and 2532 said 2036 5627, Blessed 2127 5772 [art] thou 4771 among 1722 women 1135, and 2532 blessed 2127 5772 [is] the fruit 2590 of thy 4675 womb 2836. 

1:43 And 2532 whence 4159 [is] this 5124 to me 3427, that 2443 the mother 3384 of my 3450 Lord 2962 should come 2064 5632 to 4314 me 3165? 

1:44 For 1063, lo 2400 5628, as soon as 5613 the voice 5456 of thy 4675 salutation 783 sounded 1096 5633 in 1519 mine 3450 ears 3775, the babe 1025 leaped 4640 5656 in 1722 my 3450 womb 2836 for 1722 joy 20. 

1:45 And 2532 blessed 3107 [is] she that believed 4100 5660: for 3754 there shall be 2071 5704 a performance 5050 of those things which were told 2980 5772 her 846 from 3844 the Lord 2962. 

1:46 And 2532 Mary 3137 said 2036 5627, My 3450 soul 5590 doth magnify 3170 5719 the Lord 2962, 

1:47 And 2532 my 3450 spirit 4151 hath rejoiced 21 5656 in 1909 God 2316 my 3450 Saviour 4990. 

1:48 For 3754 he hath regarded 1914 5656 1909 the low estate 5014 of his 848 handmaiden 1399: for 1063, behold 2400 5628, from 575 henceforth 3568 all 3956 generations 1074 shall call 3106 0 me 3165 blessed 3106 5692. 

1:49 For 3754 he that is mighty 1415 hath done 4160 5656 to me 3427 great things 3167; and 2532 holy 40 [is] his 846 name 3686. 

1:50 And 2532 his 846 mercy 1656 [is] on them that fear 5399 5740 him 846 from 1519 generation 1074 to generation 1074. 

1:51 He hath shewed 4160 5656 strength 2904 with 1722 his 848 arm 1023; he hath scattered 1287 5656 the proud 5244 in the imagination 1271 of their 846 hearts 2588. 

1:52 He hath put down 2507 5627 the mighty 1413 from 575 [their] seats 2362, and 2532 exalted 5312 5656 them of low degree 5011. 

1:53 He hath filled 1705 5656 the hungry 3983 5723 with good things 18; and 2532 the rich 4147 5723 he hath sent 1821 0 empty 2756 away 1821 5656. 

1:54 He hath holpen 482 5633 his 848 servant 3816 Israel 2474, in remembrance 3415 5683 of [his] mercy 1656; 

1:55 As 2531 he spake 2980 5656 to 4314 our 2257 fathers 3962, to Abraham 11, and 2532 to his 846 seed 4690 for 1519 ever 165. 

1:56 And 1161 Mary 3137 abode 3306 5656 with 4862 her 846 about 5616 three 5140 months 3376, and 2532 returned 5290 5656 to 1519 her own 848 house 3624. 

1:57 Now 1161 Elisabeth's 1665 full 4130 0 time 5550 came 4130 5681 that she 846 should be delivered 5088 5629; and 2532 she brought forth 1080 5656 a son 5207. 

1:58 And 2532 her neighbours 4040 and 2532 her 846 cousins 4773 heard 191 5656 how 3754 the Lord 2962 had shewed great 3170 5707 mercy 848 1656 upon 3326 her 846; and 2532 they rejoiced 4796 5707 with her 846. 

1:59 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, that on 1722 the eighth 3590 day 2250 they came 2064 5627 to circumcise 4059 5629 the child 3813; and 2532 they called 2564 5707 him 846 Zacharias 2197, after 1909 the name 3686 of his 846 father 3962. 

1:60 And 2532 his 846 mother 3384 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, Not 3780 [so]; but 235 he shall be called 2564 5701 John 2491. 

1:61 And 2532 they said 2036 5627 unto 4314 her 846, 3754 There is 2076 5748 none 3762 of 1722 thy 4675 kindred 4772 that 3739 is called 2564 5743 by this 5129 name 3686. 

1:62 And 1161 they made signs 1770 5707 to his 846 father 3962, how 5101 302 he would have 2309 5722 him 846 called 2564 5745. 

1:63 And 2532 he asked for 154 5660 a writing table 4093, and wrote 1125 5656, saying 3004 5723, His 846 name 3686 is 2076 5748 John 2491. And 2532 they marvelled 2296 5656 all 3956. 

1:64 And 1161 his 846 mouth 4750 was opened 455 5681 immediately 3916, and 2532 his 846 tongue 1100 [loosed], and 2532 he spake 2980 5707, and praised 2127 5723 God 2316. 

1:65 And 2532 fear 5401 came 1096 5633 on 1909 all 3956 that dwelt round about 4039 5723 them 846: and 2532 all 3956 these 5023 sayings 4487 were noised abroad 1255 5712 throughout 1722 all 3650 the hill country 3714 of Judaea 2449. 

1:66 And 2532 all 3956 they that heard 191 5660 [them] laid [them] up 5087 5639 in 1722 their 848 hearts 2588, saying 3004 5723, What 5101 manner 686 of child 3813 shall 2071 0 this 5124 be 2071 5704! And 2532 the hand 5495 of the Lord 2962 was 2258 5713 with 3326 him 846. 

1:67 And 2532 his 846 father 3962 Zacharias 2197 was filled 4130 5681 with the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, and 2532 prophesied 4395 5656, saying 3004 5723, 

1:68 Blessed 2128 [be] the Lord 2962 God 2316 of Israel 2474; for 3754 he hath visited 1980 5662 and 2532 redeemed 3085 his 848 people 2992 4160 5656, 

1:69 And 2532 hath raised up 1453 5656 an horn 2768 of salvation 4991 for us 2254 in 1722 the house 3624 of his 848 servant 3816 David 1138; 

1:70 As 2531 he spake 2980 5656 by 1223 the mouth 4750 of his 848 holy 40 prophets 4396, which 3588 have been since 575 the world began 165: 

1:71 That we should be saved 4991 from 1537 our 2257 enemies 2190, and 2532 from 1537 the hand 5495 of all 3956 that hate 3404 5723 us 2248; 

1:72 To perform 4160 5658 the mercy 1656 [promised] to 3326 our 2257 fathers 3962, and 2532 to remember 3415 5683 his 848 holy 40 covenant 1242; 

1:73 The oath 3727 which 3739 he sware 3660 5656 to 4314 our 2257 father 3962 Abraham 11, 

1:74 That he would grant 1325 5629 unto us 2254, that we being delivered 4506 5685 out of 1537 the hand 5495 of our 2257 enemies 2190 might serve 3000 5721 him 846 without fear 870, 

1:75 In 1722 holiness 3742 and 2532 righteousness 1343 before 1799 him 846, all 3956 the days 2250 of our 2257 life 2222. 

1:76 And 2532 thou 4771, child 3813, shalt be called 2564 5701 the prophet 4396 of the Highest 5310: for 1063 thou shalt go 4313 5695 before 4253 the face 4383 of the Lord 2962 to prepare 2090 5658 his 846 ways 3598; 

1:77 To give 1325 5629 knowledge 1108 of salvation 4991 unto his 846 people 2992 by 1722 the remission 859 of their 846 sins 266, 

1:78 Through 1223 the tender 4698 mercy 1656 of our 2257 God 2316; whereby 1722 3739 the dayspring 395 from 1537 on high 5311 hath visited 1980 5662 us 2248, 

1:79 To give light 2014 5658 to them that sit 2521 5740 in 1722 darkness 4655 and 2532 [in] the shadow 4639 of death 2288, to guide 2720 5658 our 2257 feet 4228 into 1519 the way 3598 of peace 1515. 

1:80 And 1161 the child 3813 grew 837 5707, and 2532 waxed strong 2901 5712 in spirit 4151, and 2532 was 2258 5713 in 1722 the deserts 2048 till 2193 the day 2250 of his 846 shewing 323 unto 4314 Israel 2474. 

2:1 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633 in 1722 those 1565 days 2250, that there went out 1831 5627 a decree 1378 from 3844 Caesar 2541 Augustus 828, that all 3956 the world 3625 should be taxed 583 5729. 

2:2 ([And] this 3778 taxing 582 was 1096 0 first 4413 made 1096 5633 when Cyrenius 2958 was governor 2230 5723 of Syria 4947) 

2:3 And 2532 all 3956 went 4198 5711 to be taxed 583 5745, every one 1538 into 1519 his own 2398 city 4172. 

2:4 And 1161 Joseph 2501 also 2532 went up 305 5627 from 575 Galilee 1056, out of 1537 the city 4172 of Nazareth 3478, into 1519 Judaea 2449, unto the city 4172 of David 1138, which 3748 is called 2564 5743 Bethlehem 965; (because 1223 he was 1511 5750 of 1537 the house 3624 and 2532 lineage 3965 of David 1138) 

2:5 To be taxed 583 5670 with 4862 Mary 3137 his 846 espoused 3423 5772 wife 1135, being 5607 5752 great with child 1471. 

2:6 And 1161 so it was 1096 5633, that, while 1722 they 846 were 1511 5750 there 1563, the days 2250 were accomplished 4130 5681 that she 846 should be delivered 5088 5629. 

2:7 And 2532 she brought forth 5088 5627 her 848 firstborn 4416 son 5207, and 2532 wrapped 4683 0 him 846 in swaddling clothes 4683 5656, and 2532 laid 347 5656 him 846 in 1722 a manger 5336; because 1360 there was 2258 5713 no 3756 room 5117 for them 846 in 1722 the inn 2646. 

2:8 And 2532 there were 2258 5713 in 1722 the same 846 country 5561 shepherds 4166 abiding in the field 63 5723, 2532 keeping 5442 5723 watch 5438 over 1909 their 848 flock 4167 by night 3571. 

2:9 And 2532, lo 2400 5628, the angel 32 of the Lord 2962 came upon 2186 5627 them 846, and 2532 the glory 1391 of the Lord 2962 shone round about 4034 5656 them 846: and 2532 they were sore 3173 afraid 5399 5675 5401. 

2:10 And 2532 the angel 32 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Fear 5399 5737 not 3361: for 1063, behold 2400 5628, I bring 2097 0 you 5213 good tidings 2097 5731 of great 3173 joy 5479, which 3748 shall be 2071 5704 to all 3956 people 2992. 

2:11 For 3754 unto you 5213 is born 5088 5681 this day 4594 in 1722 the city 4172 of David 1138 a Saviour 4990, which 3739 is 2076 5748 Christ 5547 the Lord 2962. 

2:12 And 2532 this 5124 [shall be] a sign 4592 unto you 5213; Ye shall find 2147 5692 the babe 1025 wrapped in swaddling clothes 4683 5772, lying 2749 5740 in 1722 a manger 5336. 

2:13 And 2532 suddenly 1810 there was 1096 5633 with 4862 the angel 32 a multitude 4128 of the heavenly 3770 host 4756 praising 134 5723 God 2316, and 2532 saying 3004 5723, 

2:14 Glory 1391 to God 2316 in 1722 the highest 5310, and 2532 on 1909 earth 1093 peace 1515, good will 2107 toward 1722 men 444. 

2:15 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, as 5613 the angels 32 were gone away 565 5627 from 575 them 846 into 1519 heaven 3772, 2532 the shepherds 444 4166 said 2036 5627 one 240 0 to 4314 another 240, Let us 1330 0 now 1211 go 1330 5632 even unto 2193 Bethlehem 965, and 2532 see 1492 5632 this 5124 thing 4487 which is come to pass 1096 5756, which 3588 the Lord 2962 hath made known 1107 5656 unto us 2254. 

2:16 And 2532 they came 2064 5627 with haste 4692 5660, and 2532 5037 found 429 5627 Mary 3137, and 2532 Joseph 2501, and 2532 the babe 1025 lying 2749 5740 in 1722 a manger 5336. 

2:17 And 1161 when they had seen 1492 5631 [it], they made known abroad 1232 5656 the saying 4012 4487 which 3588 was told 2980 5685 them 846 concerning 4012 this 5127 child 3813. 

2:18 And 2532 all 3956 they that heard 191 5660 [it] wondered 2296 5656 at 4012 those things which 3588 were told 2980 5685 them 4314 846 by 5259 the shepherds 4166. 

2:19 But 1161 Mary 3137 kept 4933 5707 all 3956 these things 4487 5023, and pondered 4820 5723 [them] in 1722 her 848 heart 2588. 

2:20 And 2532 the shepherds 4166 returned 1994 5656, glorifying 1392 5723 and 2532 praising 134 5723 God 2316 for 1909 all the things 3956 that 3739 they had heard 191 5656 and 2532 seen 1492 5627, as 2531 it was told 2980 5681 unto 4314 them 846. 

2:21 And 2532 when 3753 eight 3638 days 2250 were accomplished 4130 5681 for the circumcising 4059 5629 of the child 3813, 2532 his 846 name 3686 was called 2564 5681 JESUS 2424, which 3588 was so named 2564 5685 of 5259 the angel 32 before 4253 he 846 was conceived 4815 5683 in 1722 the womb 2836. 

2:22 And 2532 when 3753 the days 2250 of her 846 purification 2512 according 2596 to the law 3551 of Moses 3475 were accomplished 4130 5681, they brought 321 5627 him 846 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414, to present 3936 5658 [him] to the Lord 2962; 

2:23 (As 2531 it is written 1125 5769 in 1722 the law 3551 of the Lord 2962, 3754 Every 3956 male 730 that openeth 1272 5723 the womb 3388 shall be called 2564 5701 holy 40 to the Lord 2962) 

2:24 And 2532 to offer 1325 5629 a sacrifice 2378 according 2596 to that which is said 2046 5772 in 1722 the law 3551 of the Lord 2962, A pair 2201 of turtledoves 5167, or 2228 two 1417 young 3502 pigeons 4058. 

2:25 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, there was 2258 5713 a man 444 in 1722 Jerusalem 2419, whose 3739 name 3686 [was] Simeon 4826; and 2532 the same 3778 man 444 [was] just 1342 and 2532 devout 2126, waiting 4327 5740 for the consolation 3874 of Israel 2474: and 2532 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 was 2258 5713 upon 1909 him 846. 

2:26 And 2532 it was 2258 5713 revealed 5537 5772 unto him 846 by 5259 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, that he should 1492 0 not 3361 see 1492 5629 death 2288, before 4250 2228 he had seen 1492 5632 the Lord's 2962 Christ 5547. 

2:27 And 2532 he came 2064 5627 by 1722 the Spirit 4151 into 1519 the temple 2411: and 2532 when the parents 1118 brought 1521 5629 in 1722 the child 3813 Jesus 2424, to do 4160 5658 for 4012 him 846 after 2596 the custom 1480 5772 of the law 3551, 

2:28 Then 2532 took he 1209 0 him 846 up 1209 5662 in 1519 his 848 arms 43, and 2532 blessed 2127 5656 God 2316, and 2532 said 2036 5627, 

2:29 Lord 1203, now 3568 lettest thou 630 0 thy 4675 servant 1401 depart 630 5719 in 1722 peace 1515, according 2596 to thy 4675 word 4487: 

2:30 For 3754 mine 3450 eyes 3788 have seen 1492 5627 thy 4675 salvation 4992, 

2:31 Which 3739 thou hast prepared 2090 5656 before 2596 the face 4383 of all 3956 people 2992; 

2:32 A light 5457 to 1519 lighten 602 the Gentiles 1484, and 2532 the glory 1391 of thy 4675 people 2992 Israel 2474. 

2:33 And 2532 Joseph 2501 and 2532 his 846 mother 3384 marvelled 2258 5713 2296 5723 at 1909 those things which were spoken 2980 5746 of 4012 him 846. 

2:34 And 2532 Simeon 4826 blessed 2127 5656 them 846, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 Mary 3137 his 846 mother 3384, Behold 2400 5628, this 3778 [child] is set 2749 5736 for 1519 the fall 4431 and 2532 rising again 386 of many 4183 in 1722 Israel 2474; and 2532 for 1519 a sign 4592 which shall be spoken against 483 5746; 

2:35 (Yea 1161, a sword 4501 shall pierce through 1330 5695 thy own 4675 soul 5590 also 2532) that 3704 the thoughts 1261 of 1537 many 4183 hearts 2588 302 may be revealed 601 5686. 

2:36 And 2532 there was 2258 5713 one Anna 451, a prophetess 4398, the daughter 2364 of Phanuel 5323, of 1537 the tribe 5443 of Aser 768: she 3778 was of a great 4183 1722 age 2250 4260 5761, and had lived 2198 5660 with 3326 an husband 435 seven 2033 years 2094 from 575 her 848 virginity 3932; 

2:37 And 2532 she 3778 [was] a widow 5503 of about 5613 fourscore 3589 and four 5064 years 2094, which 3739 departed 868 5711 not 3756 from 575 the temple 2411, but served 3000 5723 [God] with fastings 3521 and 2532 prayers 1162 night 3571 and 2532 day 2250. 

2:38 And 2532 she 3778 coming in 2186 5631 that 846 instant 5610 gave thanks likewise 437 5711 unto the Lord 2962, and 2532 spake 2980 5707 of 4012 him 846 to all 3956 them that looked 4327 5740 for redemption 3085 in 1722 Jerusalem 2419. 

2:39 And 2532 when 5613 they had performed 5055 5656 all things 537 according 2596 to the law 3551 of the Lord 2962, they returned 5290 5656 into 1519 Galilee 1056, to 1519 their own 848 city 4172 Nazareth 3478. 

2:40 And 1161 the child 3813 grew 837 5707, and 2532 waxed strong 2901 5712 in spirit 4151, filled 4137 5746 with wisdom 4678: and 2532 the grace 5485 of God 2316 was 2258 5713 upon 1909 him 846. 

2:41 Now 2532 his parents 1118 went 4198 5711 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419 every 2596 year 2094 at the feast 1859 of the passover 3957. 

2:42 And 2532 when 3753 he was 1096 5633 twelve 1427 years old 2094, they 846 went up 305 5631 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414 after 2596 the custom 1485 of the feast 1859. 

2:43 And 2532 when they had fulfilled 5048 5660 the days 2250, as 1722 they 846 returned 5290 5721, the child 3816 Jesus 2424 tarried behind 5278 5656 in 1722 Jerusalem 2419; and 2532 Joseph 2501 and 2532 his 846 mother 3384 knew 1097 5627 not 3756 [of it]. 

2:44 But 1161 they, supposing 3543 5660 him 846 to have been 1511 5750 in 1722 the company 4923, went 2064 5627 a day's 2250 journey 3598; and 2532 they sought 327 5707 him 846 among 1722 [their] kinsfolk 4773 and 2532 1722 acquaintance 1110. 

2:45 And 2532 when they found 2147 5631 him 846 not 3361, they turned back again 5290 5656 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419, seeking 2212 5723 him 846. 

2:46 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, that after 3326 three 5140 days 2250 they found 2147 5627 him 846 in 1722 the temple 2411, sitting 2516 5740 in 1722 the midst 3319 of the doctors 1320, both 2532 hearing 191 5723 them 846, and 2532 asking 1905 0 them 846 questions 1905 5723. 

2:47 And 1161 all 3956 that heard 191 5723 him 846 were astonished 1839 5710 at 1909 his 846 understanding 4907 and 2532 answers 612. 

2:48 And 2532 when they saw 1492 5631 him 846, they were amazed 1605 5648: and 2532 his 846 mother 3384 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Son 5043, why 5101 hast thou 4160 0 thus 3779 dealt 4160 5656 with us 2254? behold 2400 5628, thy 4675 father 3962 and I 2504 have sought 2212 5707 thee 4571 sorrowing 3600 5746. 

2:49 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, How 5101 is it that 3754 ye sought 2212 5707 me 3165? wist ye 1492 5715 not 3756 that 3754 I 3165 must 1163 5748 be 1511 5750 about 1722 my 3450 Father's business 3962? 

2:50 And 2532 they understood 4920 5656 not 3756 the saying 4487 which 3739 he spake 2980 5656 unto them 846. 

2:51 And 2532 he went down 2597 5627 with 3326 them 846, and 2532 came 2064 5627 to 1519 Nazareth 3478, and 2532 was 2258 5713 subject 5293 5746 unto them 846: but 2532 his 846 mother 3384 kept 1301 5707 all 3956 these 5023 sayings 4487 in 1722 her 848 heart 2588. 

2:52 And 2532 Jesus 2424 increased 4298 5707 in wisdom 4678 and 2532 stature 2244, and 2532 in favour 5485 with 3844 God 2316 and 2532 man 444. 

3:1 Now 1161 in 1722 the fifteenth 4003 year 2094 of the reign 2231 of Tiberius 5086 Caesar 2541, Pontius 4194 Pilate 4091 being governor 2230 5723 of Judaea 2449, and 2532 Herod 2264 being tetrarch 5075 5723 of Galilee 1056, and 1161 his 846 brother 80 Philip 5376 tetrarch 5075 5723 of Ituraea 2484 and 2532 of the region 5561 of Trachonitis 5139, and 2532 Lysanias 3078 the tetrarch 5075 5723 of Abilene 9, 

3:2 Annas 452 and 2532 Caiaphas 2533 being 1909 the high priests 749, the word 4487 of God 2316 came 1096 5633 unto 1909 John 2491 the son 5207 of Zacharias 2197 in 1722 the wilderness 2048. 

3:3 And 2532 he came 2064 5627 into 1519 all 3956 the country about 4066 Jordan 2446, preaching 2784 5723 the baptism 908 of repentance 3341 for 1519 the remission 859 of sins 266; 

3:4 As 5613 it is written 1125 5769 in 1722 the book 976 of the words 3056 of Esaias 2268 the prophet 4396, saying 3004 5723, The voice 5456 of one crying 994 5723 in 1722 the wilderness 2048, Prepare ye 2090 5657 the way 3598 of the Lord 2962, make 4160 5720 his 846 paths 5147 straight 2117. 

3:5 Every 3956 valley 5327 shall be 2071 5704 filled 4137 5701, and 2532 every 3956 mountain 3735 and 2532 hill 1015 shall be brought low 5013 5701; and 2532 the crooked 4646 shall be made 1519 straight 2117, and 2532 the rough 5138 ways 3598 [shall be] made 1519 smooth 3006; 

3:6 And 2532 all 3956 flesh 4561 shall see 3700 5695 the salvation 4992 of God 2316. 

3:7 Then 3767 said 3004 5707 he to the multitude 3793 that came forth 1607 5740 5734 to be baptized 907 5683 of 5259 him 846, O generation 1081 of vipers 2191, who 5101 hath warned 5263 5656 you 5213 to flee 5343 5629 from 575 the wrath 3709 to come 3195 5723? 

3:8 Bring forth 4160 5657 therefore 3767 fruits 2590 worthy 514 of repentance 3341, and 2532 begin 756 5672 not 3361 to say 3004 5721 within 1722 yourselves 1438, We have 2192 5719 Abraham 11 to [our] father 3962: for 1063 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 God 2316 is able 1410 5736 of 1537 these 5130 stones 3037 to raise up 1453 5658 children 5043 unto Abraham 11. 

3:9 And 1161 now 2235 also 2532 the axe 513 is laid 2749 5736 unto 4314 the root 4491 of the trees 1186: every 3956 tree 1186 therefore 3767 which bringeth 4160 0 not 3361 forth 4160 5723 good 2570 fruit 2590 is hewn down 1581 5743, and 2532 cast 906 5743 into 1519 the fire 4442. 

3:10 And 2532 the people 3793 asked 1905 5707 him 846, saying 3004 5723, What 5101 shall we do 4160 5692 then 3767? 

3:11 He answereth 611 5679 and 1161 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, He that hath 2192 5723 two 1417 coats 5509, let him impart 3330 5628 to him that hath 2192 5723 none 3361; and 2532 he that hath 2192 5723 meat 1033, let him do 4160 5720 likewise 3668. 

3:12 Then 1161 came 2064 5627 also 2532 publicans 5057 to be baptized 907 5683, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Master 1320, what 5101 shall we do 4160 5692? 

3:13 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Exact 4238 5719 no 3367 more 4119 than 3844 that which is appointed 1299 5772 you 5213. 

3:14 And 1161 the soldiers 4754 5734 likewise 2532 demanded 1905 5707 of him 846, saying 3004 5723, And 2532 what 5101 shall we 2249 do 4160 5692? And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Do violence 1286 5661 to no man 3367, neither 3366 accuse [any] falsely 4811 5661; and 2532 be content 714 5744 with your 5216 wages 3800. 

3:15 And 1161 as the people 2992 were in expectation 4328 5723, and 2532 all men 3956 mused 1260 5740 in 1722 their 848 hearts 2588 of 4012 John 2491, whether 3379 0 he 846 were 1498 5751 the Christ 5547, or not 3379; 

3:16 John 2491 answered 611 5662, saying 3004 5723 unto [them] all 537, I 1473 indeed 3303 baptize 907 5719 you 5209 with water 5204; but 1161 one mightier than 2478 I 3450 cometh 2064 5736, the latchet 2438 of whose 3739 shoes 5266 I am 1510 5748 not 3756 worthy 2425 to unloose 3089 5658: he 846 shall baptize 907 5692 you 5209 with 1722 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 and 2532 with fire 4442: 

3:17 Whose 3739 fan 4425 [is] in 1722 his 846 hand 5495, and 2532 he will throughly purge 1245 5692 his 848 floor 257, and 2532 will gather 4863 5692 the wheat 4621 into 1519 his 848 garner 596; but 1161 the chaff 892 he will burn 2618 5692 with fire 4442 unquenchable 762. 

3:18 And 2532 3767 many 4183 0 other 2087 things 4183 3303 in his exhortation 3870 5723 preached 2097 5710 he unto the people 2992. 

3:19 But 1161 Herod 2264 the tetrarch 5076, being reproved 1651 5746 by 5259 him 846 for 4012 Herodias 2266 his 846 brother 80 Philip's 5376 wife 1135, and 2532 for 4012 all 3956 the evils 4190 which 3739 Herod 2264 had done 4160 5656, 

3:20 Added 4369 5656 yet 2532 this 5124 above 1909 all 3956, that 2532 he shut up 2623 5656 John 2491 in 1722 prison 5438. 

3:21 Now 1161 when all 537 the people 2992 were baptized 1722 907 5683, it came to pass 1096 5633, that Jesus 2424 also 2532 being baptized 907 5685, and 2532 praying 4336 5740, the heaven 3772 was opened 455 5683, 

3:22 And 2532 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 descended 2597 5629 in a bodily 4984 shape 1491 like 5616 a dove 4058 upon 1909 him 846, and 2532 a voice 5456 came 1096 5635 from 1537 heaven 3772, which said 3004 5723, Thou 4771 art 1488 5748 my 3450 beloved 27 Son 5207; in 1722 thee 4671 I am well pleased 2106 5656. 

3:23 And 2532 Jesus 2424 himself 846 began 756 5734 to be 2258 5713 about 5616 thirty 5144 years of age 2094, being 5607 5752 (as 5613 was supposed 3543 5712) the son 5207 of Joseph 2501, which was [the son] of Heli 2242,

4:1 And 1161 Jesus 2424 being full 4134 of the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 returned 5290 5656 from 575 Jordan 2446, and 2532 was led 71 5712 by 1722 the Spirit 4151 into 1519 the wilderness 2048, 

4:2 Being 3985 0 forty 5062 days 2250 tempted 3985 5746 of 5259 the devil 1228. And 2532 in 1722 those 1565 days 2250 he did eat 5315 5627 nothing 3756 3762: and 2532 when they 846 were ended 4931 5685, he afterward 5305 hungered 3983 5656. 

4:3 And 2532 the devil 1228 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, If 1487 thou be 1488 5748 the Son 5207 of God 2316, command 2036 5628 this 5129 stone 3037 that 2443 it be made 1096 5638 bread 740. 

4:4 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 him 4314 846, saying 3004 5723, It is written 1125 5769, That 3754 man 444 shall 2198 0 not 3756 live 2198 5695 by 1909 bread 740 alone 3441, but 235 by 1909 every 3956 word 4487 of God 2316. 

4:5 And 2532 the devil 1228, taking 321 0 him 846 up 321 5631 into 1519 an high 5308 mountain 3735, shewed 1166 5656 unto him 846 all 3956 the kingdoms 932 of the world 3625 in 1722 a moment 4743 of time 5550. 

4:6 And 2532 the devil 1228 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, All 537 this 5026 power 1849 will I give 1325 5692 thee 4671, and 2532 the glory 1391 of them 846: for 3754 that is delivered 3860 5769 unto me 1698; and 2532 to 3739 whomsoever 1437 I will 2309 5725 I give 1325 5719 it 846. 

4:7 If 1437 thou 4771 therefore 3767 wilt worship 4352 5661 me 1799 3450, all 3956 shall be 2071 5704 thine 4675. 

4:8 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Get thee 5217 5720 behind 3694 me 3450, Satan 4567: for 1063 it is written 1125 5769, Thou shalt worship 4352 5692 the Lord 2962 thy 4675 God 2316, and 2532 him 846 only 3441 shalt thou serve 3000 5692. 

4:9 And 2532 he brought 71 5627 him 846 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419, and 2532 set 2476 5656 him 846 on 1909 a pinnacle 4419 of the temple 2411, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, If 1487 thou be 1488 5748 the Son 5207 of God 2316, cast 906 5628 thyself 4572 down 2736 from hence 1782: 

4:10 For 1063 3754 it is written 1125 5769, He shall give 1781 0 his 848 angels 32 charge 1781 5699 over 4012 thee 4675, to keep 1314 5658 thee 4571: 

4:11 And 2532 3754 in 1909 [their] hands 5495 they shall bear 142 0 thee 4571 up 142 5692, lest at any time 3379 thou dash 4350 5661 thy 4675 foot 4228 against 4314 a stone 3037. 

4:12 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, It is said 3754 2046 5769, Thou shalt 1598 0 not 3756 tempt 1598 5692 the Lord 2962 thy 4675 God 2316. 

4:13 And 2532 when the devil 1228 had ended 4931 5660 all 3956 the temptation 3986, he departed 868 5627 from 575 him 846 for 891 a season 2540. 

4:14 And 2532 Jesus 2424 returned 5290 5656 in 1722 the power 1411 of the Spirit 4151 into 1519 Galilee 1056: and 2532 there went out 1831 5627 a fame 5345 of 4012 him 846 through 2596 all 3650 the region round about 4066. 

4:15 And 2532 he taught 1321 5707 in 1722 their 846 synagogues 4864, being glorified 1392 5746 of 5259 all 3956. 

4:16 And 2532 he came 2064 5627 to 1519 Nazareth 3478, where 3757 he had been 2258 5713 brought up 5142 5772: and 2532, as 2596 0 his 846 custom 1486 5756 was 2596, he went 1525 5627 into 1519 the synagogue 4864 on 1722 the sabbath 4521 day 2250, and 2532 stood up 450 5627 for to read 314 5629. 

4:17 And 2532 there was delivered 1929 5681 unto him 846 the book 975 of the prophet 4396 Esaias 2268. And 2532 when he had opened 380 5660 the book 975, he found 2147 5627 the place 5117 where 3757 it was 2258 5713 written 1125 5772, 

4:18 The Spirit 4151 of the Lord 2962 [is] upon 1909 me 1691, because 1752 he hath anointed 5548 5656 me 3165 to preach the gospel 2097 5733 to the poor 4434; he hath sent 649 5758 me 3165 to heal 2390 5664 the brokenhearted 4937 5772 2588, to preach 2784 5658 deliverance 859 to the captives 164, and 2532 recovering of sight 309 to the blind 5185, to set 649 5658 at 1722 liberty 859 them that are bruised 2352 5772, 

4:19 To preach 2784 5658 the acceptable 1184 year 1763 of the Lord 2962. 

4:20 And 2532 he closed 4428 5660 the book 975, and he gave [it] again 591 5631 to the minister 5257, and sat down 2523 5656. And 2532 the eyes 3788 of all them 3956 that were 2258 5713 in 1722 the synagogue 4864 were fastened 816 5723 on him 846. 

4:21 And 1161 he began 756 5662 to say 3004 5721 unto 4314 them 846, This 3754 day 4594 is 4137 0 this 3778 scripture 1124 fulfilled 4137 5769 in 1722 your 5216 ears 3775. 

4:22 And 2532 all 3956 bare 3140 0 him 846 witness 3140 5707, and 2532 wondered 2296 5707 at 1909 the gracious 5485 words 3056 which 3588 proceeded 1607 5740 5734 out of 1537 his 846 mouth 4750. And 2532 they said 3004 5707, Is 2076 5748 not 3756 this 3778 Joseph's 2501 son 5207? 

4:23 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Ye will 2046 0 surely 3843 say 2046 5692 unto me 3427 this 5026 proverb 3850, Physician 2395, heal 2323 5657 thyself 4572: whatsoever 3745 we have heard 191 5656 done 1096 5637 in 1722 Capernaum 2584, do 4160 5657 also 2532 here 5602 in 1722 thy 4675 country 3968. 

4:24 And 1161 he said 2036 5627, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, 3754 No 3762 prophet 4396 is 2076 5748 accepted 1184 in 1722 his own 848 country 3968. 

4:25 But 1161 I tell 3004 5719 you 5213 of 1909 a truth 225, many 4183 widows 5503 were 2258 5713 in 1722 Israel 2474 in 1722 the days 2250 of Elias 2243, when 3753 the heaven 3772 was shut up 2808 5681 1909 three 5140 years 2094 and 2532 six 1803 months 3376, when 5613 great 3173 famine 3042 was 1096 5633 throughout 1909 all 3956 the land 1093; 

4:26 But 2532 unto 4314 none 3762 of them 846 was 3992 0 Elias 2243 sent 3992 5681, save 1508 unto 1519 Sarepta 4558, [a city] of Sidon 4605, unto 4314 a woman 1135 [that was] a widow 5503. 

4:27 And 2532 many 4183 lepers 3015 were 2258 5713 in 1722 Israel 2474 in the time 1909 of Eliseus 1666 the prophet 4396; and 2532 none 3762 of them 846 was cleansed 2511 5681, saving 1508 Naaman 3497 the Syrian 4948. 

4:28 And 2532 all they 3956 in 1722 the synagogue 4864, when they heard 191 5723 these things 5023, were filled 4130 5681 with wrath 2372, 

4:29 And 2532 rose up 450 5631, and thrust 1544 5627 him 846 out of 1854 the city 4172, and 2532 led 71 5627 him 846 unto 2193 the brow 3790 of the hill 3735 whereon 1909 3739 their 846 city 4172 was built 3618 5718, that 1519 they might cast 2630 0 him 846 down headlong 2630 5658. 

4:30 But 1161 he passing 1330 5631 through 1223 the midst 3319 of them 846 went his way 4198 5711, 

4:31 And 2532 came down 2718 5627 to 1519 Capernaum 2584, a city 4172 of Galilee 1056, and 2532 taught 1321 5723 them 846 2258 5713 on 1722 the sabbath days 4521. 

4:32 And 2532 they were astonished 1605 5712 at 1909 his 846 doctrine 1322: for 3754 his 846 word 3056 was 2258 5713 with 1722 power 1849. 

4:33 And 2532 in 1722 the synagogue 4864 there was 2258 5713 a man 444, which had 2192 5723 a spirit 4151 of an unclean 169 devil 1140, and 2532 cried out 349 5656 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, 

4:34 Saying 3004 5723, Let [us] alone 1436; what 5101 have we to do 2254 with thee 4671, 2532 [thou] Jesus 2424 of Nazareth 3479? art thou come 2064 5627 to destroy 622 5658 us 2248? I know 1492 5758 thee 4571 who 5101 thou art 1488 5748; the Holy One 40 of God 2316. 

4:35 And 2532 Jesus 2424 rebuked 2008 5656 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Hold thy peace 5392 5682, and 2532 come 1831 5628 out of 1537 him 846. And 2532 when the devil 1140 had thrown 4496 5660 him 846 in 1519 the midst 3319, he came 1831 5627 out of 575 him 846, and hurt 984 5660 him 846 not 3367. 

4:36 And 2532 they were 1096 5633 all 1909 3956 amazed 2285, and 2532 spake 4814 5707 among 4314 themselves 240, saying 3004 5723, What 5101 a word 3056 [is] this 3778! for 3754 with 1722 authority 1849 and 2532 power 1411 he commandeth 2004 5719 the unclean 169 spirits 4151, and 2532 they come out 1831 5736. 

4:37 And 2532 the fame 2279 of 4012 him 846 went out 1607 5711 into 1519 every 3956 place 5117 of the country round about 4066. 

4:38 And 1161 he arose 450 5631 out of 1537 the synagogue 4864, and entered 1525 5627 into 1519 Simon's 4613 house 3614. And 1161 Simon's 4613 wife's mother 3994 was 2258 5713 taken with 4912 5746 a great 3173 fever 4446; and 2532 they besought 2065 5656 him 846 for 4012 her 846. 

4:39 And 2532 he stood 2186 5631 over 1883 her 846, and rebuked 2008 5656 the fever 4446; and 2532 it left 863 5656 her 846: and immediately 3916 she arose 450 5631 and 1161 ministered 1247 5707 unto them 846. 

4:40 Now 1161 when the sun 2246 was setting 1416 5723, all 3956 they that 3745 had 2192 5707 any sick 770 5723 with divers 4164 diseases 3554 brought 71 5627 them 846 unto 4314 him 846; and 1161 he laid 2007 0 his hands 5495 on 2007 5631 every 1538 one 1520 of them 846, and healed 2323 5656 them 846. 

4:41 And 1161 devils 1140 also 2532 came 1831 5711 out of 575 many 4183, crying out 2896 5723, and 2532 saying 3004 5723, 3754 Thou 4771 art 1488 5748 Christ 5547 the Son 5207 of God 2316. And 2532 he rebuking 2008 5723 [them] suffered 1439 5707 them 846 not 3756 to speak 2980 5721: for 3754 they knew 1492 5715 that he 846 was 1511 5750 Christ 5547. 

4:42 And 1161 when it was 1096 5637 day 2250, he departed 1831 5631 and went 4198 5675 into 1519 a desert 2048 place 5117: and 2532 the people 3793 sought 2212 5707 him 846, and 2532 came 2064 5627 unto 2193 him 846, and 2532 stayed 2722 5707 him 846, that he should not 3361 depart 4198 5738 from 575 them 846. 

4:43 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, 3754 I 3165 must 1163 5748 preach 2097 5670 the kingdom 932 of God 2316 to other 2087 cities 4172 also 2532: for 3754 therefore 1519 5124 am I sent 649 5769. 

4:44 And 2532 he preached 2258 5713 2784 5723 in 1722 the synagogues 4864 of Galilee 1056. 

5:1 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, that, as 1722 the people 3793 pressed upon 1945 5738 him 846 to hear 191 5721 the word 3056 of God 2316, 2532 he 846 stood 2258 5713 2476 5761 by 3844 the lake 3041 of Gennesaret 1082, 

5:2 And 2532 saw 1492 5627 two 1417 ships 4143 standing 2476 5761 by 3844 the lake 3041: but 1161 the fishermen 231 were gone 576 5631 out of 575 them 846, and were washing 637 5656 [their] nets 1350. 

5:3 And 1161 he entered 1684 5631 into 1519 one 1520 of the ships 4143, which 3739 was 2258 5713 Simon's 4613, and prayed 2065 5656 him 846 that he would thrust out 1877 5629 a little 3641 from 575 the land 1093. And 2532 he sat down 2523 5660, and taught 1321 5707 the people 3793 out of 1537 the ship 4143. 

5:4 Now 1161 when 5613 he had left 3973 5668 speaking 2980 5723, he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 Simon 4613, Launch out 1877 5628 into 1519 the deep 899, and 2532 let down 5465 5657 your 5216 nets 1350 for 1519 a draught 61. 

5:5 And 2532 Simon 4613 answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Master 1988, we have toiled 2872 5660 all 3650 1223 the night 3571, and have taken 2983 5627 nothing 3762: nevertheless 1161 at 1909 thy 4675 word 4487 I will let down 5465 5692 the net 1350. 

5:6 And 2532 when they had 4160 0 this 5124 done 4160 5660, they inclosed 4788 5656 a great 4183 multitude 4128 of fishes 2486: and 1161 their 846 net 1350 brake 1284 5712. 

5:7 And 2532 they beckoned 2656 5656 unto [their] partners 3353, which 3588 were in 1722 the other 2087 ship 4143, that they should come 2064 5631 and help 4815 5641 them 846. And 2532 they came 2064 5627, and 2532 filled 4130 5656 both 297 the ships 4143, so 5620 that they began to sink 1036 5745. 

5:8 When 1161 Simon 4613 Peter 4074 saw 1492 5631 [it], he fell down at 4363 5627 Jesus 2424' knees 1119, saying 3004 5723, Depart 1831 5628 from 575 me 1700; for 3754 I am 1510 5748 a sinful 268 man 435, O Lord 2962. 

5:9 For 1063 he was astonished 4023 5627 2285, and 2532 all 3956 that were 4862 with him 846, at 1909 the draught 61 of the fishes 2486 which 3739 they had taken 4815 5627: 

5:10 And 1161 so 3668 [was] also 2532 James 2385, and 2532 John 2491, the sons 5207 of Zebedee 2199, which 3739 were 2258 5713 partners 2844 with Simon 4613. And 2532 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 Simon 4613, Fear 5399 5732 5737 not 3361; from 575 henceforth 3568 thou shalt 2071 5704 catch 2221 5723 men 444. 

5:11 And 2532 when they had brought 2609 5631 their ships 4143 to 1909 land 1093, they forsook 863 5631 all 537, and followed 190 5656 him 846. 

5:12 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, when he 846 was 1511 5750 1722 in 1722 a certain 3391 city 4172, 2532 behold 2400 5628 a man 435 full 4134 of leprosy 3014: who 2532 seeing 1492 5631 Jesus 2424 fell 4098 5631 on 1909 [his] face 4383, and besought 1189 5681 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962, if 1437 thou wilt 2309 5725, thou canst 1410 5736 make 2511 0 me 3165 clean 2511 5658. 

5:13 And 2532 he put forth 1614 5660 [his] hand 5495, and touched 680 5662 him 846, saying 2036 5631, I will 2309 5719: be thou clean 2511 5682. And 2532 immediately 2112 the leprosy 3014 departed 565 5627 from 575 him 846. 

5:14 And 2532 he 846 charged 3853 5656 him 846 to tell 2036 5629 no man 3367: but 235 go 565 5631, and shew 1166 5657 thyself 4572 to the priest 2409, and 2532 offer 4374 5628 for 4012 thy 4675 cleansing 2512, according as 2531 Moses 3475 commanded 4367 5656, for 1519 a testimony 3142 unto them 846. 

5:15 But 1161 so much the more 3123 went there 1330 0 a fame 3056 abroad 1330 5711 of 4012 him 846: and 2532 great 4183 multitudes 3793 came together 4905 5711 to hear 191 5721, and 2532 to be healed 2323 5745 by 5259 him 846 of 575 their 848 infirmities 769. 

5:16 And 1161 he withdrew 2258 5713 5298 5723 himself 846 into 1722 the wilderness 2048, and 2532 prayed 4336 5740. 

5:17 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633 on 1722 a certain 3391 day 2250, as 2532 he 846 was 2258 5713 teaching 1321 5723, that 2532 there were 2258 5713 Pharisees 5330 and 2532 doctors of the law 3547 sitting by 2521 5740, which 3739 were 2258 5713 come 2064 5756 out of 1537 every 3956 town 2968 of Galilee 1056, and 2532 Judaea 2449, and 2532 Jerusalem 2419: and 2532 the power 1411 of the Lord 2962 was 2258 5713 [present] to 1519 heal 2390 5738 them 846. 

5:18 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, men 435 brought 5342 5723 in 1909 a bed 2825 a man 444 which 3739 was 2258 5713 taken with a palsy 3886 5772: and 2532 they sought 2212 5707 [means] to bring 1533 0 him 846 in 1533 5629, and 2532 to lay 5087 5629 [him] before 1799 him 846. 

5:19 And 2532 when they could 2147 0 not 3361 find 2147 5631 by 1223 what 4169 [way] they might bring 1533 0 him 846 in 1533 5632 because 1223 of the multitude 3793, they went 305 5631 upon 1909 the housetop 1430, and let 2524 0 him 846 down 2524 5656 through 1223 the tiling 2766 with 4862 [his] couch 2826 into 1519 the midst 3319 before 1715 Jesus 2424. 

5:20 And 2532 when he saw 1492 5631 their 846 faith 4102, he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Man 444, thy 4675 sins 266 are forgiven 863 5769 thee 4671. 

5:21 And 2532 the scribes 1122 and 2532 the Pharisees 5330 began 756 5662 to reason 1260 5738, saying 3004 5723, Who 5101 is 2076 5748 this 3778 which 3739 speaketh 2980 5719 blasphemies 988? Who 5101 can 1410 5736 forgive 863 5721 sins 266, but 1508 God 2316 alone 3441? 

5:22 But 1161 when Jesus 2424 perceived 1921 5631 their 846 thoughts 1261, he answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, What 5101 reason ye 1260 5736 in 1722 your 5216 hearts 2588? 

5:23 Whether 5101 is 2076 5748 easier 2123, to say 2036 5629, Thy 4675 sins 266 be forgiven 863 5769 thee 4671; or 2228 to say 2036 5629, Rise up 1453 5669 and 2532 walk 4043 5720? 

5:24 But 1161 that 2443 ye may know 1492 5762 that 3754 the Son 5207 of man 444 hath 2192 5719 power 1849 upon 1909 earth 1093 to forgive 863 5721 sins 266, (he said 2036 5627 unto the sick of the palsy 3886 5772) I say 3004 5719 unto thee 4671, Arise 1453 5669, and 2532 take up 142 5660 thy 4675 couch 2826, and go 4198 5737 into 1519 thine 4675 house 3624. 

5:25 And 2532 immediately 3916 he rose up 450 5631 before 1799 them 846, and took up 142 5660 that whereon 1909 3739 he lay 2621 5711, and departed 565 5627 to 1519 his own 848 house 3624, glorifying 1392 5723 God 2316. 

5:26 And 2532 they were 2983 5627 all 537 amazed 1611, and 2532 they glorified 1392 5707 God 2316, and 2532 were filled 4130 5681 with fear 5401, saying 3004 5723, 3754 We have seen 1492 5627 strange things 3861 to day 4594. 

5:27 And 2532 after 3326 these things 5023 he went forth 1831 5627, and 2532 saw 2300 5662 a publican 5057, named 3686 Levi 3018, sitting 2521 5740 at 1909 the receipt of custom 5058: and 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Follow 190 5720 me 3427. 

5:28 And 2532 he left 2641 5631 all 537, rose up 450 5631, and followed 190 5656 him 846. 

5:29 And 2532 Levi 3018 made 4160 5656 him 846 a great 3173 feast 1403 in 1722 his own 848 house 3614: and 2532 there was 2258 5713 a great 4183 company 3793 of publicans 5057 and 2532 of others 243 that 3739 sat down 2621 5740 with 3326 them 846. 

5:30 But 2532 their 846 scribes 1122 and 2532 Pharisees 5330 murmured 1111 5707 against 4314 his 846 disciples 3101, saying 3004 5723, Why 1302 do ye eat 2068 5719 and 2532 drink 4095 5719 with 3326 publicans 5057 and 2532 sinners 268? 

5:31 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, They that are whole 5198 5723 need 5532 2192 5719 not 3756 a physician 2395; but 235 they that are 2192 5723 sick 2560. 

5:32 I came 2064 5754 not 3756 to call 2564 5658 the righteous 1342, but 235 sinners 268 to 1519 repentance 3341. 

5:33 And 1161 they said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Why 1302 do 3522 0 the disciples 3101 of John 2491 fast 3522 5719 often 4437, and 2532 make 4160 5731 prayers 1162, and 2532 likewise 3668 [the disciples 3588] of the Pharisees 5330; but 1161 thine 4674 eat 2068 5719 and 2532 drink 4095 5719? 

5:34 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, 3361 Can ye 1410 5736 make 4160 5658 the children 5207 of the bridechamber 3567 fast 3522 5721, while 3739 1722 the bridegroom 3566 is 2076 5748 with 3326 them 846? 

5:35 But 1161 the days 2250 will come 2064 5695, when 3752 2532 the bridegroom 3566 shall be taken away 522 5686 from 575 them 846, and then 5119 shall they fast 3522 5692 in 1722 those 1565 days 2250. 

5:36 And 1161 he spake 3004 5707 also 2532 a parable 3850 unto 4314 them 846; 3754 No man 3762 putteth 1911 5719 a piece 1915 of a new 2537 garment 2440 upon 1909 an old 3820; if otherwise, then 1490 both 2532 the new 2537 maketh a rent 4977 5719, and 2532 the piece 1915 that was [taken] out of 575 the new 2537 agreeth 4856 5719 not 3756 with the old 3820. 

5:37 And 2532 no man 3762 putteth 906 5719 new 3501 wine 3631 into 1519 old 3820 bottles 779; else 1490 the new 3501 wine 3631 will burst 4486 5692 the bottles 779, and 2532 be spilled 1632 5701, and 2532 the bottles 779 shall perish 622 5698. 

5:38 But 235 new 3501 wine 3631 must be put 992 into 1519 new 2537 bottles 779; and 2532 both 297 are preserved 4933 5743. 

5:39 No man 3762 also 2532 having drunk 4095 5631 old 3820 [wine] straightway 2112 desireth 2309 5719 new 3501: for 1063 he saith 3004 5719, The old 3820 is 2076 5748 better 5543. 

6:1 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633 on 1722 the second 1207 0 sabbath 4521 after the first 1207, that he 846 went 1279 5738 through 1223 the corn fields 4702; and 2532 his 846 disciples 3101 plucked 5089 5707 the ears of corn 4719, and 2532 did eat 2068 5707, rubbing 5597 5723 [them] in [their] hands 5495. 

6:2 And 1161 certain 5100 of the Pharisees 5330 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Why 5101 do ye 4160 5719 that which 3739 is 1832 0 not 3756 lawful 1832 5748 to do 4160 5721 on 1722 the sabbath days 4521? 

6:3 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answering 611 5679 them 4314 846 said 2036 5627, Have ye 314 0 not 3761 0 read 314 5627 so much as 3761 this 5124, what 3739 David 1138 did 4160 5656, when 3698 himself 846 was an hungred 3983 5656, and 2532 they which 3588 were 5607 5752 with 3326 him 846; 

6:4 How 5613 he went 1525 5627 into 1519 the house 3624 of God 2316, and 2532 did take 2983 5627 and 2532 eat 5315 5627 the shewbread 740 4286, and 2532 gave 1325 5656 also 2532 to them that were with 3326 him 846; which 3739 it is 1832 0 not 3756 lawful 1832 5748 to eat 5315 5629 but for 1508 the priests 2409 alone 3441? 

6:5 And 2532 he said 3004 5707 unto them 846, That 3754 the Son 5207 of man 444 is 2076 5748 Lord 2962 also 2532 of the sabbath 4521. 

6:6 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633 also 2532 on 1722 another 2087 sabbath 4521, that he 846 entered 1525 5629 into 1519 the synagogue 4864 and 2532 taught 1321 5721: and 2532 there 1563 was 2258 5713 a man 444 whose 2532 846 right 1188 hand 5495 was 2258 5713 withered 3584. 

6:7 And 1161 the scribes 1122 and 2532 Pharisees 5330 watched 3906 5707 him 846, whether 1487 he would heal 2323 5692 on 1722 the sabbath day 4521; that 2443 they might find 2147 5627 an accusation 2724 against him 846. 

6:8 But 1161 he knew 1492 5715 their 846 thoughts 1261, and 2532 said 2036 5627 to the man 444 which 3588 had 2192 5723 the withered 3584 hand 5495, Rise up 1453 5669, and 2532 stand forth 2476 5628 in 1519 the midst 3319. And 1161 he arose 450 5631 and stood forth 2476 5627. 

6:9 Then 3767 said 2036 5627 Jesus 2424 unto 4314 them 846, I will ask 1905 5692 you 5209 one thing 5101; Is it lawful 1832 5748 on the sabbath days 4521 to do good 15 5658, or 2228 to do evil 2554 5658? to save 4982 5658 life 5590, or 2228 to destroy 622 5658 [it]? 

6:10 And 2532 looking round about upon 4017 5671 them 846 all 3956, he said 2036 5627 unto the man 444, Stretch forth 1614 5657 thy 4675 hand 5495. And 1161 he did 4160 5656 so 3779: and 2532 his 846 hand 5495 was restored 600 5681 whole 5199 as 5613 the other 243. 

6:11 And 1161 they were filled 4130 5681 with madness 454; and 2532 communed 1255 5707 one with another 4314 240 what 5101 302 they might do 4160 5659 to Jesus 2424. 

6:12 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633 in 1722 those 5025 days 2250, that he went out 1831 5627 into 1519 a mountain 3735 to pray 4336 5664, and 2532 continued all night 1273 5723 2258 5713 in 1722 prayer 4335 to God 2316. 

6:13 And 2532 when 3753 it was 1096 5633 day 2250, he called 4377 5656 [unto him] his 848 disciples 3101: and 2532 of 575 them 846 he chose 1586 5671 twelve 1427, whom 3739 also 2532 he named 3687 5656 apostles 652; 

6:14 Simon 4613, (whom 3739 he also 2532 named 3687 5656 Peter 4074) and 2532 Andrew 406 his 846 brother 80, James 2385 and 2532 John 2491, Philip 5376 and 2532 Bartholomew 918, 

6:15 Matthew 3156 and 2532 Thomas 2381, James 2385 the 3588 [son] of Alphaeus 256, and 2532 Simon 4613 called 2564 5746 Zelotes 2208, 

6:16 And Judas 2455 [the brother] of James 2385, and 2532 Judas 2455 Iscariot 2469, which 3739 also 2532 was 1096 5633 the traitor 4273. 

6:17 And 2532 he came down 2597 5631 with 3326 them 846, and stood 2476 5627 in 1909 the plain 3977 5117, and 2532 the company 3793 of his 846 disciples 3101, and 2532 a great 4183 multitude 4128 of people 2992 out of 575 all 3956 Judaea 2449 and 2532 Jerusalem 2419, and 2532 from the sea coast 3882 of Tyre 5184 and 2532 Sidon 4605, which 3739 came 2064 5627 to hear 191 5658 him 846, and 2532 to be healed 2390 5683 of 575 their 848 diseases 3554; 

6:18 And 2532 they that were vexed 3791 5746 with 5259 unclean 169 spirits 4151: and 2532 they were healed 2323 5712. 

6:19 And 2532 the whole 3956 multitude 3793 sought 2212 5707 to touch 680 5733 him 846: for 3754 there went 1831 5711 virtue 1411 out 3844 of him 846, and 2532 healed 2390 5711 [them] all 3956. 

6:20 And 2532 he 846 lifted up 1869 5660 his 848 eyes 3788 on 1519 his 848 disciples 3101, and said 3004 5707, Blessed 3107 [be ye] poor 4434: for 3754 yours 5212 is 2076 5748 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. 

6:21 Blessed 3107 [are ye] that hunger 3983 5723 now 3568: for 3754 ye shall be filled 5526 5701. Blessed 3107 [are ye] that weep 2799 5723 now 3568: for 3754 ye shall laugh 1070 5692. 

6:22 Blessed 3107 are ye 2075 5748, when 3752 men 444 shall hate 3404 5661 you 5209, and 2532 when 3752 they shall separate 873 5661 you 5209 [from their company], and 2532 shall reproach 3679 5661 [you], and 2532 cast out 1544 5632 your 5216 name 3686 as 5613 evil 4190, for the Son 5207 of man's 444 sake 1752. 

6:23 Rejoice ye 5463 5720 in 1722 that 1565 day 2250, and 2532 leap for joy 4640 5657: for 1063, behold 2400 5628, your 5216 reward 3408 [is] great 4183 in 1722 heaven 3772: for 1063 in 2596 the like manner 5024 did 4160 5707 their 846 fathers 3962 unto the prophets 4396. 

6:24 But 4133 woe 3759 unto you 5213 that are rich 4145! for 3754 ye have received 568 5719 your 5216 consolation 3874. 

6:25 Woe 3759 unto you 5213 that are full 1705 5772! for 3754 ye shall hunger 3983 5692. Woe 3759 unto you 5213 that laugh 1070 5723 now 3568! for 3754 ye shall mourn 3996 5692 and 2532 weep 2799 5692. 

6:26 Woe 3759 unto you 5213, when 3752 all 3956 men 444 shall speak 2036 5632 well 2573 of you 5209! for 1063 so 5024 2596 did 4160 5707 their 846 fathers 3962 to the false prophets 5578. 

6:27 But 235 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213 which 3588 hear 191 5723, Love 25 5720 your 5216 enemies 2190, do 4160 5720 good 2573 to them which 3588 hate 3404 5723 you 5209, 

6:28 Bless 2127 5720 them that curse 2672 5740 you 5213, and 2532 pray 4336 5737 for 5228 them which despitefully use 1908 5723 you 5209. 

6:29 And unto him that smiteth 5180 5723 thee 4571 on 1909 the [one] cheek 4600 offer 3930 5720 also 2532 the other 243; and 2532 him 575 that taketh away 142 5723 thy 4675 cloke 2440 forbid 2967 5661 not 3361 [to take thy] coat 5509 also 2532. 

6:30 1161 Give 1325 5720 to every man 3956 that asketh 154 5723 of thee 4571; and 2532 of 575 him that taketh away 142 5723 thy goods 4674 ask 523 0 [them] not 3361 again 523 5720. 

6:31 And 2532 as 2531 ye would 2309 5719 that 2443 men 444 should do 4160 5725 to you 5213, do 4160 5720 ye 5210 also 2532 to them 846 likewise 3668. 

6:32 For 2532 if 1487 ye love 25 5719 them which love 25 5723 you 5209, what 4169 thank 5485 have 2076 5748 ye 5213? for 1063 sinners 268 also 2532 love 25 5723 those that love 25 5719 them 846. 

6:33 And 2532 if 1437 ye do good 15 5725 to them which do good 15 5723 to you 5209, what 4169 thank 5485 have 2076 5748 ye 5213? for 1063 sinners 268 also do 4160 5719 even 2532 the same 846. 

6:34 And 2532 if 1437 ye lend 1155 5725 [to them] of 3844 whom 3739 ye hope 1679 5719 5625 1679 5725 to receive 618 5629, what 4169 thank 5485 have 2076 5748 ye 5213? for 1063 sinners 268 also 2532 lend 1155 5719 to sinners 268, to 2443 receive 618 0 as much 2470 again 618 5632. 

6:35 But 4133 love ye 25 5720 your 5216 enemies 2190, and 2532 do good 15 5720, and 2532 lend 1155 5720, hoping 560 0 for nothing 3367 again 560 5723; and 2532 your 5216 reward 3408 shall be 2071 5704 great 4183, and 2532 ye shall be 2071 5704 the children 5207 of the Highest 5310: for 3754 he 846 is 2076 5748 kind 5543 unto 1909 the unthankful 884 and 2532 [to] the evil 4190. 

6:36 Be ye 1096 5737 therefore 3767 merciful 3629, as 2531 your 5216 Father 3962 also 2532 is 2076 5748 merciful 3629. 

6:37 2532 Judge 2919 5720 not 3361, and 2532 ye shall 2919 0 not 3364 be judged 2919 5686: condemn 2613 5720 not 3361, and 2532 ye shall 2613 0 not 3364 be condemned 2613 5686: forgive 630 5720, and 2532 ye shall be forgiven 630 5701: 

6:38 Give 1325 5720, and 2532 it shall be given 1325 5701 unto you 5213; good 2570 measure 3358, pressed down 4085 5772, and 2532 shaken together 4531 5772, and 2532 running over 5240 5746, shall men give 1325 5692 into 1519 your 5216 bosom 2859. For 1063 with the same 846 measure 3358 that 3739 ye mete withal 3354 5719 it shall be measured 488 0 to you 5213 again 488 5701. 

6:39 And 1161 he spake 2036 5627 a parable 3850 unto them 846, 3385 Can 1410 5736 the blind 5185 lead 3594 5721 the blind 5185? shall they 297 0 not 3780 both 297 fall 4098 5699 into 1519 the ditch 999? 

6:40 The disciple 3101 is 2076 5748 not 3756 above 5228 his 848 master 1320: but 1161 every one 3956 that is perfect 2675 5772 shall be 2071 5704 as 5613 his 846 master 1320. 

6:41 And 1161 why 5101 beholdest thou 991 5719 the mote 2595 that is in 1722 thy 4675 brother's 80 eye 3788, but 1161 perceivest 2657 5719 not 3756 the beam 1385 that is in 1722 thine own 2398 eye 3788? 

6:42 Either 2228 how 4459 canst thou 1410 5736 say 3004 5721 to thy 4675 brother 80, Brother 80, let me 863 5628 pull out 1544 5632 the mote 2595 that is in 1722 thine 4675 eye 3788, when thou 991 0 thyself 846 beholdest 991 5723 not 3756 the beam 1385 that is in 1722 thine 4675 own eye 3788? Thou hypocrite 5273, cast out 1544 5628 first 4412 the beam 1385 out of 1537 thine own 4675 eye 3788, and 2532 then 5119 shalt thou see clearly 1227 5692 to pull out 1544 5629 the mote 2595 that is in 1722 thy 4675 brother's 80 eye 3788. 

6:43 For 1063 a good 2570 tree 1186 bringeth 2076 5748 4160 0 not 3756 forth 4160 5723 corrupt 4550 fruit 2590; neither 3761 doth 4160 0 a corrupt 4550 tree 1186 bring forth 4160 5723 good 2570 fruit 2590. 

6:44 For 1063 every 1538 tree 1186 is known 1097 5743 by 1537 his own 2398 fruit 2590. For 1063 of 1537 thorns 173 men do not 3756 gather 4816 5719 figs 4810, nor 3761 of 1537 a bramble bush 942 gather they 5166 5719 grapes 4718. 

6:45 A good 18 man 444 out of 1537 the good 18 treasure 2344 of his 848 heart 2588 bringeth forth 4393 5719 that which is good 18; and 2532 an evil 4190 man 444 out of 1537 the evil 4190 treasure 2344 of his 848 heart 2588 bringeth forth 4393 5719 that which is evil 4190: for 1063 of 1537 the abundance 4051 of the heart 2588 his 846 mouth 4750 speaketh 2980 5719. 

6:46 And 1161 why 5101 call ye 2564 5719 me 3165, Lord 2962, Lord 2962, and 2532 do 4160 5719 not 3756 the things which 3739 I say 3004 5719? 

6:47 Whosoever 3956 cometh 2064 5740 to 4314 me 3165, and 2532 heareth 191 5723 my 3450 sayings 3056, and 2532 doeth 4160 5723 them 846, I will shew 5263 5692 you 5213 to whom 5101 he is 2076 5748 like 3664: 

6:48 He is 2076 5748 like 3664 a man 444 which 3739 built 3618 5723 an house 3614, and 2532 digged 4626 5656 deep 900 5656, and 2532 laid 5087 5656 the foundation 2310 on 1909 a rock 4073: and 1161 when the flood 4132 arose 1096 5637, the stream 4215 beat vehemently 4366 5656 upon that 1565 house 3614, and 2532 could 2480 5656 not 3756 shake 4531 5658 it 846: for 1063 it was founded 2311 5718 upon 1909 a rock 4073. 

6:49 But 1161 he that heareth 191 5660, and 2532 doeth 4160 5660 not 3361, is 2076 5748 like 3664 a man 444 that without 5565 a foundation 2310 built 3618 5660 an house 3614 upon 1909 the earth 1093; against 4366 0 which 3739 the stream 4215 did beat vehemently 4366 5656, and 2532 immediately 2112 it fell 4098 5627; and 2532 the ruin 4485 of that 1565 house 3614 was 1096 5633 great 3173. 

7:1 Now 1161 when 1893 he had ended 4137 5656 all 3956 his 848 sayings 4487 in 1519 the audience 189 of the people 2992, he entered 1525 5627 into 1519 Capernaum 2584. 

7:2 And 1161 a certain 5100 centurion's 1543 servant 1401, who 3739 was 2258 5713 dear 1784 unto him 846, was 2192 5723 sick 2560, and ready 3195 5707 to die 5053 5721. 

7:3 And 1161 when he heard 191 5660 of 4012 Jesus 2424, he sent 649 5656 unto 4314 him 846 the elders 4245 of the Jews 2453, beseeching 2065 5723 him 846 that 3704 he would come 2064 5631 and heal 1295 5661 his 848 servant 1401. 

7:4 And 1161 when they came 3854 5637 to 4314 Jesus 2424, they besought 3870 5707 him 846 instantly 4709, saying 3004 5723, That 3754 he was 2076 5748 worthy 514 for whom 3739 he should do 3930 5692 this 5124: 

7:5 For 1063 he loveth 25 5719 our 2257 nation 1484, and 2532 he 846 hath built 3618 5656 us 2254 a synagogue 4864. 

7:6 Then 1161 Jesus 2424 went 4198 5711 with 4862 them 846. And 1161 when he was 568 5723 now 2235 not 3756 far 3112 from 575 the house 3614, the centurion 1543 sent 3992 5656 friends 5384 to 4314 him 846, saying 3004 5723 unto him 846, Lord 2962, trouble 4660 0 not 3361 thyself 4660 5744: for 1063 I am 1510 5748 not 3756 worthy 2425 that 2443 thou shouldest enter 1525 5632 under 5259 my 3450 roof 4721: 

7:7 Wherefore 1352 neither 3761 thought I 515 0 myself 1683 worthy 515 5656 to come 2064 5629 unto 4314 thee 4571: but 235 say 2036 5628 in a word 3056, and 2532 my 3450 servant 3816 shall be healed 2390 5701. 

7:8 For 1063 I 1473 also 2532 am 1510 5748 a man 444 set 5021 5746 under 5259 authority 1849, having 2192 5723 under 5259 me 1683 soldiers 4757, and 2532 I say 3004 5719 unto one 5129, Go 4198 5676, and 2532 he goeth 4198 5736; and 2532 to another 243, Come 2064 5736, and 2532 he cometh 2064 5736; and 2532 to my 3450 servant 1401, Do 4160 5657 this 5124, and 2532 he doeth 4160 5719 [it]. 

7:9 When 1161 Jesus 2424 heard 191 5660 these things 5023, he marvelled 2296 5656 at him 846, and 2532 turned him about 4762 5651, and said 2036 5627 unto the people 3793 that followed 190 5723 him 846, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, I have not found 2147 5627 so great 5118 faith 4102, no, not 3761 in 1722 Israel 2474. 

7:10 And 2532 they that were sent 3992 5685, returning 5290 5660 to 1519 the house 3624, found 2147 5627 the servant 1401 whole 5198 5723 that had been sick 770 5723. 

7:11 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633 1722 the day after 1836, that he went 4198 5711 into 1519 a city 4172 called 2564 5746 Nain 3484; and 2532 many 2425 of his 846 disciples 3101 went with 4848 5711 him 846, and 2532 much 4183 people 3793. 

7:12 Now 1161 when 5613 he came nigh 1448 5656 to the gate 4439 of the city 4172, behold 2532 2400 5628, there was 1580 0 a dead man 2348 5761 carried out 1580 5712, the only 3439 son 5207 of his 848 mother 3384, and 2532 she 3778 was 2258 5713 a widow 5503: and 2532 much 2425 people 3793 of the city 4172 was 2258 5713 with 4862 her 846. 

7:13 And 2532 when the Lord 2962 saw 1492 5631 her 846, he had compassion 4697 5675 on 1909 her 846, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto her 846, Weep 2799 5720 not 3361. 

7:14 And 2532 he came 4334 5631 and touched 680 5662 the bier 4673: and 1161 they that bare 941 5723 [him] stood still 2476 5627. And 2532 he said 2036 5627, Young man 3495, I say 3004 5719 unto thee 4671, Arise 1453 5682. 

7:15 And 2532 he that was dead 3498 sat up 339 5656, and 2532 began 756 5662 to speak 2980 5721. And 2532 he delivered 1325 5656 him 846 to his 846 mother 3384. 

7:16 And 1161 there came 2983 5627 a fear 5401 on all 537: and 2532 they glorified 1392 5707 God 2316, saying 3004 5723, That 3754 a great 3173 prophet 4396 is risen up 1453 5769 among 1722 us 2254; and 2532, That 3754 God 2316 hath visited 1980 5662 his 848 people 2992. 

7:17 And 2532 this 3778 rumour 3056 of 4012 him 846 went forth 1831 5627 throughout 1722 all 3650 Judaea 2449, and 2532 throughout 1722 all 3956 the region round about 4066. 

7:18 And 2532 the disciples 3101 of John 2491 shewed 518 5656 him 846 of 4012 all 3956 these things 5130. 

7:19 And 2532 John 2491 calling 4341 5666 [unto him] two 1417 5100 of his 848 disciples 3101 sent 3992 5656 [them] to 4314 Jesus 2424, saying 3004 5723, Art 1488 5748 thou 4771 he that should come 2064 5740? or 2228 look we for 4328 5719 5725 another 243? 

7:20 When 1161 the men 435 were come 3854 5637 unto 4314 him 846, they said 2036 5627, John 2491 Baptist 910 hath sent 649 5758 us 2248 unto 4314 thee 4571, saying 3004 5723, Art 1488 5748 thou 4771 he that should come 2064 5740? or 2228 look we for 4328 5719 5725 another 243? 

7:21 And 1161 in 1722 that same 846 hour 5610 he cured 2323 5656 many 4183 of 575 [their] infirmities 3554 and 2532 plagues 3148, and 2532 of evil 4190 spirits 4151; and 2532 unto many 4183 [that were] blind 5185 he gave 5483 5662 sight 991 5721. 

7:22 Then 2532 Jesus 2424 answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Go your way 4198 5679, and tell 518 5657 John 2491 what things 3739 ye have seen 1492 5627 and 2532 heard 191 5656; how 3754 that the blind 5185 see 308 5719, the lame 5560 walk 4043 5719, the lepers 3015 are cleansed 2511 5743, the deaf 2974 hear 191 5719, the dead 3498 are raised 1453 5743, to the poor 4434 the gospel is preached 2097 5743. 

7:23 And 2532 blessed 3107 is 2076 5748 [he], whosoever 3362 0 shall 4624 0 not 3362 be offended 4624 5686 in 1722 me 1698. 

7:24 And 1161 when the messengers 32 of John 2491 were departed 565 5631, he began 756 5662 to speak 3004 5721 unto 4314 the people 3793 concerning 4012 John 2491, What 5101 went ye out 1831 5758 into 1519 the wilderness 2048 for to see 2300 5664? A reed 2563 shaken 4531 5746 with 5259 the wind 417? 

7:25 But 235 what 5101 went ye out 1831 5758 for to see 1492 5629? A man 444 clothed 294 5772 in 1722 soft 3120 raiment 2440? Behold 2400 5628, they which are 1722 gorgeously 1741 apparelled 2441, and 2532 live 5225 5723 delicately 5172, are 1526 5748 in 1722 kings' courts 933. 

7:26 But 235 what 5101 went ye out 1831 5758 for to see 1492 5629? A prophet 4396? Yea 3483, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, and 2532 much more 4055 than a prophet 4396. 

7:27 This 3778 is 2076 5748 [he], of 4012 whom 3739 it is written 1125 5769, Behold 2400 5628, I 1473 send 649 5719 my 3450 messenger 32 before 4253 thy 4675 face 4383, which 3739 shall prepare 2680 5692 thy 4675 way 3598 before 1715 thee 4675. 

7:28 For 1063 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Among 1722 those that are born 1084 of women 1135 there is 2076 5748 not 3762 a greater 3187 0 prophet 4396 than 3187 John 2491 the Baptist 910: but 1161 he that is least 3398 in 1722 the kingdom 932 of God 2316 is 2076 5748 greater than 3187 he 846. 

7:29 And 2532 all 3956 the people 2992 that heard 191 5660 [him], and 2532 the publicans 5057, justified 1344 5656 God 2316, being baptized 907 5685 with the baptism 908 of John 2491. 

7:30 But 1161 the Pharisees 5330 and 2532 lawyers 3544 rejected 114 5656 the counsel 1012 of God 2316 against 1519 themselves 1438, being 907 0 not 3361 baptized 907 5685 of 5259 him 846. 

7:31 And 1161 the Lord 2962 said 2036 5627, Whereunto 5101 then 3767 shall I liken 3666 5692 the men 444 of this 5026 generation 1074? and 2532 to what 5101 are they 1526 5748 like 3664? 

7:32 They are 1526 5748 like 3664 unto children 3813 sitting 2521 5740 in 1722 the marketplace 58, and 2532 calling 4377 5719 5723 one to another 240, and 2532 saying 3004 5719 5723, We have piped 832 5656 unto you 5213, and 2532 ye have 3738 0 not 3756 danced 3738 5662; we have mourned 2354 5656 to you 5213, and 2532 ye have 2799 0 not 3756 wept 2799 5656. 

7:33 For 1063 John 2491 the Baptist 910 came 2064 5754 neither 3383 eating 2068 5723 bread 740 nor 3383 drinking 4095 5723 wine 3631; and 2532 ye say 3004 5719, He hath 2192 5719 a devil 1140. 

7:34 The Son 5207 of man 444 is come 2064 5754 eating 2068 5723 and 2532 drinking 4095 5723; and 2532 ye say 3004 5719, Behold 2400 5628 a gluttonous 5314 man 444, and 2532 a winebibber 3630, a friend 5384 of publicans 5057 and 2532 sinners 268! 

7:35 But 2532 wisdom 4678 is justified 1344 5681 of 575 all 3956 her 848 children 5043. 

7:36 And 1161 one 5100 of the Pharisees 5330 desired 2065 5707 him 846 that 2443 he would eat 5315 5632 with 3326 him 846. And 2532 he went 1525 5631 into 1519 the Pharisee's 5330 house 3614, and sat down to meat 347 5681. 

7:37 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, a woman 1135 in 1722 the city 4172, which 3748 was 2258 5713 a sinner 268, when she knew 1921 5631 that 3754 [Jesus] sat at meat 345 5736 in 1722 the Pharisee's 5330 house 3614, brought 2865 5660 an alabaster box 211 of ointment 3464, 

7:38 And 2532 stood 2476 5631 at 3844 his 846 feet 4228 behind 3694 [him] weeping 2799 5723, and began 756 5662 to wash 1026 5721 his 846 feet 4228 with tears 1144, and 2532 did wipe 1591 5707 [them] with the hairs 2359 of her 848 head 2776, and 2532 kissed 2705 5707 his 846 feet 4228, and 2532 anointed 218 5707 [them] with the ointment 3464. 

7:39 Now 1161 when the Pharisee 5330 which 3588 had bidden 2564 5660 him 846 saw 1492 5631 [it], he spake 2036 5627 within 1722 himself 1438, saying 3004 5723, This man 3778, if 1487 he were 2258 5713 a prophet 4396, 302 would have known 1097 5707 who 5101 and 2532 what manner 4217 of woman 1135 [this is] that 3748 toucheth 680 5731 him 846: for 3754 she is 2076 5748 a sinner 268. 

7:40 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Simon 4613, I have 2192 5719 somewhat 5100 to say 2036 5629 unto thee 4671. And 1161 he saith 5346 5748, Master 1320, say on 2036 5628. 

7:41 There was 2258 5713 a certain 5100 creditor 1157 which had two 1417 debtors 5533: the one 1520 owed 3784 5707 five hundred 4001 pence 1220, and 1161 the other 2087 fifty 4004. 

7:42 And 1161 when they 846 had 2192 5723 nothing 3361 to pay 591 5629, he frankly forgave 5483 5662 them both 297. Tell me 2036 5628 therefore 3767, which 5101 of them 846 will love 25 5692 him 846 most 4119? 

7:43 Simon 4613 answered 611 5679 and 1161 said 2036 5627, I suppose 5274 5719 that 3754 [he], to whom 3739 he forgave 5483 5662 most 4119. And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Thou hast 2919 0 rightly 3723 judged 2919 5656. 

7:44 And 2532 he turned 4762 5651 to 4314 the woman 1135, and said 5346 5713 unto Simon 4613, Seest thou 991 5719 this 5026 woman 1135? I entered 1525 5627 into 1519 thine 4675 house 3614, thou gavest me 1325 5656 no 3756 water 5204 for 1909 my 3450 feet 4228: but 1161 she 3778 hath washed 1026 5656 my 3450 feet 4228 with tears 1144, and 2532 wiped 1591 5656 [them] with the hairs 2359 of her 848 head 2776. 

7:45 Thou gavest 1325 5656 me 3427 no 3756 kiss 5370: but 1161 this woman 3778 since 575 the time 3739 I came in 1525 5627 hath 1257 0 not 3756 ceased 1257 5627 to kiss 2705 5723 my 3450 feet 4228. 

7:46 My 3450 head 2776 with oil 1637 thou didst 218 0 not 3756 anoint 218 5656: but 1161 this woman 3778 hath anointed 218 5656 my 3450 feet 4228 with ointment 3464. 

7:47 Wherefore 3739 5484 I say 3004 5719 unto thee 4671, Her 846 sins 266, which 3588 are many 4183, are forgiven 863 5769; for 3754 she loved 25 5656 much 4183: but 1161 to whom 3739 little 3641 is forgiven 863 5743, [the same] loveth 25 5719 little 3641. 

7:48 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto her 846, Thy 4675 sins 266 are forgiven 863 5769. 

7:49 And 2532 they that sat at meat with him 4873 5740 began 756 5662 to say 3004 5721 within 1722 themselves 1438, Who 5101 is 2076 5748 this 3778 that 3739 forgiveth 863 5719 sins 266 also 2532? 

7:50 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 to 4314 the woman 1135, Thy 4675 faith 4102 hath saved 4982 5758 thee 4571; go 4198 5737 in 1519 peace 1515. 

8:1 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633 afterward 1722 2517, that 2532 he went 1353 5707 throughout every 2596 city 4172 and 2532 village 2968, preaching 2784 5723 and 2532 shewing the glad tidings 2097 5734 of the kingdom 932 of God 2316: and 2532 the twelve 1427 [were] with 4862 him 846, 

8:2 And 2532 certain 5100 women 1135, which 3739 had been 2258 5713 healed 2323 5772 of 575 evil 4190 spirits 4151 and 2532 infirmities 769, Mary 3137 called 2564 5746 Magdalene 3094, out of 575 whom 3739 went 1831 5715 seven 2033 devils 1140, 

8:3 And 2532 Joanna 2489 the wife 1135 of Chuza 5529 Herod's 2264 steward 2012, and 2532 Susanna 4677, and 2532 many 4183 others 2087, which 3748 ministered 1247 5707 unto him 846 of 575 their 846 substance 5224 5723. 

8:4 And 1161 when much 4183 people 3793 were gathered together 4896 5752, and 2532 were come 1975 5740 to 4314 him 846 out of every 2596 city 4172, he spake 2036 5627 by 1223 a parable 3850: 

8:5 A sower 4687 5723 went out 1831 5627 to sow 4687 5658 his 848 seed 4703: and 2532 as 1722 he 846 sowed 4687 5721, some 3739 3303 fell 4098 5627 by 3844 the way side 3598; and 2532 it was trodden down 2662 5681, and 2532 the fowls 4071 of the air 3772 devoured 2719 5627 it 846. 

8:6 And 2532 some 2087 fell 4098 5627 upon 1909 a rock 4073; and 2532 as soon as it was sprung up 5453 5651, it withered away 3583 5681, because 1223 it lacked 3361 2192 5721 moisture 2429. 

8:7 And 2532 some 2087 fell 4098 5627 among 1722 3319 thorns 173; and 2532 the thorns 173 sprang up with it 4855 5651, and choked 638 5656 5625 1970 5656 it 846. 

8:8 And 2532 other 2087 fell 4098 5627 on 1909 good 18 ground 1093, and 2532 sprang up 5453 5651, and bare 4160 5656 fruit 2590 an hundredfold 1542. And when he had said 3004 5723 these things 5023, he cried 5455 5707, He that hath 2192 5723 ears 3775 to hear 191 5721, let him hear 191 5720. 

8:9 And 1161 his 846 disciples 3101 asked 1905 5707 him 846, saying 3004 5723, What 5101 might 1498 0 this 3778 parable 3850 be 1498 5751? 

8:10 And 1161 he said 2036 5627, Unto you 5213 it is given 1325 5769 to know 1097 5629 the mysteries 3466 of the kingdom 932 of God 2316: but 1161 to others 3062 in 1722 parables 3850; that 2443 seeing 991 5723 they might 991 0 not 3361 see 991 5725, and 2532 hearing 191 5723 they might 4920 0 not 3361 understand 4920 5725. 

8:11 Now 1161 the parable 3850 is 2076 5748 this 3778: The seed 4703 is 2076 5748 the word 3056 of God 2316. 

8:12 Those 1161 by 3844 the way side 3598 are 1526 5748 they that hear 191 5723; then 1534 cometh 2064 5736 the devil 1228, and 2532 taketh away 142 5719 the word 3056 out of 575 their 846 hearts 2588, lest 3363 they should believe 4100 5660 and be saved 4982 5686. 

8:13 1161 They on 1909 the rock 4073 [are they], which 3739, when 3752 they hear 191 5661, receive 1209 5736 the word 3056 with 3326 joy 5479; and 2532 these 3778 have 2192 5719 no 3756 root 4491, which 3739 for 4314 a while 2540 believe 4100 5719, and 2532 in 1722 time 2540 of temptation 3986 fall away 868 5736. 

8:14 And 1161 that which fell 4098 5631 among 1519 thorns 173 are 1526 5748 they 3778, which, when they have heard 191 5660, go forth 4198 5740, and 2532 are choked 4846 5743 with 5259 cares 3308 and 2532 riches 4149 and 2532 pleasures 2237 of [this] life 979, and 2532 bring 5052 0 no 3756 fruit to perfection 5052 5719. 

8:15 But 1161 that on 1722 the good 2570 ground 1093 are 1526 5748 they 3778, which 3748 in 1722 an honest 2570 and 2532 good 18 heart 2588, having heard 191 5660 the word 3056, keep 2722 5719 [it], and 2532 bring forth fruit 2592 5719 with 1722 patience 5281. 

8:16 1161 No man 3762, when he hath lighted 681 5660 a candle 3088, covereth 2572 5719 it 846 with a vessel 4632, or 2228 putteth 5087 5719 [it] under 5270 a bed 2825; but 235 setteth 2007 5719 [it] on 1909 a candlestick 3087, that 2443 they which enter in 1531 5740 may see 991 5725 the light 5457. 

8:17 For 1063 nothing 3756 is 2076 5748 secret 2927, that 3739 shall 1096 0 not 3756 be made 1096 5695 manifest 5318; neither 3761 [any thing] hid 614, that 3739 shall 1097 0 not 3756 be known 1097 5701 and 2532 come 2064 5632 abroad 1519 5318. 

8:18 Take heed 991 5720 therefore 3767 how 4459 ye hear 191 5719: for 1063 whosoever 3739 302 hath 2192 5725, to him 846 shall be given 1325 5701; and 2532 whosoever 3739 302 hath 2192 5725 not 3361, from 575 him 846 shall be taken 142 5701 even 2532 that which 3739 he seemeth 1380 5719 to have 2192 5721. 

8:19 Then 1161 came 3854 5633 to 4314 him 846 [his] mother 3384 and 2532 his 846 brethren 80, and 2532 could 1410 5711 not 3756 come 4940 5629 at him 846 for 1223 the press 3793. 

8:20 And 2532 it was told 518 5648 him 846 [by certain] which said 3004 5723, Thy 4675 mother 3384 and 2532 thy 4675 brethren 80 stand 2476 5758 without 1854, desiring 2309 5723 to see 1492 5629 thee 4571. 

8:21 And 1161 he answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, My 3450 mother 3384 and 2532 my 3450 brethren 80 are 1526 5748 these 3778 which 3588 hear 191 5723 the word 3056 of God 2316, and 2532 do 4160 5723 it 846. 

8:22 Now 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633 on 1722 a certain 3391 day 2250, that 2532 he went 1684 5627 into 1519 a ship 4143 with 2532 his 846 disciples 3101: and 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Let us go over 1330 5632 unto 1519 the other side 4008 of the lake 3041. And 2532 they launched forth 321 5681. 

8:23 But 1161 as they sailed 4126 5723 he fell asleep 879 5656: and 2532 there came down 2597 5627 a storm 2978 of wind 417 on 1519 the lake 3041; and 2532 they were filled 4845 5712 [with water], and 2532 were in jeopardy 2793 5707. 

8:24 And 1161 they came to him 4334 5631, and awoke 1326 5656 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Master 1988, master 1988, we perish 622 5731. Then 1161 he arose 1453 5685, and rebuked 2008 5656 the wind 417 and 2532 the raging 2830 of the water 5204: and 2532 they ceased 3973 5668, and 2532 there was 1096 5633 a calm 1055. 

8:25 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Where 4226 is 2076 5748 your 5216 faith 4102? And 1161 they being afraid 5399 5679 wondered 2296 5656, saying 3004 5723 one to another 4314 240, What manner of man 5101 686 is 2076 5748 this 3778! for 3754 he commandeth 2004 5719 even 2532 the winds 417 and 2532 water 5204, and 2532 they obey 5219 5719 him 846. 

8:26 And 2532 they arrived 2668 5656 at 1519 the country 5561 of the Gadarenes 1046, which 3748 is 2076 5748 over against 495 Galilee 1056. 

8:27 And 1161 when he went forth 1831 5631 to 1909 land 1093, there met 5221 5656 him 846 out of 1537 the city 4172 a certain 5100 man 435, which 3739 had 2192 5707 devils 1140 long 1537 2425 time 5550, and 2532 ware 1737 5710 no 3756 clothes 2440, neither 2532 3756 abode 3306 5707 in 1722 [any] house 3614, but 235 in 1722 the tombs 3418. 

8:28 When 1161 he saw 1492 5631 Jesus 2424, he cried out 349 5660, and 2532 fell down before 4363 5627 him 846, and 2532 with a loud 3173 voice 5456 said 2036 5627, What 5101 have I 1698 to do with 2532 thee 4671, Jesus 2424, [thou] Son 5207 of God 2316 most high 5310? I beseech 1189 5736 thee 4675, torment 928 5661 me 3165 not 3361. 

8:29 (For 1063 he had commanded 3853 5707 5625 3853 5656 the unclean 169 spirit 4151 to come 1831 5629 out of 575 the man 444. For 1063 oftentimes 4183 5550 it had caught 4884 5715 him 846: and 2532 he was kept 5442 5746 bound 1196 5712 with chains 254 and 2532 in fetters 3976; and 2532 he brake 1284 5723 the bands 1199, and was driven 1643 5712 of 5259 the devil 1142 into 1519 the wilderness 2048) 

8:30 And 1161 Jesus 2424 asked 1905 5656 him 846, saying 3004 5723, What 5101 is 2076 5748 thy 4671 name 3686? And 1161 he said 2036 5627, Legion 3003: because 3754 many 4183 devils 1140 were entered 1525 5627 into 1519 him 846. 

8:31 And 2532 they besought 3870 5707 5625 3870 5707 him 846 that 3363 0 he would 2004 0 not 3363 command 2004 5661 them 846 to go out 565 5629 into 1519 the deep 12. 

8:32 And 1161 there was 2258 5713 there 1563 an herd 34 of many 2425 swine 5519 feeding 1006 5746 on 1722 the mountain 3735: and 2532 they besought 3870 5707 him 846 that 2443 he would suffer 2010 5661 them 846 to enter 1525 5629 into 1519 them 1565 846. And 2532 he suffered 2010 5656 them 846. 

8:33 Then 1161 went 1831 5631 the devils 1140 out of 575 the man 444, and entered 1525 5627 into 1519 the swine 5519: and 2532 the herd 34 ran 3729 5656 violently down 2596 a steep 2911 place into 1519 the lake 3041, and 2532 were choked 638 5648. 

8:34 When 1161 they that fed 1006 5723 [them] saw 1492 5631 what was done 1096 5772, they fled 5343 5627, and 2532 went 565 5631 and told 518 5656 [it] in 1519 the city 4172 and 2532 in 1519 the country 68. 

8:35 Then 1161 they went out 1831 5627 to see 1492 5629 what was done 1096 5756; and 2532 came 2064 5627 to 4314 Jesus 2424, and 2532 found 2147 5627 the man 444, out of 575 whom 3739 the devils 1140 were departed 1831 5715, sitting 2521 5740 at 3844 the feet 4228 of Jesus 2424, clothed 2439 5772, and 2532 in his right mind 4993 5723: and 2532 they were afraid 5399 5675. 

8:36 1161 They also 2532 which saw 1492 5631 [it] told 518 5656 them 846 by what means 4459 he that was possessed of the devils 1139 5679 was healed 4982 5681. 

8:37 Then 2532 the whole 537 multitude 4128 of the country 4066 0 of the Gadarenes 1046 round about 4066 besought 2065 5656 him 846 to depart 565 5629 from 575 them 846; for 3754 they were taken 4912 5712 with great 3173 fear 5401: and 1161 he went up 1684 5631 into 1519 the ship 4143, and returned back again 5290 5656. 

8:38 Now 1161 the man 435 out of 575 whom 3739 the devils 1140 were departed 1831 5715 besought 1189 5711 him that he might be 1511 5750 with 4862 him 846: but 1161 Jesus 2424 sent 630 0 him 846 away 630 5656, saying 3004 5723, 

8:39 Return 5290 5720 to 1519 thine own 4675 house 3624, and 2532 shew 1334 5737 how great things 3745 God 2316 hath done 4160 5656 unto thee 4671. And 2532 he went his way 565 5627, and published 2784 5723 throughout 2596 the whole 3650 city 4172 how great things 3745 Jesus 2424 had done 4160 5656 unto him 846. 

8:40 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, that, when 1722 Jesus 2424 was returned 5290 5658, the people 3793 [gladly] received 588 5662 him 846: for 1063 they were 2258 5713 all 3956 waiting for 4328 5723 him 846. 

8:41 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, there came 2064 5627 a man 435 named 3739 3686 Jairus 2383, and 2532 he 846 was 5225 5707 a ruler 758 of the synagogue 4864: and 2532 he fell down 4098 5631 at 3844 Jesus 2424' feet 4228, and besought 3870 5707 him 846 that he would come 1525 5629 into 1519 his 848 house 3624: 

8:42 For 3754 he had 2258 5713 one only 3439 daughter 2364, about 5613 twelve 1427 years of age 2094, and 2532 she 3778 lay a dying 599 5707. But 1161 as 1722 he 846 went 5217 5721 the people 3793 thronged 4846 5707 him 846. 

8:43 And 2532 a woman 1135 having 5607 5752 1722 an issue 4511 of blood 129 twelve 1427 years 575 2094, which 3748 had spent 4321 5660 all 3650 her living 979 upon 1519 physicians 2395, neither 3756 could 2480 5656 be healed 2323 5683 of 5259 any 3762, 

8:44 Came 4334 5631 behind 3693 [him], and touched 680 5662 the border 2899 of his 846 garment 2440: and 2532 immediately 3916 her 846 issue 4511 of blood 129 stanched 2476 5627. 

8:45 And 2532 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627, Who 5101 touched 680 5671 me 3450? When 1161 all 3956 denied 720 5740, Peter 4074 and 2532 they that were with 3326 him 846 said 2036 5627, Master 1988, the multitude 3793 throng 4912 5719 thee 4571 and 2532 press 598 5719 [thee], and 2532 sayest 3004 5719 thou, Who 5101 touched 680 5671 me 3450? 

8:46 And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627, Somebody 5100 hath touched 680 5662 me 3450: for 1063 I 1473 perceive 1097 5627 that virtue 1411 is gone 1831 5631 out of 575 me 1700. 

8:47 And 1161 when the woman 1135 saw 1492 5631 that 3754 she was 2990 0 not 3756 hid 2990 5627, she came 2064 5627 trembling 5141 5723, and 2532 falling down before 4363 5631 him 846, she declared 518 5656 unto him 846 before 1799 all 3956 the people 2992 for 1223 what 3739 cause 156 she had touched 680 5662 him 846, and 2532 how 5613 she was healed 2390 5681 immediately 3916. 

8:48 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto her 846, Daughter 2364, be of good comfort 2293 5720: thy 4675 faith 4102 hath made 4982 0 thee 4571 whole 4982 5758; go 4198 5737 in 1519 peace 1515. 

8:49 While he 846 yet 2089 spake 2980 5723, there cometh 2064 5736 one 5100 from 3844 the ruler of the synagogue's 752 [house], saying 3004 5723 to him 846, 3754 Thy 4675 daughter 2364 is dead 2348 5758; trouble 4660 5720 not 3361 the Master 1320. 

8:50 But 1161 when Jesus 2424 heard 191 5660 [it], he answered 611 5662 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Fear 5399 5732 5737 not 3361: believe 4100 5720 only 3440, and 2532 she shall be made whole 4982 5701. 

8:51 And 1161 when he came 1525 5631 into 1519 the house 3614, he suffered 863 5656 no 3756 man 3762 to go in 1525 5629, save 1508 Peter 4074, and 2532 James 2385, and 2532 John 2491, and 2532 the father 3962 and 2532 the mother 3384 of the maiden 3816. 

8:52 And 1161 all 3956 wept 2799 5707, and 2532 bewailed 2875 5710 her 846: but 1161 he said 2036 5627, Weep 2799 5720 not 3361; she is 599 0 not 3756 dead 599 5627, but 235 sleepeth 2518 5719. 

8:53 And 2532 they laughed 2606 0 him 846 to scorn 2606 5707, knowing 1492 5761 that 3754 she was dead 599 5627. 

8:54 And 1161 he put 1544 5631 them all 3956 out 1854, and 2532 took 2902 5660 her 846 by the hand 5495, and called 5455 5656, saying 3004 5723, Maid 3816, arise 1453 5728. 

8:55 And 2532 her 846 spirit 4151 came again 1994 5656, and 2532 she arose 450 5627 straightway 3916: and 2532 he commanded 1299 5656 to give 1325 5683 her 846 meat 5315 5629. 

8:56 And 2532 her 846 parents 1118 were astonished 1839 5627: but 1161 he charged 3853 5656 them 846 that they should tell 2036 5629 no man 3367 what was done 1096 5756. 

9:1 Then 1161 he called 4779 0 his 848 twelve 1427 disciples 3101 together 4779 5671, and 2532 gave 1325 5656 them 846 power 1411 and authority 1849 over 1909 all 3956 devils 1140, and 2532 to cure 2323 5721 diseases 3554. 

9:2 And 2532 he sent 649 5656 them 846 to preach 2784 5721 the kingdom 932 of God 2316, and 2532 to heal 2390 5738 the sick 770 5723. 

9:3 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Take 142 5720 nothing 3367 for 1519 [your] journey 3598, neither 3383 staves 4464, nor 3383 scrip 4082, neither 3383 bread 740, neither 3383 money 694; neither 3383 have 2192 5721 two 1417 coats 5509 apiece 303. 

9:4 And 2532 whatsoever 3739 302 house 3614 ye enter 1525 5632 into 1519, there 1563 abide 3306 5720, and 2532 thence 1564 depart 1831 5737. 

9:5 And 2532 whosoever 3745 3739 302 will 1209 0 not 3361 receive 1209 5667 you 5209, when ye go 1831 5740 out of 575 that 1565 city 4172, shake off 660 5657 the very 2532 dust 2868 from 575 your 5216 feet 4228 for 1519 a testimony 3142 against 1909 them 846. 

9:6 And 1161 they departed 1831 5740, and went 1330 5711 through 2596 the towns 2968, preaching the gospel 2097 5734, and 2532 healing 2323 5723 every where 3837. 

9:7 Now 1161 Herod 2264 the tetrarch 5076 heard 191 5656 of all 3956 that was done 1096 5740 by 5259 him 846: and 2532 he was perplexed 1280 5707, because 1223 that it was said 3004 5745 of 5259 some 5100, that 3754 John 2491 was risen 1453 5769 from 1537 the dead 3498; 

9:8 And 1161 of 5259 some 5100, that 3754 Elias 2243 had appeared 5316 5648; and 1161 of others 243, that 3754 one 1520 of the old 744 prophets 4396 was risen again 450 5627. 

9:9 And 2532 Herod 2264 said 2036 5627, John 2491 have 607 0 I 1473 beheaded 607 5656: but 1161 who 5101 is 2076 5748 this 3778, of 4012 whom 3739 I 1473 hear 191 5719 such things 5108? And 2532 he desired 2212 5707 to see 1492 5629 him 846. 

9:10 And 2532 the apostles 652, when they were returned 5290 5660, told 1334 5662 him 846 all that 3745 they had done 4160 5656. And 2532 he took 3880 5631 them 846, and went aside 5298 5656 privately 2596 2398 into 1519 a desert 2048 place 5117 belonging to the city 4172 called 2564 5746 Bethsaida 966. 

9:11 And 1161 the people 3793, when they knew 1097 5631 [it], followed 190 5656 him 846: and 2532 he received 1209 5666 them 846, and spake 2980 5707 unto them 846 of 4012 the kingdom 932 of God 2316, and 2532 healed 2390 5711 them 846 that had 2192 5723 need 5532 of healing 2322. 

9:12 And 1161 when the day 2250 began 756 5662 to wear away 2827 5721, then 1161 came 4334 5631 the twelve 1427, and said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Send 630 0 the multitude 3793 away 630 5657, that 2443 they may go 565 5631 into 1519 the towns 2968 and 2532 country 68 round about 2945, and lodge 2647 5661, and 2532 get 2147 5627 victuals 1979: for 3754 we are 2070 5748 here 5602 in 1722 a desert 2048 place 5117. 

9:13 But 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Give 1325 5628 ye 5210 them 846 to eat 5315 5629. And 1161 they said 2036 5627, We 2254 have no 3756 1526 5748 more 4119 but 2228 five 4002 loaves 740 and 2532 two 1417 fishes 2486; except 1509 we 2249 should go 4198 5679 and buy 59 5661 meat 1033 for 1519 all 3956 this 5126 people 2992. 

9:14 For 1063 they were 2258 5713 about 5616 five thousand 4000 men 435. And 1161 he said 2036 5627 to 4314 his 848 disciples 3101, Make 2625 0 them 846 sit down 2625 5657 by 303 fifties 4004 in a company 2828. 

9:15 And 2532 they did 4160 5656 so 3779, and 2532 made 347 0 them 846 all 537 sit down 347 5656. 

9:16 Then 1161 he took 2983 5631 the five 4002 loaves 740 and 2532 the two 1417 fishes 2486, and looking up 308 5660 to 1519 heaven 3772, he blessed 2127 5656 them 846, and 2532 brake 2622 5656, and 2532 gave 1325 5707 to the disciples 3101 to set before 3908 5683 the multitude 3793. 

9:17 And 2532 they did eat 5315 5627, and 2532 were 5526 0 all 3956 filled 5526 5681: and 2532 there was taken up 142 5681 of fragments 2801 that remained 4052 5660 to them 846 twelve 1427 baskets 2894. 

9:18 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, as 1722 he was 1511 5750 alone 2651 praying 4336 5740, his 846 disciples 3101 were with 4895 5713 him 846: and 2532 he asked 1905 5656 them 846, saying 3004 5723, Whom 5101 say 3004 5719 the people 3793 that I 3165 am 1511 5750? 

9:19 They 1161 answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627, John 2491 the Baptist 910; but 1161 some 243 [say], Elias 2243; and 1161 others 243 [say], that 3754 one 5100 of the old 744 prophets 4396 is risen again 450 5627. 

9:20 1161 He said 2036 5627 unto them 846, But 1161 whom 5101 say 3004 5719 ye 5210 that I 3165 am 1511 5750? 1161 Peter 4074 answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627, The Christ 5547 of God 2316. 

9:21 And 1161 he straitly charged 2008 5660 them 846, and commanded 3853 5656 [them] to tell 2036 5629 no man 3367 that thing 5124; 

9:22 Saying 2036 5631, 3754 The Son 5207 of man 444 must 1163 5748 suffer 3958 5629 many things 4183, and 2532 be rejected 593 5683 of 575 the elders 4245 and 2532 chief priests 749 and 2532 scribes 1122, and 2532 be slain 615 5683, and 2532 be raised 1453 5683 the third 5154 day 2250. 

9:23 And 1161 he said 3004 5707 to 4314 [them] all 3956, If any [man] 1536 will 2309 5719 come 2064 5629 after 3694 me 3450, let him deny 533 5663 himself 1438, and 2532 take up 142 5657 his 848 cross 4716 daily 2250 2596, and 2532 follow 190 5720 me 3427. 

9:24 For 1063 whosoever 3739 302 will 2309 5725 save 4982 5658 his 848 life 5590 shall lose 622 5692 it 846: but 1161 whosoever 3739 302 will lose 622 5661 his 848 life 5590 for my 1700 sake 1752, the same 3778 shall save 4982 5692 it 846. 

9:25 For 1063 what 5101 is 5623 0 a man 444 advantaged 5623 5743, if he gain 2770 5660 the whole 3650 world 2889, and 1161 lose 622 5660 himself 1438, or 2228 be cast away 2210 5685? 

9:26 For 1063 whosoever 3739 302 shall be ashamed 1870 5680 of me 3165 and 2532 of my 1699 words 3056, of him 5126 shall 1870 0 the Son 5207 of man 444 be ashamed 1870 5700, when 3752 he shall come 2064 5632 in 1722 his own 848 glory 1391, and 2532 [in his] Father's 3962, and 2532 of the holy 40 angels 32. 

9:27 But 1161 I tell 3004 5719 you 5213 of a truth 230, there be 1526 5748 some 5100 standing 2476 5761 here 5602, which 3739 shall 1089 0 not 3364 taste 1089 5695 of death 2288, till 2193 302 they see 1492 5632 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. 

9:28 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633 about 5616 an eight 3638 days 2250 after 3326 these 5128 sayings 3056, 2532 he took 3880 5631 Peter 4074 and 2532 John 2491 and 2532 James 2385, and went up 305 5627 into 1519 a mountain 3735 to pray 4336 5664. 

9:29 And 2532 as 1722 he prayed 4336 5738, the fashion 1491 of his 846 countenance 4383 was 1096 5633 altered 2087, and 2532 his 846 raiment 2441 [was] white 3022 [and] glistering 1823 5723. 

9:30 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, there talked 4814 5707 with him 846 two 1417 men 435, which 3748 were 2258 5713 Moses 3475 and 2532 Elias 2243: 

9:31 Who 3739 appeared 3700 5685 in 1722 glory 1391, and spake 3004 5707 of his 846 decease 1841 which 3739 he should 3195 5707 accomplish 4137 5721 at 1722 Jerusalem 2419. 

9:32 But 1161 Peter 4074 and 2532 they that were with 4862 him 846 were 2258 5713 heavy 916 5772 with sleep 5258: and 1161 when they were awake 1235 5660, they saw 1492 5627 his 846 glory 1391, and 2532 the two 1417 men 435 that stood with 4921 5761 him 846. 

9:33 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, as 1722 they 846 departed 1316 5738 from 575 him 846, Peter 4074 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 Jesus 2424, Master 1988, it is 2076 5748 good 2570 for us 2248 to be 1511 5750 here 5602: and 2532 let us make 4160 5661 three 5140 tabernacles 4633; one for 3391 thee 4671, and 2532 one for 3391 Moses 3475, and 2532 one for 3391 Elias 2243: not 3361 knowing 1492 5761 what 3739 he said 3004 5719. 

9:34 While 1161 he 846 thus 5023 spake 3004 5723, there came 1096 5633 a cloud 3507, and 2532 overshadowed 1982 5656 them 846: and 1161 they feared 5399 5675 as 1722 they 1565 entered 1525 5629 into 1519 the cloud 3507. 

9:35 And 2532 there came 1096 5633 a voice 5456 out of 1537 the cloud 3507, saying 3004 5723, This 3778 is 2076 5748 my 3450 beloved 27 Son 5207: hear 191 5720 him 846. 

9:36 And 2532 when the voice 5456 was past 1722 1096 5635, Jesus 2424 was found 2147 5681 alone 3441. And 2532 they 846 kept [it] close 4601 5656, and 2532 told 518 5656 no man 3762 in 1722 those 1565 days 2250 any 3762 of those things which 3739 they had seen 3708 5758. 

9:37 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, that on 1722 the next 1836 day 2250, when they 846 were come down 2718 5631 from 575 the hill 3735, much 4183 people 3793 met 4876 5656 him 846. 

9:38 And, 2532 behold 2400 5628, a man 435 of 575 the company 3793 cried out 310 5656, saying 3004 5723, Master 1320, I beseech 1189 5736 thee 4675, look 1914 5657 upon 1909 my 3450 son 5207: for 3754 he is 2076 5748 mine 3427 only child 3439. 

9:39 And 2532, lo 2400 5628, a spirit 4151 taketh 2983 5719 him 846, and 2532 he suddenly 1810 crieth out 2896 5719; and 2532 it teareth 4682 5719 him 846 that he foameth 876 again 3326, and 2532 bruising 4937 5723 him 846 hardly 3425 departeth 672 5719 from 575 him 846. 

9:40 And 2532 I besought 1189 5681 thy 4675 disciples 3101 to 2443 cast 1544 0 him 846 out 1544 5725; and 2532 they could 1410 5675 not 3756. 

9:41 And 1161 Jesus 2424 answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627, O 5599 faithless 571 and 2532 perverse 1294 5772 generation 1074, how 2193 long 4219 shall I be 2071 5704 with 4314 you 5209, and 2532 suffer 430 5695 you 5216? Bring 4317 5628 thy 4675 son 5207 hither 5602. 

9:42 And 1161 as he was 4334 0 yet 2089 a coming 4334 5740, the devil 1140 threw 4486 0 him 846 down 4486 5656, and 2532 tare 4952 5656 [him]. And 1161 Jesus 2424 rebuked 2008 5656 the unclean 169 spirit 4151, and 2532 healed 2390 5662 the child 3816, and 2532 delivered 591 0 him 846 again 591 5656 to his 846 father 3962. 

9:43 And 1161 they were 1605 0 all 3956 amazed 1605 5712 at 1909 the mighty power 3168 of God 2316. But 1161 while they wondered 2296 5723 every one 3956 at 1909 all things 3956 which 3739 Jesus 2424 did 4160 5656, he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 his 848 disciples 3101, 

9:44 Let these 5128 sayings 3056 sink down 5087 5640 into 1519 your 5210 5216 ears 3775: for 1063 the Son 5207 of man 444 shall be 3195 5719 delivered 3860 5745 into 1519 the hands 5495 of men 444. 

9:45 But 1161 they understood not 50 5707 this 5124 saying 4487, and 2532 it was 2258 5713 hid 3871 5772 from 575 them 846, that 3363 0 they perceived 143 5638 it 846 not 3363: and 2532 they feared 5399 5711 to ask 2065 5658 him 846 of 4012 that 5127 saying 4487. 

9:46 Then 1161 there arose 1525 5627 a reasoning 1261 among 1722 them 846, which 5101 302 of them 846 should be 1498 5751 greatest 3187. 

9:47 And 1161 Jesus 2424, perceiving 1492 5631 the thought 1261 of their 846 heart 2588, took 1949 5637 a child 3813, and set 2476 5656 him 846 by 3844 him 1438, 

9:48 And 2532 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Whosoever 3739 1437 shall receive 1209 5667 this 5124 child 3813 in 1909 my 3450 name 3686 receiveth 1209 5736 me 1691: and 2532 whosoever 3739 1437 shall receive 1209 5667 me 1691 receiveth him 1209 5736 that sent 649 5660 me 3165: for 1063 he that is 5225 5723 least 3398 among 1722 you 5213 all 3956, the same 3778 shall be 2071 5704 great 3173. 

9:49 And 1161 John 2491 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, Master 1988, we saw 1492 5627 one 5100 casting out 1544 5723 devils 1140 in 1909 thy 4675 name 3686; and 2532 we forbad 2967 5656 him 846, because 3754 he followeth 190 5719 not 3756 with 3326 us 2257. 

9:50 And 2532 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Forbid 2967 5720 [him] not 3361: for 1063 he 3739 that is 2076 5748 not 3756 against 2596 us 2257 is 2076 5748 for 5228 us 2257. 

9:51 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, when 1722 the time 2250 was come 4845 5745 that he 846 should be received up 354, 2532 he stedfastly set 4741 5656 his 848 face 4383 to go 4198 5738 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419, 

9:52 And 2532 sent 649 5656 messengers 32 before 4253 his 848 face 4383: and 2532 they went 4198 5679, and entered 1525 5627 into 1519 a village 2968 of the Samaritans 4541, to 5620 make ready 2090 5658 for him 846. 

9:53 And 2532 they did 1209 0 not 3756 receive 1209 5662 him 846, because 3754 his 846 face 4383 was 2258 5713 as though he would go 4198 5740 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419. 

9:54 And 1161 when his 846 disciples 3101 James 2385 and 2532 John 2491 saw 1492 5631 [this], they said 2036 5627, Lord 2962, wilt thou 2309 5719 that we command 2036 5632 fire 4442 to come down 2597 5629 from 575 heaven 3772, and 2532 consume 355 5658 them 846, even 2532 as 5613 Elias 2243 did 4160 5656? 

9:55 But 1161 he turned 4762 5651, and rebuked 2008 5656 them 846, and 2532 said 2036 5627, Ye know 1492 5758 not 3756 what manner 3634 of spirit 4151 ye 5210 are of 2075 5748. 

9:56 For 1063 the Son 5207 of man 444 is 2064 0 not 3756 come 2064 5627 to destroy 622 5658 men's 444 lives 5590, but 235 to save 4982 5658 [them]. And 2532 they went 4198 5675 to 1519 another 2087 village 2968. 

9:57 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, that, as they went 4198 5740 in 1722 the way 3598, a certain 5100 [man] said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Lord 2962, I will follow 190 5692 thee 4671 whithersoever 3699 302 thou goest 565 5741. 

9:58 And 2532 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Foxes 258 have 2192 5719 holes 5454, and 2532 birds 4071 of the air 3772 [have] nests 2682; but 1161 the Son 5207 of man 444 hath 2192 5719 not 3756 where 4226 to lay 2827 5725 [his] head 2776. 

9:59 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 another 2087, Follow 190 5720 me 3427. But 1161 he said 2036 5627, Lord 2962, suffer 2010 5657 me 3427 first 4412 to go 565 5631 and bury 2290 5658 my 3450 father 3962. 

9:60 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Let 863 5628 the dead 3498 bury 2290 5658 their 1438 dead 3498: but 1161 go 565 5631 thou 4771 and preach 1229 5720 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. 

9:61 And 1161 another 2087 also 2532 said 2036 5627, Lord 2962, I will follow 190 5692 thee 4671; but 1161 let 2010 5657 me 3427 first 4412 go bid them farewell 657 5670, which are at home at 1519 my 3450 house 3624. 

9:62 And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, No man 3762, having put 1911 5631 his 848 hand 5495 to 1909 the plough 723, and 2532 looking 991 5723 back 1519 3694, is 2076 5748 fit 2111 for 1519 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. 

10:1 1161 After 3326 these things 5023 the Lord 2962 appointed 322 5656 other 2087 seventy 1440 also 2532, and 2532 sent 649 5656 them 846 two 303 and two 1417 before 4253 his 848 face 4383 into 1519 every 3956 city 4172 and 2532 place 5117, whither 3757 he himself 846 would 3195 5707 come 2064 5738. 

10:2 Therefore 3767 said he 3004 5707 unto 4314 them 846, The harvest 2326 truly 3303 [is] great 4183, but 1161 the labourers 2040 [are] few 3641: pray ye 1189 5676 therefore 3767 the Lord 2962 of the harvest 2326, that 3704 he would send forth 1544 5725 labourers 2040 into 1519 his 848 harvest 2326. 

10:3 Go your ways 5217 5720: behold 2400 5628, I 1473 send 649 0 you 5209 forth 649 5719 as 5613 lambs 704 among 1722 3319 wolves 3074. 

10:4 Carry 941 5720 neither 3361 purse 905, nor 3361 scrip 4082, nor 3366 shoes 5266: and 2532 salute 782 5667 no man 3367 by 2596 the way 3598. 

10:5 And 1161 into 1519 whatsoever 3739 302 house 3614 ye enter 1525 5741, first 4412 say 3004 5720, Peace 1515 [be] to this 5129 house 3624. 

10:6 And 2532 if 1437 3303 the son 5207 of peace 1515 be 5600 5753 there 1563, your 5216 peace 1515 shall rest 1879 5695 upon 1909 it 846: if not 1490, it shall turn 344 0 to 1909 you 5209 again 344 5692. 

10:7 And 1161 in 1722 the same 846 house 3614 remain 3306 5720, eating 2068 5723 and 2532 drinking 4095 5723 such things as 3844 0 they 846 give 3844: for 1063 the labourer 2040 is 2076 5748 worthy 514 of his 848 hire 3408. Go 3327 5720 not 3361 from 1537 house 3614 to 1519 house 3614. 

10:8 And 2532 into 1519 whatsoever 1161 3739 302 city 4172 ye enter 1525 5741, and 2532 they receive 1209 5741 you 5209, eat such things 2068 5720 as are set before 3908 5746 you 5213: 

10:9 And 2532 heal 2323 5720 the sick 772 that are therein 1722 846, and 2532 say 3004 5720 unto them 846, The kingdom 932 of God 2316 is come nigh 1448 5758 unto 1909 you 5209. 

10:10 But 1161 into 1519 whatsoever 3739 302 city 4172 ye enter 1525 5741, and 2532 they receive 1209 5741 you 5209 not 3361, go your ways out 1831 5631 into 1519 the streets 4113 of the same 846, and say 2036 5628, 

10:11 Even 2532 the very dust 2868 of 1537 your 5216 city 4172, which 3588 cleaveth 2853 5685 on us 2254, we do wipe off 631 5731 against you 5213: notwithstanding 4133 be ye sure 1097 5720 of this 5124, that 3754 the kingdom 932 of God 2316 is come nigh 1448 5758 unto 1909 you 5209. 

10:12 But 1161 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, that 3754 it shall be 2071 5704 more tolerable 414 in 1722 that 1565 day 2250 for Sodom 4670, than 2228 for that 1565 city 4172. 

10:13 Woe 3759 unto thee 4671, Chorazin 5523! woe 3759 unto thee 4671, Bethsaida 966! for 3754 if 1487 the mighty works 1411 had been done 1096 5633 in 1722 Tyre 5184 and 2532 Sidon 4605, which 3588 have been done 1096 5637 in 1722 you 5213, they had 3340 0 a great while ago 3819 repented 3340 5656, sitting 2521 5740 in 302 1722 sackcloth 4526 and 2532 ashes 4700. 

10:14 But 4133 it shall be 2071 5704 more tolerable 414 for Tyre 5184 and 2532 Sidon 4605 at 1722 the judgment 2920, than 2228 for you 5213. 

10:15 And 2532 thou 4771, Capernaum 2584, which 3588 art exalted 5312 5685 to 2193 heaven 3772, shalt be thrust down 2601 5701 to 2193 hell 86. 

10:16 He that heareth 191 5723 you 5216 heareth 191 5719 me 1700; and 2532 he that despiseth 114 5723 you 5209 despiseth 114 5719 me 1691; and 1161 he that despiseth 114 5723 me 1691 despiseth 114 5719 him that sent 649 5660 me 3165. 

10:17 And 1161 the seventy 1440 returned again 5290 5656 with 3326 joy 5479, saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962, even 2532 the devils 1140 are subject 5293 5743 unto us 2254 through 1722 thy 4675 name 3686. 

10:18 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, I beheld 2334 5707 Satan 4567 as 5613 lightning 796 fall 4098 5631 from 1537 heaven 3772. 

10:19 Behold 2400 5628, I give 1325 5719 unto you 5213 power 1849 to tread 3961 5721 on 1883 serpents 3789 and 2532 scorpions 4651, and 2532 over 1909 all 3956 the power 1411 of the enemy 2190: and 2532 nothing 3762 shall 91 0 by any means 3364 hurt 91 5661 5625 91 5692 you 5209. 

10:20 Notwithstanding 4133 in 1722 this 5129 rejoice 5463 5720 not 3361, that 3754 the spirits 4151 are subject 5293 5743 unto you 5213; but 1161 rather 3123 rejoice 5463 5720, because 3754 your 5216 names 3686 are written 1125 5648 in 1722 heaven 3772. 

10:21 In 1722 that 846 hour 5610 Jesus 2424 rejoiced in 21 5662 spirit 4151, and 2532 said 2036 5627, I thank 1843 5731 thee 4671, O Father 3962, Lord 2962 of heaven 3772 and 2532 earth 1093, that 3754 thou hast hid 613 5656 these things 5023 from 575 the wise 4680 and 2532 prudent 4908, and 2532 hast revealed 601 5656 them 846 unto babes 3516: even so 3483, Father 3962; for 3754 so 3779 it seemed 1096 5633 good 2107 in 1715 0 thy 4675 sight 1715. 

10:22 All things 3956 are delivered 3860 5681 to me 3427 of 5259 my 3450 Father 3962: and 2532 no man 3762 knoweth 1097 5719 who 5101 the Son 5207 is 2076 5748, but 1508 the Father 3962; and 2532 who 5101 the Father 3962 is 2076 5748, but 1508 the Son 5207, and 2532 [he] to whom 3739 1437 the Son 5207 will 1014 5741 reveal 601 5658 [him]. 

10:23 And 2532 he turned him 4762 5651 unto 4314 [his] disciples 3101, and said 2036 5627 privately 2398 2596, Blessed 3107 [are] the eyes 3788 which 3588 see 991 5723 the things that 3739 ye 5210 see 991 5719: 

10:24 For 1063 I tell 3004 5719 you 5213, that 3754 many 4183 prophets 4396 and 2532 kings 935 have desired 2309 5656 to see 1492 5629 those things which 3739 ye 5210 see 991 5719, and 2532 have 1492 0 not 3756 seen 1492 5627 [them]; and 2532 to hear 191 5658 those things which 3739 ye hear 191 5719, and 2532 have 191 0 not 3756 heard 191 5656 [them]. 

10:25 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, a certain 5100 lawyer 3544 stood up 450 5627, and 2532 tempted 1598 5723 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Master 1320, what 5101 shall I do 4160 5660 to inherit 2816 5692 5661 eternal 166 life 2222? 

10:26 1161 He said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, What 5101 is written 1125 5769 in 1722 the law 3551? how 4459 readest thou 314 5719? 

10:27 And 1161 he answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627, Thou shalt love 25 5692 the Lord 2962 thy 4675 God 2316 with 1537 all 3650 thy 4675 heart 2588, and 2532 with 1537 all 3650 thy 4675 soul 5590, and 2532 with 1537 all 3650 thy 4675 strength 2479, and 2532 with 1537 all 3650 thy 4675 mind 1271; and 2532 thy 4675 neighbour 4139 as 5613 thyself 4572. 

10:28 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Thou hast answered 611 5662 right 3723: this 5124 do 4160 5720, and 2532 thou shalt live 2198 5692. 

10:29 But 1161 he, willing 2309 5723 to justify 1344 5721 himself 1438, said 2036 5627 unto 4314 Jesus 2424, And 2532 who 5101 is 2076 5748 my 3450 neighbour 4139? 

10:30 And 1161 Jesus 2424 answering 5274 5631 said 2036 5627, A certain 5100 [man] 444 went down 2597 5707 from 575 Jerusalem 2419 to 1519 Jericho 2410, and 2532 fell among 4045 5627 thieves 3027, which 3739 2532 stripped 1562 0 him 846 of his raiment 1562 5660, and 2532 wounded 4127 2007 5631 [him], and departed 565 5627, leaving 863 5631 [him] half dead 2253 5177 5723. 

10:31 And 1161 by 2596 chance 4795 there came down 2597 5707 a certain 5100 priest 2409 that 1722 1565 way 3598: and 2532 when he saw 1492 5631 him 846, he passed by on the other side 492 5627. 

10:32 And 1161 likewise 3668 2532 a Levite 3019, when he was 1096 5637 at 2596 the place 5117, came 2064 5631 and 2532 looked 1492 5631 [on him], and passed by on the other side 492 5627. 

10:33 But 1161 a certain 5100 Samaritan 4541, as he journeyed 3593 5723, came 2064 5627 where 2596 he was 846: and 2532 when he saw 1492 5631 him 846, he had compassion 4697 5675 [on him], 

10:34 And 2532 went 4334 5631 to [him], and bound up 2611 5656 his 846 wounds 5134, pouring in 2022 5723 oil 1637 and 2532 wine 3631, and 1161 set 1913 5660 him 846 on 1909 his own 2398 beast 2934, and brought 71 5627 him 846 to 1519 an inn 3829, and 2532 took care 1959 5675 of him 846. 

10:35 And 2532 on 1909 the morrow 839 when he departed 1831 5631, he took out 1544 5631 two 1417 pence 1220, and gave 1325 5656 [them] to the host 3830, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Take care 1959 5682 of him 846; and 2532 whatsoever 3748 302 thou spendest more 4325 5661, when I 3165 come again 1722 1880 5738, I 1473 will repay 591 5692 thee 4671. 

10:36 Which 5101 now 3767 of these 5130 three 5140, thinkest 1380 5719 thou 4671, was 1096 5755 neighbour 4139 unto him that fell 1706 5631 among 1519 the thieves 3027? 

10:37 And 1161 he said 2036 5627, He that shewed 4160 5660 mercy 1656 on 3326 him 846. Then 3767 said 2036 5627 Jesus 2424 unto him 846, Go 4198 5737, and 2532 do 4160 5720 thou 4771 likewise 3668. 

10:38 Now 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, as 1722 they 846 went 4198 5738, that 2532 he 846 entered 1525 5627 into 1519 a certain 5100 village 2968: and 1161 a certain 5100 woman 1135 named 3686 Martha 3136 received 5264 5662 him 846 into 1519 her 848 house 3624. 

10:39 And 2532 she 3592 had 2258 5713 a sister 79 called 2564 5746 Mary 3137, which 3739 also 2532 sat 3869 5660 at 3844 Jesus 2424' feet 4228, and heard 191 5707 his 846 word 3056. 

10:40 But 1161 Martha 3136 was cumbered 4049 5712 about 4012 much 4183 serving 1248, and 1161 came to him 2186 5631, and said 2036 5627, Lord 2962, dost 3199 0 thou 4671 not 3756 care 3199 5719 that 3754 my 3450 sister 79 hath left 2641 5627 me 3165 to serve 1247 5721 alone 3441? bid 2036 5628 her 846 therefore 3767 that 2443 she help 4878 5638 me 3427. 

10:41 And 1161 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto her 846, Martha 3136, Martha 3136, thou art careful 3309 5719 and 2532 troubled 5182 5743 about 4012 many things 4183: 

10:42 But 1161 one thing 1520 is 2076 5748 needful 5532: and 1161 Mary 3137 hath chosen 1586 5668 that good 18 part 3310, which 3748 shall 851 0 not 3756 be taken away 851 5701 from 575 her 846. 

11:1 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, that, as 1722 he 846 was 1511 5750 praying 4336 5740 in 1722 a certain 5100 place 5117, when 5613 he ceased 3973 5668, one 5100 of his 846 disciples 3101 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Lord 2962, teach 1321 5657 us 2248 to pray 4336 5738, as 2531 John 2491 also 2532 taught 1321 5656 his 848 disciples 3101. 

11:2 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, When 3752 ye pray 4336 5741, say 3004 5720, Our 2257 Father 3962 which 3588 art in 1722 heaven 3772, Hallowed be 37 5682 thy 4675 name 3686. Thy 4675 kingdom 932 come 2064 5628. Thy 4675 will 2307 be done 1096 5676, as 5613 in 1722 heaven 3772, so 2532 in 1909 earth 1093. 

11:3 Give 1325 5720 us 2254 day 2596 by day 2250 our 2257 daily 1967 bread 740. 

11:4 And 2532 forgive 863 5628 us 2254 our 2257 sins 266; for 1063 we also 2532 forgive 863 5719 every one 3956 that is indebted 3784 5723 to us 2254. And 2532 lead 1533 5661 us 2248 not 3361 into 1519 temptation 3986; but 235 deliver 4506 5663 us 2248 from 575 evil 4190. 

11:5 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Which 5101 of 1537 you 5216 shall have 2192 5692 a friend 5384, and 2532 shall go 4198 5695 unto 4314 him 846 at midnight 3317, and 2532 say 2036 5632 unto him 846, Friend 5384, lend 5531 5657 me 3427 three 5140 loaves 740; 

11:6 For 1894 a friend 5384 of mine 3450 in 1537 his journey 3598 is come 3854 5633 to 4314 me 3165, and 2532 I have 2192 5719 nothing 3756 3739 to set before 3908 5692 him 846? 

11:7 And he 2548 from within 2081 shall answer 611 5679 and say 2036 5632, Trouble 2873 3930 5720 me 3427 not 3361: the door 2374 is 2808 0 now 2235 shut 2808 5769, and 2532 my 3450 children 3813 are 1526 5748 with 3326 me 1700 in 1519 bed 2845; I cannot 3756 1410 5736 rise 450 5631 and give 1325 5629 thee 4671. 

11:8 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, 2532 Though 1499 he will 1453 0 not 3756 rise 1453 5685 and give 1325 5692 him 846, because 1223 he is 1511 5750 his 846 friend 5384, yet 1065 because 1223 of his 846 importunity 335 he will rise 450 5631 and give 1325 5692 him 846 as many as 3745 he needeth 5535 5719. 

11:9 And 2504 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Ask 154 5720, and 2532 it shall be given 1325 5701 you 5213; seek 2212 5720, and 2532 ye shall find 2147 5692; knock 2925 5720, and 2532 it shall be opened 455 5691 unto you 5213. 

11:10 For 1063 every one 3956 that asketh 154 5723 receiveth 2983 5719; and 2532 he that seeketh 2212 5723 findeth 2147 5719; and 2532 to him that knocketh 2925 5723 it shall be opened 455 5691. 

11:11 If 1161 a son 5207 shall ask 154 5692 bread 740 of any of you 5216 that is a father 3962 5101, will he give 1929 5692 3361 him 846 a stone 3037? or 2532 if [he ask] a fish 2486, will he 1929 0 for 473 a fish 2486 give 1929 5692 3361 him 846 a serpent 3789? 

11:12 Or 2228 2532 if 1437 he shall ask 154 5661 an egg 5609, will he offer 3361 1929 5692 him 846 a scorpion 4651? 

11:13 If 1487 ye 5210 then 3767, being 5225 5723 evil 4190, know 1492 5758 how to give 1325 5721 good 18 gifts 1390 unto your 5216 children 5043: how much 4214 more 3123 shall 1325 0 [your] heavenly 3772 Father 3962 1537 give 1325 5692 the Holy 40 Spirit 4151 to them that ask 154 5723 him 846? 

11:14 And 2532 he was 2258 5713 casting out 1544 5723 a devil 1140, and 2532 it 846 was 2258 5713 dumb 2974. And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, when the devil 1140 was gone out 1831 5631, the dumb 2974 spake 2980 5656; and 2532 the people 3793 wondered 2296 5656. 

11:15 But 1161 some 5100 of 1537 them 846 said 2036 5627, He casteth out 1544 5719 devils 1140 through 1722 Beelzebub 954 the chief 758 of the devils 1140. 

11:16 And 1161 others 2087, tempting 3985 5723 [him], sought 2212 5707 of 3844 him 846 a sign 4592 from 1537 heaven 3772. 

11:17 But 1161 he 846, knowing 1492 5761 their 846 thoughts 1270, said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Every 3956 kingdom 932 divided 1266 5685 against 1909 itself 1438 is brought to desolation 2049 5743; and 2532 a house 3624 [divided] against 1909 a house 3624 falleth 4098 5719. 

11:18 If 1161 1499 0 Satan 4567 also 1499 be divided 1266 5681 against 1909 himself 1438, how 4459 shall 2476 0 his 846 kingdom 932 stand 2476 5701? because 3754 ye say 3004 5719 that I 3165 cast out 1544 5721 devils 1140 through 1722 Beelzebub 954. 

11:19 And 1161 if 1487 I 1473 by 1722 Beelzebub 954 cast out 1544 5719 devils 1140, by 1722 whom 5101 do 1544 0 your 5216 sons 5207 cast [them] out 1544 5719? therefore 1223 5124 shall they be 2071 5704 your 5216 judges 2923. 

11:20 But 1161 if 1487 I with 1722 the finger 1147 of God 2316 cast out 1544 5719 devils 1140, no doubt 686 the kingdom 932 of God 2316 is come 5348 5656 upon 1909 you 5209. 

11:21 When 3752 a strong man 2478 armed 2528 5772 keepeth 5442 5725 his 833 palace 1438, his 846 goods 5224 5723 are 2076 5748 in 1722 peace 1515: 

11:22 But 1161 when 1875 a stronger 2478 than he 846 shall come upon him 1904 5631, and overcome 3528 5661 him 846, he taketh 142 5719 from him 846 all his armour 3833 wherein 1909 3739 he trusted 3982 5714, and 2532 divideth 1239 5719 his 846 spoils 4661. 

11:23 He that is 5607 5752 not 3361 with 3326 me 1700 is 2076 5748 against 2596 me 1700: and 2532 he that gathereth 4863 5723 not 3361 with 3326 me 1700 scattereth 4650 5719. 

11:24 When 3752 the unclean 169 spirit 4151 is gone 1831 5632 out of 575 a man 444, he walketh 1330 5736 through 1223 dry 504 places 5117, seeking 2212 5723 rest 372; and 2532 finding 2147 5723 none 3361, he saith 3004 5719, I will return 5290 5692 unto 1519 my 3450 house 3624 whence 3606 I came out 1831 5627. 

11:25 And 2532 when he cometh 2064 5631, he findeth 2147 5719 [it] swept 4563 5772 and 2532 garnished 2885 5772. 

11:26 Then 5119 goeth he 4198 5736, and 2532 taketh 3880 5719 [to him] seven 2033 other 2087 spirits 4151 more wicked 4191 than himself 1438; and 2532 they enter in 1525 5631, and dwell 2730 5719 there 1563: and 2532 the last 2078 [state] of that 1565 man 444 is 1096 5736 worse 5501 than the first 4413. 

11:27 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, as 1722 he 846 spake 3004 5721 these things 5023, a certain 5100 woman 1135 of 1537 the company 3793 lifted up 1869 5660 her voice 5456, and said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Blessed 3107 [is] the womb 2836 that bare 941 5660 thee 4571, and 2532 the paps 3149 which 3739 thou hast sucked 2337 5656. 

11:28 But 1161 he said 2036 5627, Yea rather 3304, blessed 3107 [are] they that hear 191 5723 the word 3056 of God 2316, and 2532 keep 5442 5723 it 846. 

11:29 And 1161 when the people 3793 were gathered thick together 1865 5746, he began 756 5662 to say 3004 5721, This 3778 is 2076 5748 an evil 4190 generation 1074: they seek 1934 5719 a sign 4592; and 2532 there shall 1325 0 no 3756 sign 4592 be given 1325 5701 it 846, but 1508 the sign 4592 of Jonas 2495 the prophet 4396. 

11:30 For 1063 as 2531 Jonas 2495 was 1096 5633 a sign 4592 unto the Ninevites 3536, so 3779 shall 2071 0 also 2532 the Son 5207 of man 444 be 2071 5704 to this 5026 generation 1074. 

11:31 The queen 938 of the south 3558 shall rise up 1453 5701 in 1722 the judgment 2920 with 3326 the men 435 of this 5026 generation 1074, and 2532 condemn 2632 5692 them 846: for 3754 she came 2064 5627 from 1537 the utmost parts 4009 of the earth 1093 to hear 191 5658 the wisdom 4678 of Solomon 4672; and 2532, behold 2400 5628, a greater than 4119 Solomon 4672 [is] here 5602. 

11:32 The men 435 of Nineve 3535 shall rise up 450 5698 in 1722 the judgment 2920 with 3326 this 5026 generation 1074, and 2532 shall condemn 2632 5692 it 846: for 3754 they repented 3340 5656 at 1519 the preaching 2782 of Jonas 2495; and 2532, behold 2400 5628, a greater than 4119 Jonas 2495 [is] here 5602. 

11:33 1161 No man 3762, when he hath lighted 681 5660 a candle 3088, putteth 5087 5719 [it] in 1519 a secret place 2926, neither 3761 under 5259 a bushel 3426, but 235 on 1909 a candlestick 3087, that 2443 they which 3588 come in 1531 5740 may see 991 5725 the light 5338. 

11:34 The light 3088 of the body 4983 is 2076 5748 the eye 3788: therefore 3767 when 1875 thine 4675 eye 3788 is 5600 5753 single 573, thy 4675 whole 3650 body 4983 also 2532 is 2076 5748 full of light 5460; but 1161 when 3752 [thine eye] is 5600 5753 evil 4190, thy 4675 body 4983 also 2532 [is] full of darkness 4652. 

11:35 Take heed 4648 5720 therefore 3767 that the light 5457 which 3588 is in 1722 thee 4671 be 2076 5748 not 3361 darkness 4655. 

11:36 If 1487 thy 4675 whole 3650 body 4983 therefore 3767 [be] full of light 5460, having 2192 5723 no 3361 5100 part 3313 dark 4652, the whole 3650 shall be 2071 5704 full of light 5460, as 5613 when 3752 the bright shining 796 of a candle 3088 doth give 5461 0 thee 4571 light 5461 5725. 

11:37 And 1161 as 1722 he spake 2980 5658, a certain 5100 Pharisee 5330 besought 2065 5707 him 846 to 3704 dine 709 5661 with 3844 him 846: and 1161 he went in 1525 5631, and sat down to meat 377 5627. 

11:38 And 1161 when the Pharisee 5330 saw 1492 5631 [it], he marvelled 2296 5656 that 3754 he had 907 0 not 3756 first 4412 washed 907 5681 before 4253 dinner 712. 

11:39 And 1161 the Lord 2962 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Now 3568 do 2511 0 ye 5210 Pharisees 5330 make clean 2511 5719 the outside 1855 of the cup 4221 and 2532 the platter 4094; but 1161 your 5216 inward part 2081 is full 1073 5719 of ravening 724 and 2532 wickedness 4189. 

11:40 [Ye] fools 878, did 4160 0 not 3756 he that made 4160 5660 that which 3588 is without 1855 make 4160 5656 that which 3588 is within 2081 also 2532? 

11:41 But rather 4133 give 1325 5628 alms 1654 of such things as ye have 1751 5752; and 2532, behold 2400 5628, all things 3956 are 2076 5748 clean 2513 unto you 5213. 

11:42 But 235 woe 3759 unto you 5213, Pharisees 5330! for 3754 ye tithe 586 5719 mint 2238 and 2532 rue 4076 and 2532 all manner 3956 of herbs 3001, and 2532 pass over 3928 5736 judgment 2920 and 2532 the love 26 of God 2316: these 5023 ought ye 1163 5713 to have done 4160 5658, and not 3361 to leave 863 0 the other 2548 undone 863 5721. 

11:43 Woe 3759 unto you 5213, Pharisees 5330! for 3754 ye love 25 5719 the uppermost seats 4410 in 1722 the synagogues 4864, and 2532 greetings 783 in 1722 the markets 58. 

11:44 Woe 3759 unto you 5213, scribes 1122 and 2532 Pharisees 5330, hypocrites 5273! for 3754 ye are 2075 5748 as 5613 graves 3419 which 3588 appear not 82, and 2532 the men 444 that walk 4043 5723 over 1883 [them] are 1492 0 not 3756 aware 1492 5758 [of them]. 

11:45 Then 1161 answered 611 5679 one 5100 of the lawyers 3544, and said 3004 5719 unto him 846, Master 1320, thus 5023 saying 3004 5723 thou reproachest 5195 5719 us 2248 also 2532. 

11:46 And 1161 he said 2036 5627, Woe 3759 unto you 5213 also 2532, [ye] lawyers 3544! for 3754 ye lade 5412 5719 men 444 with burdens 5413 grievous to be borne 1419, and 2532 ye yourselves 846 touch 4379 5719 not 3756 the burdens 5413 with one 1520 of your 5216 fingers 1147. 

11:47 Woe 3759 unto you 5213! for 3754 ye build 3618 5719 the sepulchres 3419 of the prophets 4396, and 1161 your 5216 fathers 3962 killed 615 5656 them 846. 

11:48 Truly 686 ye bear witness 3140 5719 that 2532 ye allow 4909 5719 the deeds 2041 of your 5216 fathers 3962: for 3754 they 846 indeed 3303 killed 615 5656 them 846, and 1161 ye 5210 build 3618 5719 their 846 sepulchres 3419. 

11:49 Therefore 1223 5124 also 2532 said 2036 5627 the wisdom 4678 of God 2316, I will send 649 5692 1519 them 846 prophets 4396 and 2532 apostles 652, and 2532 [some] of 1537 them 846 they shall slay 615 5692 and 2532 persecute 1559 5692: 

11:50 That 2443 the blood 129 of all 3956 the prophets 4396, which 3588 was shed 1632 5746 from 575 the foundation 2602 of the world 2889, may be required 1567 5686 of 575 this 5026 generation 1074; 

11:51 From 575 the blood 129 of Abel 6 unto 2193 the blood 129 of Zacharias 2197, which 3588 perished 622 5642 between 3342 the altar 2379 and 2532 the temple 3624: verily 3483 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, It shall be required 1567 5701 of 575 this 5026 generation 1074. 

11:52 Woe 3759 unto you 5213, lawyers 3544! for 3754 ye have taken away 142 5656 the key 2807 of knowledge 1108: ye entered 1525 0 not 3756 in 1525 5627 yourselves 846, and 2532 them that were entering in 1525 5740 ye hindered 2967 5656. 

11:53 And 1161 as he said 3004 5723 these things 5023 unto 4314 them 846, the scribes 1122 and 2532 the Pharisees 5330 began 756 5662 to urge 1758 5721 [him] vehemently 1171, and 2532 to provoke 653 0 him 846 to speak 653 5721 of 4012 many things 4119: 

11:54 Laying wait for 1748 5723 him 846, and 2532 seeking 2212 5723 to catch 2340 5658 something 5100 out of 1537 his 846 mouth 4750, that 2443 they might accuse 2723 5661 him 846. 

12:1 In 1722 the mean time 3739, when there were gathered together 1996 5685 an innumerable multitude 3461 of people 3793, insomuch that 5620 they trode 2662 5721 one upon another 240, he began 756 5662 to say 3004 5721 unto 4314 his 848 disciples 3101 first of all 4412, Beware 4337 5720 ye 1438 of 575 the leaven 2219 of the Pharisees 5330, which 3748 is 2076 5748 hypocrisy 5272. 

12:2 For 1161 there is 2076 5748 nothing 3762 covered 4780 5772, that 3739 shall 601 0 not 3756 be revealed 601 5701; neither 2532 hid 2927, that 3739 shall 1097 0 not 3756 be known 1097 5701. 

12:3 Therefore 473 3739 whatsoever 3745 ye have spoken 2036 5627 in 1722 darkness 4653 shall be heard 191 5701 in 1722 the light 5457; and 2532 that which 3739 ye have spoken 2980 5656 in 4314 the ear 3775 in 1722 closets 5009 shall be proclaimed 2784 5701 upon 1909 the housetops 1430. 

12:4 And 1161 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213 my 3450 friends 5384, Be 5399 0 not 3361 afraid 5399 5676 of them 575 that kill 615 5723 the body 4983, and 2532 after 3326 that 5023 have 2192 5723 no 3361 5100 more 4055 that they can do 4160 5658. 

12:5 But 1161 I will forewarn 5263 5692 you 5213 whom 5101 ye shall fear 5399 5680: Fear 5399 5676 him, which after 3326 he hath killed 615 5658 hath 2192 5723 power 1849 to cast 1685 5629 into 1519 hell 1067; yea 3483, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Fear 5399 5676 him 5126. 

12:6 Are 4453 0 not 3780 five 4002 sparrows 4765 sold 4453 5743 for two 1417 farthings 787, and 2532 not 3756 one 1520 of 1537 them 846 is 2076 5748 forgotten 1950 5772 before 1799 God 2316? 

12:7 But 235 even the very 2532 hairs 2359 of your 5216 head 2776 are 705 0 all 3956 numbered 705 5769. Fear 5399 5737 not 3361 therefore 3767: ye are of more value 1308 5719 than many 4183 sparrows 4765. 

12:8 Also 1161 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Whosoever 3956 3739 302 shall confess 3670 5661 1722 me 1698 before 1715 men 444, 1722 him 846 shall 3670 0 the Son 5207 of man 444 also 2532 confess 3670 5692 before 1715 the angels 32 of God 2316: 

12:9 But 1161 he that denieth 720 5666 me 3165 before 1799 men 444 shall be denied 533 5701 before 1799 the angels 32 of God 2316. 

12:10 And 2532 whosoever 3956 3739 shall speak 2046 5692 a word 3056 against 1519 the Son 5207 of man 444, it shall be forgiven 863 5701 him 846: but 1161 unto him that blasphemeth 987 5660 against 1519 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 it shall 863 0 not 3756 be forgiven 863 5701. 

12:11 And 1161 when 3752 they bring 4374 5725 you 5209 unto 1909 the synagogues 4864, and 2532 [unto] magistrates 746, and 2532 powers 1849, take 3309 0 ye no 3361 thought 3309 5720 how 4459 or 2228 what thing 5101 ye shall answer 626 5667, or 2228 what 5101 ye shall say 2036 5632: 

12:12 For 1063 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 shall teach 1321 5692 you 5209 in 1722 the same 846 hour 5610 what 3739 ye ought 1163 5748 to say 2036 5629. 

12:13 And 1161 one 5100 of 1537 the company 3793 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Master 1320, speak 2036 5628 to my 3450 brother 80, that he divide 3307 5670 the inheritance 2817 with 3326 me 1700. 

12:14 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Man 444, who 5101 made 2525 5656 me 3165 a judge 1348 or 2228 a divider 3312 over 1909 you 5209? 

12:15 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Take heed 3708 5720, and 2532 beware 5442 5732 of 575 covetousness 4124: for 3754 a man's 5100 life 2222 consisteth 2076 5748 not 3756 in 1722 the abundance 4052 5721 of 1537 the things which he 846 possesseth 5224 5723. 

12:16 And 1161 he spake 2036 5627 a parable 3850 unto 4314 them 846, saying 3004 5723, The ground 5561 of a certain 5100 rich 4145 man 444 brought forth plentifully 2164 5656: 

12:17 And 2532 he thought 1260 5711 within 1722 himself 1438, saying 3004 5723, What 5101 shall I do 4160 5661, because 3754 I have 2192 5719 no 3756 room where 4226 to bestow 4863 5692 my 3450 fruits 2590? 

12:18 And 2532 he said 2036 5627, This 5124 will I do 4160 5692: I will pull down 2507 5692 my 3450 barns 596, and 2532 build 3618 5692 greater 3187; and 2532 there 1563 will I bestow 4863 5692 all 3956 my 3450 fruits 1081 and 2532 my 3450 goods 18. 

12:19 And 2532 I will say 2046 5692 to my 3450 soul 5590, Soul 5590, thou hast 2192 5719 much 4183 goods 18 laid up 2749 5740 for 1519 many 4183 years 2094; take thine ease 373 5732, eat 5315 5628, drink 4095 5628, [and] be merry 2165 5744. 

12:20 But 1161 God 2316 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, [Thou] fool 878, this 5026 night 3571 thy 4675 soul 5590 shall be required 523 5719 of 575 thee 4675: then 1161 whose 5101 shall those things be 2071 5704, which 3739 thou hast provided 2090 5656? 

12:21 So 3779 [is] he that layeth up treasure 2343 5723 for himself 1438, and 2532 is 4147 0 not 3361 rich 4147 5723 toward 1519 God 2316. 

12:22 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 his 848 disciples 3101, Therefore 1223 5124 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Take 3309 0 no 3361 thought 3309 5720 for your 5216 life 5590, what 5101 ye shall eat 5315 5632; neither 3366 for the body 4983, what 5101 ye shall put on 1746 5672. 

12:23 The life 5590 is 2076 5748 more 4119 than meat 5160, and 2532 the body 4983 [is more] than raiment 1742. 

12:24 Consider 2657 5657 the ravens 2876: for 3754 they neither 3756 sow 4687 5719 nor 3761 reap 2325 5719; which 3739 neither 3756 have 2076 5748 storehouse 5009 nor 3761 barn 596; and 2532 God 2316 feedeth 5142 5719 them 846: how much 4214 more 3123 are 1308 0 ye 5210 better than 1308 5719 the fowls 4071? 

12:25 And 1161 which 5101 of 1537 you 5216 with taking thought 3309 5723 can 1410 5736 add 4369 5629 to 1909 his 848 stature 2244 one 1520 cubit 4083? 

12:26 If 1487 ye then 3767 be 1410 0 not 3777 able to do 1410 5736 that thing which is least 1646, why 5101 take ye thought 3309 5719 for 4012 the rest 3062? 

12:27 Consider 2657 5657 the lilies 2918 how 4459 they grow 837 5719: they toil 2872 5719 not 3756, they spin 3514 5719 not 3761; and yet 1161 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, that Solomon 4672 in 1722 all 3956 his 848 glory 1391 was 4016 0 not 3761 arrayed 4016 5639 like 5613 one 1520 of these 5130. 

12:28 If 1487 then 1161 God 2316 so 3779 clothe 294 5719 the grass 5528, which 5607 5752 is to day 4594 in 1722 the field 68, and 2532 to morrow 839 is cast 906 5746 into 1519 the oven 2823; how much 4214 more 3123 [will he clothe] you 5209, O ye of little faith 3640? 

12:29 And 2532 seek 2212 5720 not 3361 ye 5210 what 5101 ye shall eat 5315 5632, or 2228 what 5101 ye shall drink 4095 5632, 2532 neither 3361 be ye of doubtful mind 3349 5744. 

12:30 For 1063 all 3956 these things 5023 do 1934 0 the nations 1484 of the world 2889 seek after 1934 5719: and 1161 your 5216 Father 3962 knoweth 1492 5758 that 3754 ye have need 5535 5719 of these things 5130. 

12:31 But rather 4133 seek ye 2212 5720 the kingdom 932 of God 2316; and 2532 all 3956 these things 5023 shall be added 4369 5701 unto you 5213. 

12:32 Fear 5399 5732 5737 not 3361, little 3398 flock 4168; for 3754 it is 2106 0 your 5216 Father's 3962 good pleasure 2106 5656 to give 1325 5629 you 5213 the kingdom 932. 

12:33 Sell 4453 5657 that ye 5216 have 5224 5723, and 2532 give 1325 5628 alms 1654; provide 4160 5657 yourselves 1438 bags 905 which wax 3822 0 not 3361 old 3822 5746, a treasure 2344 in 1722 the heavens 3772 that faileth not 413, where 3699 no 3756 thief 2812 approacheth 1448 5719, neither 3761 moth 4597 corrupteth 1311 5719. 

12:34 For 1063 where 3699 your 5216 treasure 2344 is 2076 5748, there 1563 will 2071 0 your 5216 heart 2588 be 2071 5704 also 2532. 

12:35 Let 2077 0 your 5216 loins 3751 be 2077 5749 girded about 4024 5772, and 2532 [your] lights 3088 burning 2545 5746; 

12:36 And 2532 ye yourselves 5210 like 3664 unto men 444 that wait 4327 5740 for their 1438 lord 2962, when 4219 he will return 360 5692 from 1537 the wedding 1062; that 2443 when he cometh 2064 5631 and 2532 knocketh 2925 5660, they may open 455 5661 unto him 846 immediately 2112. 

12:37 Blessed 3107 [are] those 1565 servants 1401, whom 3739 the lord 2962 when he cometh 2064 5631 shall find 2147 5692 watching 1127 5723: verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, that 3754 he shall gird himself 4024 5698, and 2532 make 347 0 them 846 to sit down to meat 347 5692, and 2532 will come forth 3928 5631 and serve 1247 5692 them 846. 

12:38 And 2532 if 1437 he shall come 2064 5632 in 1722 the second 1208 watch 5438, or 2532 come 2064 5632 in 1722 the third 5154 watch 5438, and 2532 find 2147 5632 [them] so 3779, blessed 3107 are 1526 5748 those 1565 servants 1401. 

12:39 And 1161 this 5124 know 1097 5720, that 3754 if 1487 the goodman of the house 3617 had known 1492 5715 what 4169 hour 5610 the thief 2812 would come 2064 5736, 302 he would have watched 1127 5656, and 2532 302 not 3756 have suffered 863 5656 his 848 house 3624 to be broken through 1358 5650. 

12:40 Be 1096 5737 ye 5210 therefore 3767 ready 2092 also 2532: for 3754 3739 the Son 5207 of man 444 cometh 2064 5736 at an hour 5610 when ye think 1380 5719 not 3756. 

12:41 Then 1161 Peter 4074 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Lord 2962, speakest thou 3004 5719 this 5026 parable 3850 unto 4314 us 2248, or 2228 even 2532 to 4314 all 3956? 

12:42 And 1161 the Lord 2962 said 2036 5627, Who 5101 then 686 is 2076 5748 that faithful 4103 and 2532 wise 5429 steward 3623, whom 3739 [his] lord 2962 shall make ruler 2525 5692 over 1909 his 848 household 2322, to give 1325 5721 [them their] portion of meat 4620 in 1722 due season 2540? 

12:43 Blessed 3107 [is] that 1565 servant 1401, whom 3739 his 846 lord 2962 when he cometh 2064 5631 shall find 2147 5692 so 3779 doing 4160 5723. 

12:44 Of a truth 230 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, that 3754 he will make him ruler 2525 5692 over 1909 all 3956 that he 848 hath 5224 5723. 

12:45 But and 1161 if 1437 that 1565 servant 1401 say 2036 5632 in 1722 his 848 heart 2588, My 3450 lord 2962 delayeth 5549 5719 his coming 2064 5738; and 2532 shall begin 756 5672 to beat 5180 5721 the menservants 3816 and 2532 maidens 3814, and 5037 to eat 2068 5721 and 2532 drink 4095 5721, and 2532 to be drunken 3182 5745; 

12:46 The lord 2962 of that 1565 servant 1401 will come 2240 5692 in 1722 a day 2250 when 3739 he looketh 4328 0 not 3756 for 4328 5719 [him], and 2532 at 1722 an hour 5610 when 3739 he is 1097 0 not 3756 aware 1097 5719, and 2532 will cut 1371 0 him 846 in sunder 1371 5692, and 2532 will appoint 5087 5692 him his 846 portion 3313 with 3326 the unbelievers 571. 

12:47 And 1161 that 1565 servant 1401, which 3588 knew 1097 5631 his 1438 lord's 2962 will 2307, and 2532 prepared 2090 5660 not 3361 [himself], neither 3366 did 4160 5660 according 4314 to his will 2307, shall be beaten 1194 5691 with many 4183 [stripes]. 

12:48 But 1161 he that knew 1097 5631 not 3361, and 1161 did commit 4160 5660 things worthy 514 of stripes 4127, shall be beaten 1194 5691 with few 3641 [stripes]. For 1161 unto whomsoever 3739 3956 much 4183 is given 1325 5681, of 3844 him 846 shall be much 4183 required 2212 5701: and 2532 to whom men 3739 have committed 3908 5639 much 4183, of him 846 they will ask 154 5692 the more 4055. 

12:49 I am come 2064 5627 to send 906 5629 fire 4442 on 1519 the earth 1093; and 2532 what 5101 will I 2309 5719, if 1487 it be 381 0 already 2235 kindled 381 5681? 

12:50 But 1161 I have 2192 5719 a baptism 908 to be baptized with 907 5683; and 2532 how 4459 am I straitened 4912 5743 till 2193 it be accomplished 5055 5686! 

12:51 Suppose ye 1380 5719 that 3754 I am come 3854 5633 to give 1325 5629 peace 1515 on 1722 earth 1093? I tell 3004 5719 you 5213, Nay 3780; but 235 rather 2228 division 1267: 

12:52 For 1063 from 575 henceforth 3568 there shall be 2071 5704 five 4002 in 1722 one 1520 house 3624 divided 1266 5772, three 5140 against 1909 two 1417, and 2532 two 1417 against 1909 three 5140. 

12:53 The father 3962 shall be divided 1266 5701 against 1909 the son 5207, and 2532 the son 5207 against 1909 the father 3962; the mother 3384 against 1909 the daughter 2364, and 2532 the daughter 2364 against 1909 the mother 3384; the mother in law 3994 against 1909 her 848 daughter in law 3565, and 2532 the daughter in law 3565 against 1909 her 848 mother in law 3994. 

12:54 And 1161 he said 3004 5707 also 2532 to the people 3793, When 3752 ye see 1492 5632 a cloud 3507 rise 393 5723 out of 575 the west 1424, straightway 2112 ye say 3004 5719, There cometh 2064 5736 a shower 3655; and 2532 so 3779 it is 1096 5736. 

12:55 And 2532 when 3752 [ye see] the south wind 3558 blow 4154 5723, ye say 3004 5719, 3754 There will be 2071 5704 heat 2742; and 2532 it cometh to pass 1096 5736. 

12:56 [Ye] hypocrites 5273, ye can 1492 5758 discern 1381 5721 the face 4383 of the sky 3772 and 2532 of the earth 1093; but 1161 how is it 4459 that ye do not 3756 discern 1381 5719 this 5126 time 2540? 

12:57 Yea 1161, and why 5101 even 2532 of 575 yourselves 1438 judge ye 2919 5719 not 3756 what is right 1342? 

12:58 When 5613 1063 thou goest 5217 5719 with 3326 thine 4675 adversary 476 to 1909 the magistrate 758, [as thou art] in 1722 the way 3598, give 1325 5628 diligence 2039 that thou mayest be delivered 525 5771 from 575 him 846; lest 3379 he hale 2694 5661 thee 4571 to 4314 the judge 2923, and 2532 the judge 2923 deliver 3860 5632 thee 4571 to the officer 4233, and 2532 the officer 4233 cast 906 5725 thee 4571 into 1519 prison 5438. 

12:59 I tell 3004 5719 thee 4671, thou shalt 1831 0 not 3364 depart 1831 5632 thence 1564, 2532 till 2193 3739 thou hast paid 591 5632 the very last 2078 mite 3016. 

13:1 1161 There were present 3918 5713 at 1722 that season 846 2540 some 5100 that told 518 5723 him 846 of 4012 the Galilaeans 1057, whose 3739 blood 129 Pilate 4091 had mingled 3396 5656 with 3326 their 846 sacrifices 2378. 

13:2 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Suppose ye 1380 5719 that 3754 these 3778 Galilaeans 1057 were 1096 5633 sinners 268 above 3844 all 3956 the Galilaeans 1057, because 3754 they suffered 3958 5754 such things 5108? 

13:3 I tell 3004 5719 you 5213, Nay 3780: but 235, except 3362 ye repent 3340 5725, ye shall 622 0 all 3956 likewise 5615 perish 622 5698. 

13:4 Or 2228 those 1565 eighteen 1176 2532 3638, upon 1909 whom 3739 the tower 4444 in 1722 Siloam 4611 fell 4098 5627, and 2532 slew 615 5656 them 846, think ye 1380 5719 that 3754 they 3778 were 1096 5633 sinners 3781 above 3844 all 3956 men 444 that dwelt 2730 5723 in 1722 Jerusalem 2419? 

13:5 I tell 3004 5719 you 5213, Nay 3780: but 235, except 3362 ye repent 3340 5725, ye shall 622 0 all 3956 likewise 3668 perish 622 5698. 

13:6 He spake 3004 5707 also 1161 this 5026 parable 3850; A certain 5100 [man] had 2192 5707 a fig tree 4808 planted 5452 5772 in 1722 his 848 vineyard 290; and 2532 he came 2064 5627 and sought 2212 5723 fruit 2590 thereon 1722 846, and 2532 found 2147 5627 none 3756. 

13:7 Then 1161 said he 2036 5627 unto 4314 the dresser of his vineyard 289, Behold 2400 5628, these three 5140 years 2094 I come 2064 5736 seeking 2212 5723 fruit 2590 on 1722 this 5026 fig tree 4808, and 2532 find 2147 5719 none 3756: cut 1581 0 it 846 down 1581 5657; why 2444 2532 cumbereth 2673 5719 it 846 the ground 1093? 

13:8 And 1161 he answering 611 5679 said 3004 5719 unto him 846, Lord 2962, let 863 0 it 846 alone 863 5628 this 5124 year 2094 also 2532, till 2193 3755 I shall dig 4626 5661 about 4012 it 846, and 2532 dung 906 5632 2874 [it]: 

13:9 And if 2579 3303 it bear 4160 5661 fruit 2590, [well]: and if not 1490, [then] after that 1519 3195 5723 thou shalt cut 1581 0 it 846 down 1581 5692. 

13:10 And 1161 he was 2258 5713 teaching 1321 5723 in 1722 one 3391 of the synagogues 4864 on 1722 the sabbath 4521. 

13:11 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, there was 2258 5713 a woman 1135 which had 2192 5723 a spirit 4151 of infirmity 769 eighteen 1176 2532 3638 years 2094, and 2532 was 2258 5713 bowed together 4794 5723, and 2532 could 1410 5740 in 1519 no 3361 wise 3838 lift up 352 5658 [herself]. 

13:12 And 1161 when Jesus 2424 saw 1492 5631 her 846, he called 4377 5656 [her to him], and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto her 846, Woman 1135, thou art loosed 630 5769 from thine 4675 infirmity 769. 

13:13 And 2532 he laid 2007 0 [his] hands 5495 on 2007 5656 her 846: and 2532 immediately 3916 she was made straight 461 5681, and 2532 glorified 1392 5707 God 2316. 

13:14 And 1161 the ruler of the synagogue 752 answered 611 5679 with indignation 23 5723, because 3754 that Jesus 2424 had healed 2323 5656 on the sabbath 4521 day, and said 3004 5707 unto the people 3793, There are 1526 5748 six 1803 days 2250 in 1722 which 3739 men ought 1163 5748 to work 2038 5738: in 1722 them 5025 therefore 3767 come 2064 5740 and be healed 2323 5744, and 2532 not 3361 on the sabbath 4521 day 2250. 

13:15 The Lord 2962 then 3767 answered 611 5662 him 846, and 2532 said 2036 5627, [Thou] hypocrite 5273, doth 3089 0 not 3756 each one 1538 of you 5216 on the sabbath 4521 loose 3089 5719 his 848 ox 1016 or 2228 [his] ass 3688 from 575 the stall 5336, and 2532 lead [him] away 520 5631 to watering 4222 5719? 

13:16 And 1161 ought 1163 5713 not 3756 this woman 5026, being 5607 5752 a daughter 2364 of Abraham 11, whom 3739 Satan 4567 hath bound 1210 5656, lo 2400 5628, these eighteen 1176 2532 3638 years 2094, be loosed 3089 5683 from 575 this 5127 bond 1199 on the sabbath 4521 day 2250? 

13:17 And 2532 when he had said 3004 5723 these things 5023, all 3956 his 846 adversaries 480 5740 were ashamed 2617 5712: and 2532 all 3956 the people 3793 rejoiced 5463 5707 for 1909 all 3956 the glorious things 1741 that were done 1096 5740 by 5259 him 846. 

13:18 Then 1161 said he 3004 5707, Unto what 5101 is 2076 5748 the kingdom 932 of God 2316 like 3664? and 2532 whereunto 5101 shall I resemble 3666 5692 it 846? 

13:19 It is 2076 5748 like 3664 a grain 2848 of mustard seed 4615, which 3739 a man 444 took 2983 5631, and cast 906 5627 into 1519 his 1438 garden 2779; and 2532 it grew 837 5656, and 2532 waxed 1096 5633 1519 a great 3173 tree 1186; and 2532 the fowls 4071 of the air 3772 lodged 2681 5656 in 1722 the branches 2798 of it 846. 

13:20 And 2532 again 3825 he said 2036 5627, Whereunto 5101 shall I liken 3666 5692 the kingdom 932 of God 2316? 

13:21 It is 2076 5748 like 3664 leaven 2219, which 3739 a woman 1135 took 2983 5631 and hid 1470 5656 in 1519 three 5140 measures 4568 of meal 224, till 2193 the whole 3650 was leavened 2220 5681. 

13:22 And 2532 he went 1279 5711 through 2596 the cities 4172 and 2532 villages 2968, teaching 1321 5723, and 2532 journeying 4160 5734 4197 toward 1519 Jerusalem 2419. 

13:23 Then 1161 said 2036 5627 one 5100 unto 4314 him 846, Lord 2962, are there few 1487 3641 that be saved 4982 5746? And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, 

13:24 Strive 75 5737 to enter in 1525 5629 at 1223 the strait 4728 gate 4439: for 3754 many 4183, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, will seek 2212 5692 to enter in 1525 5629, and 2532 shall 2480 0 not 3756 be able 2480 5692. 

13:25 When once 575 3739 302 the master of the house 3617 is risen up 1453 5686, and 2532 hath shut 608 5661 to the door 2374, and 2532 ye begin 756 5672 to stand 2476 5760 without 1854, and 2532 to knock 2925 5721 at the door 2374, saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962, Lord 2962, open 455 5657 unto us 2254; and 2532 he shall answer 611 5679 and say 2046 5692 unto you 5213, I know 1492 5758 you 5209 not 3756 whence 4159 ye are 2075 5748: 

13:26 Then 5119 shall ye begin 756 5698 to say 3004 5721, We have eaten 5315 5627 and 2532 drunk 4095 5627 in thy 4675 presence 1799, and 2532 thou hast taught 1321 5656 in 1722 our 2257 streets 4113. 

13:27 But 2532 he shall say 2046 5692, I tell 3004 5719 you 5213, I know 1492 5758 you 5209 not 3756 whence 4159 ye are 2075 5748; depart 868 5628 from 575 me 1700, all 3956 [ye] workers 2040 of iniquity 93. 

13:28 There 1563 shall be 2071 5704 weeping 2805 and 2532 gnashing 1030 of teeth 3599, when 3752 ye shall see 3700 5667 Abraham 11, and 2532 Isaac 2464, and 2532 Jacob 2384, and 2532 all 3956 the prophets 4396, in 1722 the kingdom 932 of God 2316, and 1161 you 5209 [yourselves] thrust 1877 5746 out 1854. 

13:29 And 2532 they shall come 2240 5692 from 575 the east 395, and 2532 [from] the west 1424, and 2532 from 575 the north 1005, and 2532 [from] the south 3558, and 2532 shall sit down 347 5701 in 1722 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. 

13:30 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, there are 1526 5748 last 2078 which 3739 shall be 2071 5704 first 4413, and 2532 there are 1526 5748 first 4413 which 3739 shall be 2071 5704 last 2078. 

13:31 The same 1722 846 day 2250 there came 4334 5656 certain 5100 of the Pharisees 5330, saying 3004 5723 unto him 846, Get thee out 1831 5628, and 2532 depart 4198 5737 hence 1782: for 3754 Herod 2264 will 2309 5719 kill 615 5658 thee 4571. 

13:32 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Go ye 4198 5679, and tell 2036 5628 that 5026 fox 258, Behold 2400 5628, I cast out 1544 5719 devils 1140, and 2532 I do 2005 5719 cures 2392 to day 4594 and 2532 to morrow 839, and 2532 the third 5154 [day] I shall be perfected 5048 5743. 

13:33 Nevertheless 4133 I 3165 must 1163 5748 walk 4198 5738 to day 4594, and 2532 to morrow 839, and 2532 the [day] following 2192 5746: for 3754 it cannot be 3756 1735 5736 that a prophet 4396 perish 622 5641 out of 1854 Jerusalem 2419. 

13:34 O Jerusalem 2419, Jerusalem 2419, which 3588 killest 615 5723 the prophets 4396, and 2532 stonest 3036 5723 them that are sent 649 5772 unto 4314 thee 848; how often 4212 would 2309 5656 I have gathered 1996 0 thy 4675 children 5043 together 1996 5658, as 5158 a hen 3733 [doth gather] her 1438 brood 3555 under 5259 [her] wings 4420, and 2532 ye would 2309 5656 not 3756! 

13:35 Behold 2400 5628, your 5216 house 3624 is left 863 5743 unto you 5213 desolate 2048: and 1161 verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, 3754 Ye shall 1492 0 not 3364 see 1492 5632 me 3165, until 2193 302 [the time] come 2240 5661 when 3753 ye shall say 2036 5632, Blessed 2127 5772 [is] he that cometh 2064 5740 in 1722 the name 3686 of the Lord 2962. 

14:1 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, as 1722 he 846 went 2064 5629 into 1519 the house 3624 of one 5100 of the chief 758 Pharisees 5330 to eat 5315 5629 bread 740 on the sabbath 4521 day, that 2532 they watched 2258 5713 3906 5734 him 846. 

14:2 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, there was 2258 5713 a certain 5100 man 444 before 1715 him 846 which had the dropsy 5203. 

14:3 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answering 611 5679 spake 2036 5627 unto 4314 the lawyers 3544 and 2532 Pharisees 5330, saying 3004 5723, Is it 1487 lawful 1832 5748 to heal 2323 5721 on the sabbath day 4521? 

14:4 And 1161 they held their peace 2270 5656. And 2532 he took 1949 5637 [him], and healed 2390 5662 him 846, and 2532 let him go 630 5656; 

14:5 And 2532 answered 611 5679 them 4314 846, saying 2036 5627, Which 5101 of you 5216 shall have an ass 3688 or 2228 an ox 1016 fallen 1706 5695 into 1519 a pit 5421, and 2532 will 385 0 not 3756 straightway 2112 pull 385 0 him 846 out 385 5692 on 1722 the sabbath 4521 day 2250? 

14:6 And 2532 they could 2480 5656 not 3756 answer 470 0 him 846 again 470 5677 to 4314 these things 5023. 

14:7 And 1161 he put forth 3004 5707 a parable 3850 to 4314 those which were bidden 2564 5772, when he marked 1907 5723 how 4459 they chose out 1586 5710 the chief rooms 4411; saying 3004 5723 unto 4314 them 846, 

14:8 When 3752 thou art bidden 2564 5686 of 5259 any 5100 [man] to 1519 a wedding 1062, sit 2625 0 not 3361 down 2625 5686 in 1519 the highest room 4411; lest 3379 a more honourable man 1784 than thou 4675 be 5600 5753 bidden 2564 5772 of 5259 him 846; 

14:9 And 2532 he that bade 2564 5660 thee 4571 and 2532 him come 2064 5631 and say 2046 5692 to thee 4671, Give 1325 5628 this man 5129 place 5117; and 2532 5119 thou begin 756 5672 with 3326 shame 152 to take 2722 5721 the lowest 2078 room 5117. 

14:10 But 235 when 3752 thou art bidden 2564 5686, go 4198 5679 and sit down 377 5657 in 1519 the lowest 2078 room 5117; that 2443 when 3752 he that bade 2564 5761 thee 4571 cometh 2064 5632, he may say 2036 5632 unto thee 4671, Friend 5384, go up 4320 5628 higher 511: then 5119 shalt thou 4671 have 2071 5704 worship 1391 in the presence 1799 of them that sit at meat 4873 5740 with thee 4671. 

14:11 For 3754 whosoever 3956 exalteth 5312 5723 himself 1438 shall be abased 5013 5701; and 2532 he that humbleth 5013 5723 himself 1438 shall be exalted 5312 5701. 

14:12 Then 1161 said he 3004 5707 also 2532 to him that bade 2564 5761 him 846, When 3752 thou makest 4160 5725 a dinner 712 or 2228 a supper 1173, call 5455 5720 not 3361 thy 4675 friends 5384, nor 3366 thy 4675 brethren 80, neither 3366 thy 4675 kinsmen 4773, nor 3366 [thy] rich 4145 neighbours 1069; lest 3379 they 846 also 2532 bid 479 0 thee 4571 again 479 5661, and 2532 a recompence 468 be made 1096 5638 thee 4671. 

14:13 But 235 when 3752 thou makest 4160 5725 a feast 1403, call 2564 5720 the poor 4434, the maimed 376, the lame 5560, the blind 5185: 

14:14 And 2532 thou shalt be 2071 5704 blessed 3107; for 3754 they cannot 3756 2192 5719 recompense 467 5629 thee 4671: for 1063 thou 4671 shalt be recompensed 467 5701 at 1722 the resurrection 386 of the just 1342. 

14:15 And 1161 when one 5100 of them that sat at meat with him 4873 5740 heard 191 5660 these things 5023, he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Blessed 3107 [is] he 3739 that shall eat 5315 5695 bread 740 in 1722 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. 

14:16 Then 1161 said he 2036 5627 unto him 846, A certain 5100 man 444 made 4160 5656 a great 3173 supper 1173, and 2532 bade 2564 5656 many 4183: 

14:17 And 2532 sent 649 5656 his 848 servant 1401 at supper 1173 time 5610 to say 2036 5629 to them that were bidden 2564 5772, Come 2064 5737; for 3754 all things 3956 are 2076 5748 now 2235 ready 2092. 

14:18 And 2532 they all 3956 with 575 one 3391 [consent] began 756 5662 to make excuse 3868 5738. The first 4413 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, I have bought 59 5656 a piece of ground 68, and 2532 I must 2192 5719 needs 318 go 1831 5629 and 2532 see 1492 5629 it 846: I pray 2065 5719 thee 4571 have 2192 5720 me 3165 excused 3868 5772. 

14:19 And 2532 another 2087 said 2036 5627, I have bought 59 5656 five 4002 yoke 2201 of oxen 1016, and 2532 I go 4198 5736 to prove 1381 5658 them 846: I pray 2065 5719 thee 4571 have 2192 5720 me 3165 excused 3868 5772. 

14:20 And 2532 another 2087 said 2036 5627, I have married 1060 5656 a wife 1135, and 2532 therefore 1223 5124 I cannot 3756 1410 5736 come 2064 5629. 

14:21 So 2532 that 1565 servant 1401 came 3854 5637, and shewed 518 5656 his 848 lord 2962 these things 5023. Then 5119 the master of the house 3617 being angry 3710 5685 said 2036 5627 to his 848 servant 1401, Go out 1831 5628 quickly 5030 into 1519 the streets 4113 and 2532 lanes 4505 of the city 4172, and 2532 bring in 1521 5628 hither 5602 the poor 4434, and 2532 the maimed 376, and 2532 the halt 5560, and 2532 the blind 5185. 

14:22 And 2532 the servant 1401 said 2036 5627, Lord 2962, it is done 1096 5754 as 5613 thou hast commanded 2004 5656, and 2532 yet 2089 there is 2076 5748 room 5117. 

14:23 And 2532 the lord 2962 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 the servant 1401, Go out 1831 5628 into 1519 the highways 3598 and 2532 hedges 5418, and 2532 compel 315 5657 [them] to come in 1525 5629, that 2443 my 3450 house 3624 may be filled 1072 5686. 

14:24 For 1063 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 none 3762 of those 1565 men 435 which 3588 were bidden 2564 5772 shall taste 1089 5695 of my 3450 supper 1173. 

14:25 And 1161 there went 4848 5711 great 4183 multitudes 3793 with him 846: and 2532 he turned 4762 5651, and said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, 

14:26 If any 1536 [man] come 2064 5736 to 4314 me 3165, and 2532 hate 3404 5719 not 3756 his 1438 father 3962, and 2532 mother 3384, and 2532 wife 1135, and 2532 children 5043, and 2532 brethren 80, and 2532 sisters 79, yea 2089, and 1161 his own 1438 life 5590 also 2532, he cannot 3756 1410 5736 be 1511 5750 my 3450 disciple 3101. 

14:27 And 2532 whosoever 3748 doth 941 0 not 3756 bear 941 5719 his 848 cross 4716, and 2532 come 2064 5736 after 3694 me 3450, cannot 3756 1410 5736 be 1511 5750 my 3450 disciple 3101. 

14:28 For 1063 which 5101 of 1537 you 5216, intending 2309 5723 to build 3618 5658 a tower 4444, sitteth 2523 0 not 3780 down 2523 5660 first 4412, and counteth 5585 5719 the cost 1160, whether 1487 he have 2192 5719 [sufficient] to 4314 finish 535 [it]? 

14:29 Lest 3363 haply 3379, after he 846 hath laid 5087 5631 the foundation 2310, and 2532 is 2480 0 not 3361 able 2480 5723 to finish 1615 5658 [it], all 3956 that behold 2334 5723 [it] begin 756 5672 to mock 1702 5721 him 846, 

14:30 Saying 3004 5723, This 3754 3778 man 444 began 756 5662 to build 3618 5721, and 2532 was 2480 0 not 3756 able 2480 5656 to finish 1615 5658. 

14:31 Or 2228 what 5101 king 935, going 4198 5740 to make 4820 5629 war 4171 against 1519 another 2087 king 935, sitteth 2523 0 not 3780 down 2523 5660 first 4412, and consulteth 1011 5736 whether 1487 he be 2076 5748 able 1415 with 1722 ten 1176 thousand 5505 to meet 528 5658 him that cometh 2064 5740 against 1909 him 846 with 3326 twenty 1501 thousand 5505? 

14:32 Or else 1490, while the other 846 is 5607 5752 yet 2089 a great way off 4206, he sendeth 649 5660 an ambassage 4242, and desireth 2065 5719 conditions 4314 of peace 1515. 

14:33 So 3779 likewise 3767, whosoever 3956 he be of 1537 you 5216 that 3739 forsaketh 657 5731 not 3756 all 3956 that he hath 5224 5723 1438, he cannot 3756 1410 5736 be 1511 5750 my 3450 disciple 3101. 

14:34 Salt 217 [is] good 2570: but 1161 if 1437 the salt 217 have lost his savour 3471 5686, wherewith 1722 5101 shall it be seasoned 741 5701? 

14:35 It is 2076 5748 neither 3777 fit 2111 for 1519 the land 1093, nor yet 3777 for 1519 the dunghill 2874; [but] men cast 906 5719 it 846 out 1854. He that hath 2192 5723 ears 3775 to hear 191 5721, let him hear 191 5720. 

15:1 Then 1161 drew near 2258 5713 1448 5723 unto him 846 all 3956 the publicans 5057 and 2532 sinners 268 for to hear 191 5721 him 846. 

15:2 And 2532 the Pharisees 5330 and 2532 scribes 1122 murmured 1234 5707, saying 3004 5723, This man 3754 3778 receiveth 4327 5736 sinners 268, and 2532 eateth 4906 5719 with them 846. 

15:3 And 1161 he spake 2036 5627 this 5026 parable 3850 unto 4314 them 846, saying 3004 5723, 

15:4 What 5101 man 444 of 1537 you 5216, having 2192 5723 an hundred 1540 sheep 4263, if 2532 he lose 622 5660 one 1520 of 1537 them 846, doth 2641 0 not 3756 leave 2641 5719 the ninety and nine 1768 in 1722 the wilderness 2048, and 2532 go 4198 5736 after 1909 that which is lost 622 5756, until 2193 he find 2147 5632 it 846? 

15:5 And 2532 when he hath found 2147 5631 [it], he layeth 2007 5719 [it] on 1909 his 1438 shoulders 5606, rejoicing 5463 5723. 

15:6 And 2532 when he cometh 2064 5631 1519 home 3624, he calleth together 4779 5719 [his] friends 5384 and 2532 neighbours 1069, saying 3004 5723 unto them 846, Rejoice 4796 5645 with me 3427; for 3754 I have found 2147 5627 my 3450 sheep 4263 which 3588 was lost 622 5756. 

15:7 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, that 3754 likewise 3779 joy 5479 shall be 2071 5704 in 1722 heaven 3772 over 1909 one 1520 sinner 268 that repenteth 3340 5723, more than 2228 over 1909 ninety and nine 1768 just persons 1342, which 3748 need 2192 5719 5532 no 3756 repentance 3341. 

15:8 Either 2228 what 5101 woman 1135 having 2192 5723 ten 1176 pieces of silver 1406, if 1437 she lose 622 5661 one 3391 piece 1406, doth not 3780 light 681 5719 a candle 3088, and 2532 sweep 4563 5719 the house 3614, and 2532 seek 2212 5719 diligently 1960 till 2193 3755 she find 2147 5632 [it]? 

15:9 And 2532 when she hath found 2147 5631 [it], she calleth 4779 0 [her] friends 5384 and 2532 [her] neighbours 1069 together 4779 5731, saying 3004 5723, Rejoice 4796 5645 with me 3427; for 3754 I have found 2147 5627 the piece 1406 which 3739 I had lost 622 5656. 

15:10 Likewise 3779, I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, there is 1096 5736 joy 5479 in the presence 1799 of the angels 32 of God 2316 over 1909 one 1520 sinner 268 that repenteth 3340 5723. 

15:11 And 1161 he said 2036 5627, A certain 5100 man 444 had 2192 5707 two 1417 sons 5207: 

15:12 And 2532 the younger 3501 of them 846 said 2036 5627 to [his] father 3962, Father 3962, give 1325 5628 me 3427 the portion 3313 of goods 3776 that falleth 1911 5723 [to me]. And 2532 he divided 1244 5627 unto them 846 [his] living 979. 

15:13 And 2532 not 3756 many 4183 days 2250 after 3326 the younger 3501 son 5207 gathered 4863 0 all 537 together 4863 5631, and took his journey 589 5656 into 1519 a far 3117 country 5561, and 2532 there 1563 wasted 1287 5656 his 848 substance 3776 with riotous 811 living 2198 5723. 

15:14 And 1161 when he 846 had spent 1159 5660 all 3956, there arose 1096 5633 a mighty 2478 famine 3042 in 2596 that 1565 land 5561; and 2532 he began 756 5662 to be in want 5302 5745. 

15:15 And 2532 he went 4198 5679 and joined himself 2853 5681 to 1520 a citizen 4177 of that 1565 country 5561; and 2532 he sent 3992 5656 him 846 into 1519 his 848 fields 68 to feed 1006 5721 swine 5519. 

15:16 And 2532 he would fain 1937 5707 have filled 1072 5658 his 848 belly 2836 with 575 the husks 2769 that 3739 the swine 5519 did eat 2068 5707: and 2532 no man 3762 gave 1325 5707 unto him 846. 

15:17 And 1161 when he came 2064 5631 to 1519 himself 1438, he said 2036 5627, How many 4214 hired servants 3407 of my 3450 father's 3962 have bread 740 enough and to spare 4052 5719, and 1161 I 1473 perish 622 5731 with hunger 3042! 

15:18 I will arise 450 5631 and go 4198 5695 to 4314 my 3450 father 3962, and 2532 will say 2046 5692 unto him 846, Father 3962, I have sinned 264 5627 against 1519 heaven 3772, and 2532 before 1799 thee 4675, 

15:19 And 2532 am 1510 5748 no more 3765 worthy 514 to be called 2564 5683 thy 4675 son 5207: make 4160 5657 me 3165 as 5613 one 1520 of thy 4675 hired servants 3407. 

15:20 And 2532 he arose 450 5631, and came 2064 5627 to 4314 his 1438 father 3962. But 1161 when he 846 was yet 2089 a great way 3112 off 568 5723, his 846 father 3962 saw 1492 5627 him 846, and 2532 had compassion 4697 5675, and 2532 ran 5143 5631, and fell 1968 5627 on 1909 his 846 neck 5137, and 2532 kissed 2705 5656 him 846. 

15:21 And 1161 the son 5207 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Father 3962, I have sinned 264 5627 against 1519 heaven 3772, and 2532 in 1799 0 thy 4675 sight 1799, and 2532 am 1510 5748 no more 3765 worthy 514 to be called 2564 5683 thy 4675 son 5207. 

15:22 But 1161 the father 3962 said 2036 5627 to 4314 his 848 servants 1401, Bring forth 1627 5657 the best 4413 robe 4749, and 2532 put [it] on 1746 5657 him 846; and 2532 put 1325 5628 a ring 1146 on 1519 his 846 hand 5495, and 2532 shoes 5266 on 1519 [his] feet 4228: 

15:23 And 2532 bring hither 5342 5660 the fatted 4618 calf 3448, and kill 2380 5657 [it]; and 2532 let us eat 5315 5631, and be merry 2165 5686: 

15:24 For 3754 this 3778 my 3450 son 5207 was 2258 5713 dead 3498, and 2532 is alive again 326 5656; 2532 he was 2258 5713 lost 622 5756, and 2532 is found 2147 5681. And 2532 they began 756 5662 to be merry 2165 5745. 

15:25 Now 1161 his 846 elder 4245 son 5207 was 2258 5713 in 1722 the field 68: and 2532 as 5613 he came 2064 5740 and drew nigh 1448 5656 to the house 3614, he heard 191 5656 musick 4858 and 2532 dancing 5525. 

15:26 And 2532 he called 4341 5666 one 1520 of the servants 3816, and asked 4441 5711 what 5101 these things 5023 meant 1498 5751. 

15:27 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, 3754 Thy 4675 brother 80 is come 2240 5719; and 2532 thy 4675 father 3962 hath killed 2380 5656 the fatted 4618 calf 3448, because 3754 he hath received 618 5627 him 846 safe and sound 5198 5723. 

15:28 And 1161 he was angry 3710 5681, and 2532 would 2309 5707 not 3756 go in 1525 5629: therefore 3767 came 1831 0 his 846 father 3962 out 1831 5631, and intreated 3870 5707 him 846. 

15:29 And 1161 he answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627 to [his] father 3962, Lo 2400 5628, these many 5118 years 2094 do I serve 1398 5719 thee 4671, neither 3763 0 transgressed I 3928 5627 at any time 3763 thy 4675 commandment 1785: and 2532 yet 2532 thou 1325 0 never 3763 gavest 1325 5656 me 1698 a kid 2056, that 2443 I might make merry 2165 5686 with 3326 my 3450 friends 5384: 

15:30 But 1161 as soon as 3753 this 3778 thy 4675 son 5207 was come 2064 5627, which 3588 hath devoured 2719 5631 thy 4675 living 979 with 3326 harlots 4204, thou hast killed 2380 5656 for him 846 the fatted 4618 calf 3448. 

15:31 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Son 5043, thou 4771 art 1488 5748 ever 3842 with 3326 me 1700, and 2532 all 3956 that I have 1699 is 2076 5748 thine 4674. 

15:32 It was 1161 meet 1163 5713 that we should make merry 2165 5683, and 2532 be glad 5463 5646: for 3754 this 3778 thy 4675 brother 80 was 2258 5713 dead 3498, and 2532 is alive again 326 5656; and 2532 was 2258 5713 lost 622 5756, and 2532 is found 2147 5681. 

16:1 And 1161 he said 3004 5707 also 2532 unto 4314 his 848 disciples 3101, There was 2258 5713 a certain 5100 rich 4145 man 444, which 3739 had 2192 5707 a steward 3623; and 2532 the same 3778 was accused 1225 5681 unto him 846 that 5613 he had wasted 1287 5723 his 846 goods 5224 5723. 

16:2 And 2532 he called 5455 5660 him 846, and said 2036 5627 unto him 846, How 5101 is it that I hear 191 5719 this 5124 of 4012 thee 4675? give 591 5628 an account 3056 of thy 4675 stewardship 3622; for 1063 thou mayest be 1410 5695 no 3756 longer 2089 steward 3621 5721. 

16:3 Then 1161 the steward 3623 said 2036 5627 within 1722 himself 1438, What 5101 shall I do 4160 5661? for 3754 my 3450 lord 2962 taketh away 851 5731 from 575 me 1700 the stewardship 3622: I cannot 3756 2480 5719 dig 4626 5721; to beg 1871 5721 I am ashamed 153 5727. 

16:4 I am resolved 1097 5627 what 5101 to do 4160 5692, that 2443, when 3752 I am put out 3179 5686 of the stewardship 3622, they may receive 1209 5667 me 3165 into 1519 their 846 houses 3624. 

16:5 So 2532 he called 4341 5666 every 1538 one 1520 of his 1438 lord's 2962 debtors 5533 [unto him], and said 3004 5707 unto the first 4413, How much 4214 owest thou 3784 5719 unto my 3450 lord 2962? 

16:6 And 1161 he said 2036 5627, An hundred 1540 measures 943 of oil 1637. And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Take 1209 5663 thy 4675 bill 1121, and 2532 sit down 2523 5660 quickly 5030, and write 1125 5657 fifty 4004. 

16:7 Then 1899 said he 2036 5627 to another 2087, And 1161 how much 4214 owest 3784 5719 thou 4771? And 1161 he said 2036 5627, An hundred 1540 measures 2884 of wheat 4621. And 2532 he said 3004 5719 unto him 846, Take 1209 5663 thy 4675 bill 1121, and 2532 write 1125 5657 fourscore 3589. 

16:8 And 2532 the lord 2962 commended 1867 5656 the unjust 93 steward 3623, because 3754 he had done 4160 5656 wisely 5430: for 3754 the children 5207 of this 5127 world 165 are 1526 5748 in 1519 their 1438 generation 1074 wiser 5429 than 5228 the children 5207 of light 5457. 

16:9 And I 2504 say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Make 4160 5657 to yourselves 1438 friends 5384 of 1537 the mammon 3126 of unrighteousness 93; that 2443, when 3752 ye fail 1587 5632, they may receive 1209 5667 you 5209 into 1519 everlasting 166 habitations 4633. 

16:10 He that is faithful 4103 in 1722 that which is least 1646 is 2076 5748 faithful 4103 also 2532 in 1722 much 4183: and 2532 he that is unjust 94 in 1722 the least 1646 is 2076 5748 unjust 94 also 2532 in 1722 much 4183. 

16:11 If 1487 therefore 3767 ye have 1096 0 not 3756 been 1096 5633 faithful 4103 in 1722 the unrighteous 94 mammon 3126, who 5101 will commit 4100 0 to your 5213 trust 4100 5692 the true 228 [riches]? 

16:12 And 2532 if 1487 ye have 1096 0 not 3756 been 1096 5633 faithful 4103 in 1722 that which is another man's 245, who 5101 shall give 1325 5692 you 5213 that which is your own 5212? 

16:13 No 3762 servant 3610 can 1410 5736 serve 1398 5721 two 1417 masters 2962: for 1063 either 2228 he will hate 3404 5692 the one 1520, and 2532 love 25 5692 the other 2087; or else 2228 he will hold 472 5695 to the one 1520, and 2532 despise 2706 5692 the other 2087. Ye cannot 3756 1410 5736 serve 1398 5721 God 2316 and 2532 mammon 3126. 

16:14 And 1161 the Pharisees 5330 also 2532, who were 5225 5723 covetous 5366, heard 191 5707 all 3956 these things 5023: and 2532 they derided 1592 5707 him 846. 

16:15 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Ye 5210 are 2075 5748 they which justify 1344 5723 yourselves 1438 before 1799 men 444; but 1161 God 2316 knoweth 1097 5719 your 5216 hearts 2588: for 3754 that which is highly esteemed 5308 among 1722 men 444 is 2076 5748 abomination 946 in the sight 1799 of God 2316. 

16:16 The law 3551 and 2532 the prophets 4396 [were] until 2193 John 2491: since 575 that time 5119 the kingdom 932 of God 2316 is preached 2097 5743, and 2532 every man 3956 presseth 971 5731 into 1519 it 846. 

16:17 And 1161 it is 2076 5748 easier 2123 for heaven 3772 and 2532 earth 1093 to pass 3928 5629, than 2228 one 3391 tittle 2762 of the law 3551 to fail 4098 5629. 

16:18 Whosoever 3956 putteth away 630 5723 his 848 wife 1135, and 2532 marrieth 1060 5723 another 2087, committeth adultery 3431 5719: and 2532 whosoever 3956 marrieth 1060 5723 her that is put away 630 5772 from 575 [her] husband 435 committeth adultery 3431 5719. 

16:19 1161 There was 2258 5713 a certain 5100 rich 4145 man 444, which 2532 was clothed 1737 5710 in purple 4209 and 2532 fine linen 1040, and fared 2165 5746 sumptuously 2988 every 2596 day 2250: 

16:20 And 1161 there was 2258 5713 a certain 5100 beggar 4434 named 3686 Lazarus 2976, which 3739 was laid 906 5718 at 4314 his 846 gate 4440, full of sores 1669 5772, 

16:21 And 2532 desiring 1937 5723 to be fed 5526 5683 with 575 the crumbs 5589 which 3588 fell 4098 5723 from 575 the rich man's 4145 table 5132: moreover 235 2532 the dogs 2965 came 2064 5740 and licked 621 5707 his 846 sores 1668. 

16:22 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, that the beggar 4434 died 599 5629, and 2532 was carried 667 5683 by 5259 the angels 32 into 1519 Abraham's 11 bosom 2859: the rich man 4145 also 1161 2532 died 599 5627, and 2532 was buried 2290 5648; 

16:23 And 2532 in 1722 hell 86 he lift up 1869 5660 his 848 eyes 3788, being 5225 5723 in 1722 torments 931, and seeth 3708 5719 Abraham 11 afar 3113 off 575, and 2532 Lazarus 2976 in 1722 his 846 bosom 2859. 

16:24 And 2532 he cried 5455 5660 and said 2036 5627, Father 3962 Abraham 11, have mercy 1653 5657 on me 3165, and 2532 send 3992 5657 Lazarus 2976, that 2443 he may dip 911 5661 the tip 206 of his 848 finger 1147 in water 5204, and 2532 cool 2711 5661 my 3450 tongue 1100; for 3754 I am tormented 3600 5743 in 1722 this 5026 flame 5395. 

16:25 But 1161 Abraham 11 said 2036 5627, Son 5043, remember 3415 5682 that 3754 thou 4771 in 1722 thy 4675 lifetime 2222 receivedst 618 5627 thy 4675 good things 18, and 2532 likewise 3668 Lazarus 2976 evil things 2556: but 1161 now 3568 3592 he is comforted 3870 5743, and 1161 thou 4771 art tormented 3600 5743. 

16:26 And 2532 beside 1909 all 3956 this 5125, between 3342 us 2257 and 2532 you 5216 there is 4741 0 a great 3173 gulf 5490 fixed 4741 5769: so that 3704 they which would 2309 5723 pass 1224 5629 from hence 1782 to 4314 you 5209 cannot 3361 1410 5741; neither 3366 can they pass 1276 5725 to 4314 us 2248, that [would come] from thence 1564. 

16:27 Then 1161 he said 2036 5627, I pray 2065 5719 thee 4571 therefore 3767, father 3962, that 2443 thou wouldest send 3992 5661 him 846 to 1519 my 3450 father's 3962 house 3624: 

16:28 For 1063 I have 2192 5719 five 4002 brethren 80; that 3704 he may testify 1263 5741 unto them 846, lest 3363 they 846 also 2532 come 2064 5632 into 1519 this 5126 place 5117 of torment 931. 

16:29 Abraham 11 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, They have 2192 5719 Moses 3475 and 2532 the prophets 4396; let them hear 191 5657 them 846. 

16:30 And 1161 he said 2036 5627, Nay 3780, father 3962 Abraham 11: but 235 if 1437 one 5100 went 4198 5680 unto 4314 them 846 from 575 the dead 3498, they will repent 3340 5692. 

16:31 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, If 1487 they hear 191 5719 not 3756 Moses 3475 and 2532 the prophets 4396, neither 3761 will they be persuaded 3982 5701, though 1437 one 5100 rose 450 5632 from 1537 the dead 3498. 

17:1 Then 1161 said he 2036 5627 unto 4314 the disciples 3101, It is 2076 5748 impossible 418 but 3361 that offences 4625 will come 2064 5629: but 1161 woe 3759 [unto him], through 1223 whom 3739 they come 2064 5736! 

17:2 It were better 3081 5719 for him 846 that 1487 a millstone 3458 3684 were hanged 4029 5736 about 4012 his 846 neck 5137, and 2532 he cast 4496 5769 into 1519 the sea 2281, than 2228 that 2443 he should offend 4624 5661 one 1520 of these 5130 little ones 3398. 

17:3 Take heed 4337 5720 to yourselves 1438: If 1161 1437 thy 4675 brother 80 trespass 264 5632 against 1519 thee 4571, rebuke 2008 5657 him 846; and 2532 if 1437 he repent 3340 5661, forgive 863 5628 him 846. 

17:4 And 2532 if 1437 he trespass 264 5632 against 1519 thee 4571 seven times 2034 in a day 2250, and 2532 seven times 2034 in a day 2250 turn again 1994 5661 to 1909 thee 4571, saying 3004 5723, I repent 3340 5719; thou shalt forgive 863 5692 him 846. 

17:5 And 2532 the apostles 652 said 2036 5627 unto the Lord 2962, Increase 4369 5628 our 2254 faith 4102. 

17:6 And 1161 the Lord 2962 said 2036 5627, If 1487 ye had 2192 5707 faith 4102 as 5613 a grain 2848 of mustard seed 4615, ye might 302 say 3004 5707 unto this 5026 sycamine 4807 tree, Be thou plucked up by the root 1610 5682, and 2532 be thou planted 5452 5682 in 1722 the sea 2281; and 2532 it should 302 obey 5219 5656 you 5213. 

17:7 But 1161 which 5101 of 1537 you 5216, having 2192 5723 a servant 1401 plowing 722 5723 or 2228 feeding cattle 4165 5723, will say 2046 5692 unto him 3739 by and by 2112, when he is come 1525 5631 from 1537 the field 68, Go 3928 5631 and sit down to meat 377 5669? 

17:8 And 235 will not 3780 rather say 2046 5692 unto him 846, Make ready 2090 5657 wherewith 5101 I may sup 1172 5661, and 2532 gird thyself 4024 5671, and serve 1247 5720 me 3427, till 2193 I have eaten 5315 5632 and 2532 drunken 4095 5632; and 2532 afterward 3326 5023 thou 4771 shalt eat 5315 5695 and 2532 drink 4095 5695? 

17:9 3361 Doth he 2192 5719 thank 5485 that 1565 servant 1401 because 3754 he did 4160 5656 the things that were commanded 1299 5685 him 846? I trow 1380 5719 not 3756. 

17:10 So 3779 likewise 2532 ye 5210, when 3752 ye shall have done 4160 5661 all 3956 those things which are commanded 1299 5685 you 5213, say 3004 5720, 3754 We are 2070 5748 unprofitable 888 servants 1401: 3754 we have done 4160 5658 that which 3739 was our duty 3784 5707 to do 4160 5758. 

17:11 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, as 1722 he 846 went 4198 5738 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419, that 2532 he 846 passed 1330 5711 through 1223 the midst 3319 of Samaria 4540 and 2532 Galilee 1056. 

17:12 And 2532 as he 846 entered 1525 5740 into 1519 a certain 5100 village 2968, there met 528 5656 him 846 ten 1176 men 435 that were lepers 3015, which 3739 stood 2476 5627 afar off 4207: 

17:13 And 2532 they 846 lifted up 142 5656 [their] voices 5456, and said 3004 5723, Jesus 2424, Master 1988, have mercy 1653 5657 on us 2248. 

17:14 And 2532 when he saw 1492 5631 [them], he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Go 4198 5679 shew 1925 5657 yourselves 1438 unto the priests 2409. And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, that, as they went 5217 5721 1722, they were cleansed 2511 5681. 

17:15 And 1161 one 1520 of 1537 them 846, when he saw 1492 5631 that 3754 he was healed 2390 5681, turned back 5290 5656, and with 3326 a loud 3173 voice 5456 glorified 1392 5723 God 2316, 

17:16 And 2532 fell down 4098 5627 on 1909 [his] face 4383 at 3844 his 846 feet 4228, giving 2168 0 him 846 thanks 2168 5723: and 2532 he was 2258 5713 a Samaritan 4541. 

17:17 And 1161 Jesus 2424 answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627, Were there 2511 0 not 3780 ten 1176 cleansed 2511 5681? but 1161 where 4226 [are] the nine 1767? 

17:18 There are 2147 0 not 3756 found 2147 5681 that returned 5290 5660 to give 1325 5629 glory 1391 to God 2316, save 1508 this 3778 stranger 241. 

17:19 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Arise 450 5631, go thy way 4198 5737: thy 4675 faith 4102 hath made 4982 0 thee 4571 whole 4982 5758. 

17:20 And 1161 when he was demanded 1905 5685 of 5259 the Pharisees 5330, when 4219 the kingdom 932 of God 2316 should come 2064 5736, he answered 611 5662 them 846 and 2532 said 2036 5627, The kingdom 932 of God 2316 cometh 2064 5736 not 3756 with 3326 observation 3907: 

17:21 Neither 3761 shall they say 2046 5692, Lo 2400 5628 here 5602! or 2228, lo 2400 5628 there 1563! for 1063, behold 2400 5628, the kingdom 932 of God 2316 is 2076 5748 within 1787 you 5216. 

17:22 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 the disciples 3101, The days 2250 will come 2064 5695, when 3753 ye shall desire 1937 5692 to see 1492 5629 one 3391 of the days 2250 of the Son 5207 of man 444, and 2532 ye shall 3700 0 not 3756 see 3700 5695 [it]. 

17:23 And 2532 they shall say 2046 5692 to you 5213, See 2400 5628 here 5602; or 2228, see 2400 5628 there 1563: go 565 0 not 3361 after 565 5632 [them], nor 3366 follow 1377 5661 [them]. 

17:24 For 1063 as 5618 the lightning 796, that lighteneth 797 5723 out of 1537 the one [part] under 5259 heaven 3772, shineth 2989 5719 unto 1519 the other [part] under 5259 heaven 3772; so 3779 shall also 2532 the Son 5207 of man 444 be 2071 5704 in 1722 his 848 day 2250. 

17:25 But 1161 first 4412 must 1163 5748 he 846 suffer 3958 5629 many things 4183, and 2532 be rejected 593 5683 of 575 this 5026 generation 1074. 

17:26 And 2532 as 2531 it was 1096 5633 in 1722 the days 2250 of Noe 3575, so 3779 shall it be 2071 5704 also 2532 in 1722 the days 2250 of the Son 5207 of man 444. 

17:27 They did eat 2068 5707, they drank 4095 5707, they married wives 1060 5707, they were given in marriage 1547 5712, until 891 the day 2250 that 3739 Noe 3575 entered 1525 5627 into 1519 the ark 2787, and 2532 the flood 2627 came 2064 5627, and 2532 destroyed 622 5656 them all 537. 

17:28 Likewise 3668 also 2532 as 5613 it was 1096 5633 in 1722 the days 2250 of Lot 3091; they did eat 2068 5707, they drank 4095 5707, they bought 59 5707, they sold 4453 5707, they planted 5452 5707, they builded 3618 5707; 

17:29 But 1161 the same day 2250 that Lot 3091 went 1831 5627 out of 575 Sodom 4670 it rained 1026 5656 fire 4442 and 2532 brimstone 2303 from 575 heaven 3772, and 2532 destroyed 622 5656 [them] all 537. 

17:30 Even 2596 thus 5024 shall it be 2071 5704 in the day 3739 2250 when the Son 5207 of man 444 is revealed 601 5743. 

17:31 In 1722 that 1565 day 2250, he which 3739 shall be 2071 5704 upon 1909 the housetop 1430, and 2532 his 846 stuff 4632 in 1722 the house 3614, let 2597 0 him not 3361 come down 2597 5628 to take 142 0 it 846 away 142 5658: and 2532 he that is in 1722 the field 68, let him 1994 0 likewise 3668 not 3361 return 1994 5657 back 1519 3694. 

17:32 Remember 3421 5720 Lot's 3091 wife 1135. 

17:33 Whosoever 3739 1437 shall seek 2212 5661 to save 4982 5658 his 848 life 5590 shall lose 622 5692 it 846; and 2532 whosoever 3739 1437 shall lose 622 5661 his 846 life shall preserve 2225 5692 it 846. 

17:34 I tell 3004 5719 you 5213, in that 5026 night 3571 there shall be 2071 5704 two 1417 [men] in 1909 one 3391 bed 2825; the one 1520 shall be taken 3880 5701, and 2532 the other 2087 shall be left 863 5701. 

17:35 Two 1417 [women] shall be 2071 5704 grinding 229 5723 together 846 1909; the one 3391 shall be taken 3880 5701, and 2532 the other 2087 left 863 5701. 

17:36 Two 1417 [men] shall be 2071 5704 in 1722 the field 68; the one 1520 shall be taken 3880 5701, and 2532 the other 2087 left 863 5701. 

17:37 And 2532 they answered 611 5679 and said 3004 5719 unto him 846, Where 4226, Lord 2962? And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Wheresoever 3699 the body 4983 [is], thither 1563 will 4863 0 the eagles 105 be gathered together 4863 5701. 

18:1 And 1161 he spake 3004 5707 2532 a parable 3850 unto them 846 4314 [to this end], that men ought 1163 5750 always 3842 to pray 4336 5738, and 2532 not 3361 to faint 1573 5721; 

18:2 Saying 3004 5723, There was 2258 5713 in 1722 a 5100 city 4172 a 5100 judge 2923, which feared 5399 5740 not 3361 God 2316, neither 2532 3361 regarded 1788 5746 man 444: 

18:3 And 1161 there was 2258 5713 a widow 5503 in 1722 that 1565 city 4172; and 2532 she came 2064 5711 unto 4314 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Avenge 1556 5657 me 3165 of 575 mine 3450 adversary 476. 

18:4 And 2532 he would 2309 5656 not 3756 for 1909 a while 5550: but 1161 afterward 5023 3326 he said 2036 5627 within 1722 himself 1438, Though 1499 2532 I fear 5399 5736 not 3756 God 2316, nor 2532 3756 regard 1788 5743 man 444; 

18:5 Yet 1065 because 1223 this 5026 widow 5503 troubleth 3930 5721 2873 me 3427, I will avenge 1556 5692 her 846, lest 3363 by 1519 her continual 5056 coming 2064 5740 she weary 5299 5725 me 3165. 

18:6 And 1161 the Lord 2962 said 2036 5627, Hear 191 5657 what 5101 the unjust 93 judge 2923 saith 3004 5719. 

18:7 And 1161 shall 1557 0 not 3364 God 2316 avenge 1557 his own 848 elect 1588 4160 5692, which 3588 cry 994 5723 day 2250 and 2532 night 3571 unto 4314 him 846, though 2532 he bear long 3114 5723 with 1909 them 846? 

18:8 I tell 3004 5719 you 5213 that 3754 he will 4160 5692 avenge 1557 them 846 speedily 5034 1722. Nevertheless 4133 when 687 the Son 5207 of man 444 cometh 2064 5631, shall he find 2147 5692 faith 4102 on 1909 the earth 1093? 

18:9 And 1161 he spake 2036 5627 2532 this 5026 parable 3850 unto 4314 certain 5100 which 3588 trusted 3982 5756 in 1909 themselves 1438 that 3754 they were 1526 5748 righteous 1342, and 2532 despised 1848 5723 others 3062: 

18:10 Two 1417 men 444 went up 305 5627 into 1519 the temple 2411 to pray 4336 5664; the one 1520 a Pharisee 5330, and 2532 the other 2087 a publican 5057. 

18:11 The Pharisee 5330 stood 2476 5685 and prayed 4336 5711 thus 5023 with 4314 himself 1438, God 2316, I thank 2168 5719 thee 4671, that 3754 I am 1510 5748 not 3756 as 5618 other 3062 men 444 [are], extortioners 727, unjust 94, adulterers 3432, or 2228 even 2532 as 5613 this 3778 publican 5057. 

18:12 I fast 3522 5719 twice 1364 in the week 4521, I give tithes 586 5719 of all 3956 that 3745 I possess 2932 5736. 

18:13 And 2532 the publican 5057, standing 2476 5761 afar off 3113, would 2309 5707 not 3756 lift up 1869 5658 so much as 3761 [his] eyes 3788 unto 1519 heaven 3772, but 235 smote 5180 5707 upon 1519 his 848 breast 4738, saying 3004 5723, God 2316 be merciful 2433 5682 to me 3427 a sinner 268. 

18:14 I tell 3004 5719 you 5213, this man 3778 went down 2597 5627 to 1519 his 848 house 3624 justified 1344 5772 [rather] than 2228 the other 1565: for 3754 every one 3956 that exalteth 5312 5723 himself 1438 shall be abased 5013 5701; and 1161 he that humbleth 5013 5723 himself 1438 shall be exalted 5312 5701. 

18:15 And 1161 they brought 4374 5707 unto him 846 also 2532 infants 1025, that 2443 he would touch 680 5735 them 846: but 1161 when [his] disciples 3101 saw 1492 5631 [it], they rebuked 2008 5656 them 846. 

18:16 But 1161 Jesus 2424 called 4341 5666 them 846 [unto him], and said 2036 5627, Suffer 863 5628 little children 3813 to come 2064 5738 unto 4314 me 3165, and 2532 forbid 2967 5720 them 846 not 3361: for 1063 of such 5108 is 2076 5748 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. 

18:17 Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Whosoever 3739 shall 1209 0 not 3362 receive 1209 5667 the kingdom 932 of God 2316 as 5613 a little child 3813 shall 1525 0 in no wise 3364 enter 1525 5632 therein 1519 846. 

18:18 And 2532 a certain 5100 ruler 758 asked 1905 5656 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Good 18 Master 1320, what 5101 shall I do 4160 5660 to inherit 2816 5692 5661 eternal 166 life 2222? 

18:19 And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Why 5101 callest thou 3004 5719 me 3165 good 18? none 3762 [is] good 18, save 1508 one 1520, [that is], God 2316. 

18:20 Thou knowest 1492 5758 the commandments 1785, Do 3431 0 not 3361 commit adultery 3431 5661, Do 5407 0 not 3361 kill 5407 5661, Do 2813 0 not 3361 steal 2813 5661, Do 5576 0 not 3361 bear false witness 5576 5661, Honour 5091 5720 thy 4675 father 3962 and 2532 thy 4675 mother 3384. 

18:21 And 1161 he said 2036 5627, All 3956 these 5023 have I kept 5442 5668 from 1537 my 3450 youth 3503 up. 

18:22 Now 1161 when Jesus 2424 heard 191 5660 these things 5023, he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Yet 2089 lackest 3007 5719 thou 4671 one 1520 thing: sell 4453 5657 all 3956 that 3745 thou hast 2192 5719, and 2532 distribute 1239 5628 unto the poor 4434, and 2532 thou shalt have 2192 5692 treasure 2344 in 1722 heaven 3772: and 2532 come 1204 5773, follow 190 5720 me 3427. 

18:23 And 1161 when he heard 191 5660 this 5023, he was 1096 5633 very sorrowful 4036: for 1063 he was 2258 5713 very 4970 rich 4145. 

18:24 And 1161 when Jesus 2424 saw 1492 5631 that he 846 was 1096 5637 very sorrowful 4036, he said 2036 5627, How 4459 hardly 1423 shall they 1525 0 that have 2192 5723 riches 5536 enter 1525 5695 into 1519 the kingdom 932 of God 2316! 

18:25 For 1063 it is 2076 5748 easier 2123 for a camel 2574 to go 1525 5629 through 1223 a needle's 4476 eye 5168, than 2228 for a rich man 4145 to enter 1525 5629 into 1519 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. 

18:26 And 1161 they that heard 191 5660 [it] said 2036 5627, Who 5101 then 2532 can be 1410 5736 saved 4982 5683? 

18:27 And 1161 he said 2036 5627, The things which are impossible 102 with 3844 men 444 are 2076 5748 possible 1415 with 3844 God 2316. 

18:28 Then 1161 Peter 4074 said 2036 5627, Lo 2400 5628, we 2249 have left 863 5656 all 3956, and 2532 followed 190 5656 thee 4671. 

18:29 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, 3754 There is 2076 5748 no man 3762 that 3739 hath left 863 5656 house 3614, or 2228 parents 1118, or 2228 brethren 80, or 2228 wife 1135, or 2228 children 5043, for 1752 0 the kingdom 932 of God's 2316 sake 1752, 

18:30 Who 3739 shall 618 0 not 3364 receive 618 5632 manifold more 4179 in 1722 this 5129 present time 2540, and 2532 in 1722 the world 165 to come 2064 5740 life 2222 everlasting 166. 

18:31 Then 1161 he took 3880 5631 [unto him] the twelve 1427, and said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Behold 2400 5628, we go up 305 5719 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414, and 2532 all things 3956 that are written 1125 5772 by 1223 the prophets 4396 concerning the Son 5207 of man 444 shall be accomplished 5055 5701. 

18:32 For 1063 he shall be delivered 3860 5701 unto the Gentiles 1484, and 2532 shall be mocked 1702 5701, and 2532 spitefully entreated 5195 5701, and 2532 spitted on 1716 5701: 

18:33 And 2532 they shall scourge 3146 5660 [him], and put 615 0 him 846 to death 615 5692: and 2532 the third 5154 day 2250 he shall rise again 450 5698. 

18:34 And 2532 they understood 4920 5656 none 3762 of these things 5130: and 2532 this 5124 saying 4487 was 2258 5713 hid 2928 5772 from 575 them 846, 2532 neither 3756 knew they 1097 5707 the things which were spoken 3004 5746. 

18:35 And 1161 it came to pass 1096 5633, that as 1722 he 846 was come nigh 1448 5721 unto 1519 Jericho 2410, a certain 5100 blind man 5185 sat 2521 5711 by 3844 the way side 3598 begging 4319 5723: 

18:36 And 1161 hearing 191 5660 the multitude 3793 pass by 1279 5740, he asked 4441 5711 what 5101 it 5124 meant 1498 5751. 

18:37 And 1161 they told 518 5656 him 846, that 3754 Jesus 2424 of Nazareth 3480 passeth by 3928 5736. 

18:38 And 2532 he cried 994 5656, saying 3004 5723, Jesus 2424, [thou] Son 5207 of David 1138, have mercy 1653 5657 on me 3165. 

18:39 And 2532 they which went before 4254 5723 rebuked 2008 5707 him 846, that 2443 he should hold his peace 4623 5661: but 1161 he 846 cried 2896 5707 so much 4183 the more 3123, [Thou] Son 5207 of David 1138, have mercy 1653 5657 on me 3165. 

18:40 And 1161 Jesus 2424 stood 2476 5685, and commanded 2753 5656 him 846 to be brought 71 5683 unto 4314 him 848: and 1161 when he was come near 1448 5660, he 846 asked 1905 5656 him 846, 

18:41 Saying 3004 5723, What 5101 wilt thou 2309 5719 that I shall do 4160 5661 unto thee 4671? And 1161 he said 2036 5627, Lord 2962, that 2443 I may receive my sight 308 5661. 

18:42 And 2532 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Receive thy sight 308 5657: thy 4675 faith 4102 hath saved 4982 5758 thee 4571. 

18:43 And 2532 immediately 3916 he received his sight 308 5656, and 2532 followed 190 5707 him 846, glorifying 1392 5723 God 2316: and 2532 all 3956 the people 2992, when they saw 1492 5631 [it], gave 1325 5656 praise 136 unto God 2316. 

19:1 And 2532 [Jesus] entered 1525 5631 and passed through 1330 5711 Jericho 2410. 

19:2 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, [there was] a man 435 named 3686 2564 5746 Zacchaeus 2195, which 2532 846 was 2258 5713 the chief among the publicans 754, and 2532 he 3778 was 2258 5713 rich 4145. 

19:3 And 2532 he sought 2212 5707 to see 1492 5629 Jesus 2424 who 5101 he was 2076 5748; and 2532 could 1410 5711 not 3756 for 575 the press 3793, because 3754 he was 2258 5713 little 3398 of stature 2244. 

19:4 And 2532 he ran 4390 5631 before 1715, and climbed up 305 5627 into 1909 a sycomore tree 4809 to 2443 see 1492 5632 him 846: for 3754 he was 3195 5707 to pass 1330 5738 1223 that 1565 [way]. 

19:5 And 2532 when 5613 Jesus 2424 came 2064 5627 to 1909 the place 5117, he looked up 308 5660, and saw 1492 5627 him 846, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Zacchaeus 2195, make haste 4692 5660, and come down 2597 5628; for 1063 to day 4594 I 3165 must 1163 5748 abide 3306 5658 at 1722 thy 4675 house 3624. 

19:6 And 2532 he made haste 4692 5660, and came down 2597 5627, and 2532 received 5264 5662 him 846 joyfully 5463 5723. 

19:7 And 2532 when they saw 1492 5631 [it], they 1234 0 all 537 murmured 1234 5707, saying 3004 5723, That 3754 he was gone 1525 5627 to be guest 2647 5658 with 3844 a man 435 that is a sinner 268. 

19:8 And 1161 Zacchaeus 2195 stood 2476 5685, and said 2036 5627 unto 4314 the Lord 2962; Behold 2400 5628, Lord 2962, the half 2255 of my 3450 goods 5224 5723 I give 1325 5719 to the poor 4434; and 2532 if 1536 0 I have taken 4811 0 any thing 1536 5100 from any man 5100 by false accusation 4811 5656, I restore 591 5719 [him] fourfold 5073. 

19:9 And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, 3754 This day 4594 is 1096 0 salvation 4991 come 1096 5633 to this 5129 house 3624, forsomuch as 2530 he 846 also 2532 is 2076 5748 a son 5207 of Abraham 11. 

19:10 For 1063 the Son 5207 of man 444 is come 2064 5627 to seek 2212 5658 and 2532 to save 4982 5658 that which was lost 622 5756. 

19:11 And 1161 as they 846 heard 191 5723 these things 5023, he added 4369 5631 and spake 2036 5627 a parable 3850, because 1223 he 846 was 1511 5750 nigh 1451 to Jerusalem 2419, and 2532 because they thought 1380 5721 that 3754 the kingdom 932 of God 2316 should 3195 5719 immediately 3916 appear 398 5745. 

19:12 He said 2036 5627 therefore 3767, A certain 5100 nobleman 444 2104 went 4198 5675 into 1519 a far 3117 country 5561 to receive 2983 5629 for himself 1438 a kingdom 932, and 2532 to return 5290 5658. 

19:13 And 1161 he called 2564 5660 his 1438 ten 1176 servants 1401, and delivered 1325 5656 them 846 ten 1176 pounds 3414, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Occupy 4231 5663 till 2193 I come 2064 5736. 

19:14 But 1161 his 846 citizens 4177 hated 3404 5707 him 846, and 2532 sent 649 5656 a message 4242 after 3694 him 846, saying 3004 5723, We will 2309 0 not 3756 have 2309 5719 this 5126 [man] to reign 936 5658 over 1909 us 2248. 

19:15 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, that when 1722 he 846 was returned 1880 5629, having received 2983 5631 the kingdom 932, then 2532 he commanded 2036 5627 these 5128 servants 1401 to be called 5455 5683 unto him 848, to whom 3739 he had given 1325 5656 the money 694, that 2443 he might know 1097 5632 how much 5101 every man 5101 had gained by trading 1281 5662. 

19:16 Then 1161 came 3854 5633 the first 4413, saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962, thy 4675 pound 3414 hath gained 4333 5662 ten 1176 pounds 3414. 

19:17 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Well 2095, thou good 18 servant 1401: because 3754 thou hast been 1096 5633 faithful 4103 in 1722 a very little 1646, have 2192 5723 thou authority 2468 5749 1849 over 1883 ten 1176 cities 4172. 

19:18 And 2532 the second 1208 came 2064 5627, saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962, thy 4675 pound 3414 hath gained 4160 5656 five 4002 pounds 3414. 

19:19 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 likewise 2532 to him 5129, Be 1096 5737 thou 4771 also 2532 over 1883 five 4002 cities 4172. 

19:20 And 2532 another 2087 came 2064 5627, saying 3004 5723, Lord 2962, behold 2400 5628, [here is] thy 4675 pound 3414, which 3739 I have 2192 5707 kept laid up 606 5740 in 1722 a napkin 4676: 

19:21 For 1063 I feared 5399 5711 thee 4571, because 3754 thou art 1488 5748 an austere 840 man 444: thou takest up 142 5719 that 3739 thou layedst 5087 0 not 3756 down 5087 5656, and 2532 reapest 2325 5719 that 3739 thou didst 4687 0 not 3756 sow 4687 5656. 

19:22 And 1161 he saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Out of 1537 thine own 4675 mouth 4750 will I judge 2919 5692 thee 4571, [thou] wicked 4190 servant 1401. Thou knewest 1492 5715 that 3754 I 1473 was 1510 5748 an austere 840 man 444, taking up 142 5723 that 3739 I laid 5087 0 not 3756 down 5087 5656, and 2532 reaping 2325 5723 that 3739 I did 4687 0 not 3756 sow 4687 5656: 

19:23 Wherefore 1302 then 2532 gavest 1325 0 not 3756 thou 1325 5656 my 3450 money 694 into 1909 the bank 5132, that 2532 at my coming 2064 5631 I 1473 might 302 have required 4238 5656 mine own 846 with 4862 usury 5110? 

19:24 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto them that stood by 3936 5761, Take 142 5657 from 575 him 846 the pound 3414, and 2532 give 1325 5628 [it] to him that hath 2192 5723 ten 1176 pounds 3414. 

19:25 (And 2532 they said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Lord 2962, he hath 2192 5719 ten 1176 pounds 3414) 

19:26 For 1063 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 unto every one 3956 which 3588 hath 2192 5723 shall be given 1325 5701; and 1161 from 575 him that hath 2192 5723 not 3361, even 2532 that 3739 he hath 2192 5719 shall be taken away 142 5701 from 575 him 846. 

19:27 But 4133 those 1565 mine 3450 enemies 2190, which 3588 would 2309 5660 not 3361 that I 3165 should reign 936 5658 over 1909 them 846, bring 71 5628 hither 5602, and 2532 slay 2695 5657 [them] before 1715 me 3450. 

19:28 And 2532 when he had thus 5023 spoken 2036 5631, he went 4198 5711 before 1715, ascending up 305 5723 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414. 

19:29 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, when 5613 he was come nigh 1448 5656 to 1519 Bethphage 967 and 2532 Bethany 963, at 4314 the mount 3735 called 2564 5746 [the mount] of Olives 1636, he sent 649 5656 two 1417 of his 848 disciples 3101, 

19:30 Saying 2036 5631, Go ye 5217 5720 into 1519 the village 2968 over against 2713 [you]; in 1722 the which 3739 at your entering 1531 5740 ye shall find 2147 5692 a colt 4454 tied 1210 5772, whereon 1909 3739 yet never 3762 man 444 sat 2523 5656 4455: loose 3089 5660 him 846, and bring 71 5628 [him hither]. 

19:31 And 2532 if 1437 any man 5100 ask 2065 5725 you 5209, Why 1302 do ye loose 3089 5719 [him]? thus 3779 shall ye say 2046 5692 unto him 846, Because 3754 the Lord 2962 hath 2192 5719 need 5532 of him 846. 

19:32 And 1161 they that were sent 649 5772 went their way 565 5631, and found 2147 5627 even as 2531 he had said 2036 5627 unto them 846. 

19:33 And 1161 as they were loosing 3089 5723 the colt 4454, the owners 2962 thereof 846 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Why 5101 loose ye 3089 5719 the colt 4454? 

19:34 And 1161 they said 2036 5627, The Lord 2962 hath 2192 5719 need 5532 of him 846. 

19:35 And 2532 they brought 71 5627 him 846 to 4314 Jesus 2424: and 2532 they cast 1977 0 their 1438 garments 2440 upon 1909 1977 0 the colt 4454, and 1977 5660 they set 1913 0 Jesus 2424 thereon 1913 5656. 

19:36 And 1161 as he went 4198 5740, they spread 5291 5707 their 848 clothes 2440 in 1722 the way 3598. 

19:37 And when he was come nigh 1448 5723, even 1161 now 2235 at 4314 the descent 2600 of the mount 3735 of Olives 1636, the whole 537 multitude 4128 of the disciples 3101 began 756 5662 to rejoice 5463 5723 and praise 134 5721 God 2316 with a loud 3173 voice 5456 for 4012 all 3956 the mighty works 1411 that 3739 they had seen 1492 5627; 

19:38 Saying 3004 5723, Blessed 2127 5772 [be] the King 935 that cometh 2064 5740 in 1722 the name 3686 of the Lord 2962: peace 1515 in 1722 heaven 3772, and 2532 glory 1391 in 1722 the highest 5310. 

19:39 And 2532 some 5100 of the Pharisees 5330 from 575 among the multitude 3793 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Master 1320, rebuke 2008 5657 thy 4675 disciples 3101. 

19:40 And 2532 he answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto them 846, I tell 3004 5719 you 5213 that 3754, if 1437 these 3778 should hold their peace 4623 5661, the stones 3037 would immediately cry out 2896 5688. 

19:41 And 2532 when 5613 he was come near 1448 5656, he beheld 1492 5631 the city 4172, and wept 2799 5656 over 1909 it 846, 

19:42 Saying 3004 5723, If 3754 1487 thou hadst known 1097 5627, even 2532 thou 4771, 2532 at least 1065 2534 in 1722 this 5026 thy 4675 day 2250, the things 3588 [which belong] unto 4314 thy 4675 peace 1515! but 1161 now 3568 they are hid 2928 5648 from 575 thine 4675 eyes 3788. 

19:43 For 3754 the days 2250 shall come 2240 5692 upon 1909 thee 4571, that 2532 thine 4675 enemies 2190 shall cast 4016 0 a trench 5482 about 4016 5692 thee 4671, and 2532 compass 4033 0 thee 4571 round 4033 5692, and 2532 keep 4912 0 thee 4571 in 4912 5692 on every side 3840, 

19:44 And 2532 shall lay 1474 0 thee 4571 even with the ground 1474 5692, and 2532 thy 4675 children 5043 within 1722 thee 4671; and 2532 they shall 863 0 not 3756 leave 863 5692 in 1722 thee 4671 one stone 3037 upon 1909 another 3037; because 473 3739 thou knewest 1097 5627 not 3756 the time 2540 of thy 4675 visitation 1984. 

19:45 And 2532 he went 1525 5631 into 1519 the temple 2411, and began 756 5662 to cast out 1544 5721 them that sold 4453 5723 therein 1722 846, and 2532 them that bought 59 5723; 

19:46 Saying 3004 5723 unto them 846, It is written 1125 5769, My 3450 house 3624 is 2076 5748 the house 3624 of prayer 4335: but 1161 ye 5210 have made 4160 5656 it 846 a den 4693 of thieves 3027. 

19:47 And 2532 he taught 2258 5713 1321 5723 daily 2596 2250 in 1722 the temple 2411. But 1161 the chief priests 749 and 2532 the scribes 1122 and 2532 the chief 4413 of the people 2992 sought 2212 5707 to destroy 622 5658 him 846, 

19:48 And 2532 could 2147 0 not 3756 find 2147 5707 what 5101 they might do 4160 5661: for 1063 all 537 the people 2992 were very attentive 1582 5710 to hear 191 5723 him 846. 

20:1 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, [that] on 1722 one 3391 of those 1565 days 2250, as he taught 1321 5723 the people 2992 in 1722 the temple 2411, and 2532 preached the gospel 2097 5734, the chief priests 749 and 2532 the scribes 1122 came upon 2186 5627 [him] with 4862 the elders 4245, 

20:2 And 2532 spake 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Tell 2036 5628 us 2254, by 1722 what 4169 authority 1849 doest thou 4160 5719 these things 5023? or 2228 who 5101 is he 2076 5748 that gave 1325 5631 thee 4671 this 5026 authority 1849? 

20:3 And 1161 he answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, I 2504 0 will 2065 0 also 2504 ask 2065 5692 you 5209 one 1520 thing 3056; and 2532 answer 2036 5628 me 3427: 

20:4 The baptism 908 of John 2491, was it 2258 5713 from 1537 heaven 3772, or 2228 of 1537 men 444? 

20:5 And 1161 they reasoned 4817 5662 with 4314 themselves 1438, saying 3004 5723, 3754 If 1437 we shall say 2036 5632, From 1537 heaven 3772; he will say 2046 5692, Why 1302 then 3767 believed ye 4100 5656 him 846 not 3756? 

20:6 But and 1161 if 1437 we say 2036 5632, Of 1537 men 444; all 3956 the people 2992 will stone 2642 5692 us 2248: for 1063 they be 2076 5748 persuaded 3982 5772 that John 2491 was 1511 5750 a prophet 4396. 

20:7 And 2532 they answered 611 5662, that they could 1492 0 not 3361 tell 1492 5760 whence 4159 [it was]. 

20:8 And 2532 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Neither 3761 tell 3004 5719 I 1473 you 5213 by 1722 what 4169 authority 1849 I do 4160 5719 these things 5023. 

20:9 Then 1161 began he 756 5662 to speak 3004 5721 to 4314 the people 2992 this 5026 parable 3850; A certain 5100 man 444 planted 5452 5656 a vineyard 290, and 2532 let 1554 0 it 846 forth 1554 5639 to husbandmen 1092, and 2532 went into a far country 589 5656 for a long 2425 time 5550. 

20:10 And 2532 at 1722 the season 2540 he sent 649 5656 a servant 1401 to 4314 the husbandmen 1092, that 2443 they should give 1325 5632 him 846 of 575 the fruit 2590 of the vineyard 290: but 1161 the husbandmen 1092 beat 1194 5660 him 846, and sent [him] away 1821 5656 empty 2756. 

20:11 And 2532 again 4369 5639 he sent 3992 5658 another 2087 servant 1401: and 1161 they beat 1194 5660 him also 2548, and 2532 entreated [him] shamefully 818 5660, and sent [him] away 1821 5656 empty 2756. 

20:12 And 2532 again 4369 5639 he sent 3992 5658 a third 5154: and 1161 they wounded 5135 5660 him 5126 also 2532, and cast [him] out 1544 5627. 

20:13 Then 1161 said 2036 5627 the lord 2962 of the vineyard 290, What 5101 shall I do 4160 5661? I will send 3992 5692 my 3450 beloved 27 son 5207: it may be 2481 they will reverence 1788 5691 [him] when they see 1492 5631 him 5126. 

20:14 But 1161 when the husbandmen 1092 saw 1492 5631 him 846, they reasoned 1260 5711 among 4314 themselves 1438, saying 3004 5723, This 3778 is 2076 5748 the heir 2818: come 1205 5773, let us kill 615 5725 him 846, that 2443 the inheritance 2817 may be 1096 5638 ours 2257. 

20:15 So 2532 they cast 1544 5631 him 846 out of 1854 the vineyard 290, and killed 615 5656 [him]. What 5101 therefore 3767 shall 4160 0 the lord 2962 of the vineyard 290 do 4160 5692 unto them 846? 

20:16 He shall come 2064 5695 and 2532 destroy 622 5692 these 5128 husbandmen 1092, and 2532 shall give 1325 5692 the vineyard 290 to others 243. And 1161 when they heard 191 5660 [it], they said 2036 5627, God forbid 3361 1096 5636. 

20:17 And 1161 he beheld 1689 5660 them 846, and said 2036 5627, What 5101 is 2076 5748 this 5124 then 3767 that is written 1125 5772, The stone 3037 which 3739 the builders 3618 5723 rejected 593 5656, the same 3778 is become 1096 5675 the head 2776 of 1519 the corner 1137? 

20:18 Whosoever 3956 shall fall 4098 5631 upon 1909 that 1565 stone 3037 shall be broken 4917 5701; but 1161 on 1909 whomsoever 3739 302 it shall fall 4098 5632, it will grind 3039 0 him 846 to powder 3039 5692. 

20:19 And 2532 the chief priests 749 and 2532 the scribes 1122 the same 1722 846 hour 5610 sought 2212 5656 to lay 1911 5629 hands 5495 on 1909 him 846; and 2532 they feared 5399 5675 the people 2992: for 1063 they perceived 1097 5627 that 3754 he had spoken 2036 5627 this 5026 parable 3850 against 4314 them 846. 

20:20 And 2532 they watched 3906 5660 [him], and sent forth 649 5656 spies 1455, which should feign 5271 5740 1511 5750 themselves 1438 just men 1342, that 2443 they might take hold 1949 5638 of his 846 words 3056, that so 1519 they might deliver 3860 5629 him 846 unto the power 746 and 2532 authority 1849 of the governor 2232. 

20:21 And 2532 they asked 1905 5656 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Master 1320, we know 1492 5758 that 3754 thou sayest 3004 5719 and 2532 teachest 1321 5719 rightly 3723, 2532 neither 3756 acceptest thou 2983 5719 the person 4383 [of any], but 235 teachest 1321 5719 the way 3598 of God 2316 truly 225 1909: 

20:22 Is it lawful 1832 5748 for us 2254 to give 1325 5629 tribute 5411 unto Caesar 2541, or 2228 no 3756? 

20:23 But 1161 he perceived 2657 5660 their 846 craftiness 3834, and said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Why 5101 tempt ye 3985 5719 me 3165? 

20:24 Shew 1925 5657 me 3427 a penny 1220. Whose 5101 image 1504 and 2532 superscription 1923 hath it 2192 5719? They answered 611 5679 and 1161 said 2036 5627, Caesar's 2541. 

20:25 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Render 591 5628 therefore 5106 unto Caesar 2541 the things which be 3588 Caesar's 2541, and 2532 unto God 2316 the things which be 3588 God's 2316. 

20:26 And 2532 they could 2480 5656 not 3756 take hold 1949 5635 of his 846 words 4487 before 1726 the people 2992: and 2532 they marvelled 2296 5660 at 1909 his 846 answer 612, and held their peace 4601 5656. 

20:27 Then 1161 came 4334 5631 to [him] certain 5100 of the Sadducees 4523, which 3588 deny 483 5723 that there is 1511 5750 any 3361 resurrection 386; and they asked 1905 5656 him 846, 

20:28 Saying 3004 5723, Master 1320, Moses 3475 wrote 1125 5656 unto us 2254, If 1437 any man's 5100 brother 80 die 599 5632, having 2192 5723 a wife 1135, and 2532 he 3778 die 599 5632 without children 815, that 2443 his 846 brother 80 should take 2983 5632 his wife 1135, and 2532 raise up 1817 5661 seed 4690 unto his 848 brother 80. 

20:29 There were 2258 5713 therefore 3767 seven 2033 brethren 80: and 2532 the first 4413 took 2983 5631 a wife 1135, and died 599 5627 without children 815. 

20:30 And 2532 the second 1208 took 2983 5627 her to wife 1135, and 2532 he 3778 died 599 5627 childless 815. 

20:31 And 2532 the third 5154 took 2983 5627 her 846; and 1161 in like manner 5615 the seven 2033 also 2532: and they left 2641 5627 no 3756 children 5043, and 2532 died 599 5627. 

20:32 1161 Last 5305 of all 3956 the woman 1135 died 599 5627 also 2532. 

20:33 Therefore 3767 in 1722 the resurrection 386 whose 5101 wife 1135 of them 846 is she 1096 5736? for 1063 seven 2033 had 2192 5627 her 846 to wife 1135. 

20:34 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, The children 5207 of this 5127 world 165 marry 1060 5719, and 2532 are given in marriage 1548 5743: 

20:35 But 1161 they which shall be accounted worthy 2661 5685 to obtain 5177 5629 that 1565 world 165, and 2532 the resurrection 386 from 1537 the dead 3498, neither 3777 marry 1060 5719, nor 3777 are given in marriage 1548 5743: 

20:36 Neither 3777 1063 can 1410 5736 they die 599 5629 any more 2089: for 1063 they are 1526 5748 equal unto the angels 2465; and 2532 are 1526 5748 the children 5207 of God 2316, being 5607 5752 the children 5207 of the resurrection 386. 

20:37 Now 1161 that 3754 the dead 3498 are raised 1453 5743, even 2532 Moses 3475 shewed 3377 5656 at 1909 the bush 942, when 5613 he calleth 3004 5719 the Lord 2962 the God 2316 of Abraham 11, and 2532 the God 2316 of Isaac 2464, and 2532 the God 2316 of Jacob 2384. 

20:38 For 1161 he is 2076 5748 not 3756 a God 2316 of the dead 3498, but 235 of the living 2198 5723: for 1063 all 3956 live 2198 5719 unto him 846. 

20:39 Then 1161 certain 5100 of the scribes 1122 answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627, Master 1320, thou hast well 2573 said 2036 5627. 

20:40 And 1161 after that 3765 0 2089 they durst 5111 5707 not 3765 ask 1905 5721 him 846 any 3762 [question at all]. 

20:41 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, How 4459 say 3004 5719 they that Christ 5547 is 1511 5750 David's 1138 son 5207? 

20:42 And 2532 David 1138 himself 846 saith 3004 5719 in 1722 the book 976 of Psalms 5568, The LORD 2962 said 2036 5627 unto my 3450 Lord 2962, Sit thou 2521 5737 on 1537 my 3450 right hand 1188, 

20:43 Till 2193 302 I make 5087 5632 thine 4675 enemies 2190 thy 4675 footstool 4228 5286. 

20:44 David 1138 therefore 3767 calleth 2564 5719 him 846 Lord 2962, how 4459 is he 2076 5748 then 2532 his 846 son 5207? 

20:45 Then 1161 in the audience 191 5723 of all 3956 the people 2992 he said 2036 5627 unto his 848 disciples 3101, 

20:46 Beware 4337 5720 of 575 the scribes 1122, which 3588 desire 2309 5723 to walk 4043 5721 in 1722 long robes 4749, and 2532 love 5368 5723 greetings 783 in 1722 the markets 58, and 2532 the highest seats 4410 in 1722 the synagogues 4864, and 2532 the chief rooms 4411 at 1722 feasts 1173; 

20:47 Which 3739 devour 2719 5719 widows 5503' houses 3614, and 2532 for a shew 4392 make 4336 0 long 3117 prayers 4336 5736: the same 3778 shall receive 2983 5695 greater 4055 damnation 2917. 

21:1 And 1161 he looked up 308 5660, and saw 1492 5627 the rich men 4145 casting 906 5723 their 848 gifts 1435 into 1519 the treasury 1049. 

21:2 And 1161 he saw 1492 5627 also 2532 a certain 5100 poor 3998 widow 5503 casting 906 5723 in thither 1563 two 1417 mites 3016. 

21:3 And 2532 he said 2036 5627, Of a truth 230 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, that 3754 this 3778 poor 4434 widow 5503 hath cast 906 5627 in more than 4119 they all 3956: 

21:4 For 1063 all 537 these 3778 have of 1537 their 846 abundance 4052 5723 cast 906 5627 in unto 1519 the offerings 1435 of God 2316: but 1161 she 3778 of 1537 her 848 penury 5303 hath cast 906 5627 in all 537 the living 979 that 3739 she had 2192 5707. 

21:5 And 2532 as some 5100 spake 3004 5723 of 4012 the temple 2411, how 3754 it was adorned 2885 5769 with goodly 2570 stones 3037 and 2532 gifts 334, he said 2036 5627, 

21:6 [As for] these things 5023 which 3739 ye behold 2334 5719, the days 2250 will come 2064 5695, in 1722 the which 3739 there shall 863 0 not 3756 be left 863 5701 one stone 3037 upon 1909 another 3037, that 3739 shall 2647 0 not 3756 be thrown down 2647 5701. 

21:7 And 1161 they asked 1905 5656 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Master 1320, but 3767 when 4219 shall 2071 0 these things 5023 be 2071 5704? and 2532 what 5101 sign 4592 [will there be] when 3752 these things 5023 shall 3195 5725 come to pass 1096 5738? 

21:8 And 1161 he said 2036 5627, Take heed 991 5720 that ye be 4105 0 not 3361 deceived 4105 5686: for 1063 many 4183 shall come 2064 5695 in 1909 my 3450 name 3686, saying 3004 5723, 3754 I 1473 am 1510 5748 [Christ]; and 2532 the time 2540 draweth near 1448 5758: go ye 4198 5680 not 3361 therefore 3767 after 3694 them 846. 

21:9 But 1161 when 3752 ye shall hear 191 5661 of wars 4171 and 2532 commotions 181, be 4422 0 not 3361 terrified 4422 5686: for 1063 these things 5023 must 1163 5748 first 4412 come to pass 1096 5635; but 235 the end 5056 [is] not 3756 by and by 2112. 

21:10 Then 5119 said he 3004 5707 unto them 846, Nation 1484 shall rise 1453 5701 against 1909 nation 1484, and 2532 kingdom 932 against 1909 kingdom 932: 

21:11 And 5037 great 3173 earthquakes 4578 shall be 2071 5704 in 2596 divers places 5117, and 2532 famines 3042, and 2532 pestilences 3061; and 5037 fearful sights 5400 and 2532 great 3173 signs 4592 shall there be 2071 5704 from 575 heaven 3772. 

21:12 But 1161 before 4253 all 537 these 5130, they shall lay 1911 5692 their 848 hands 5495 on 1909 you 5209, and 2532 persecute 1377 5692 [you], delivering 3860 5723 [you] up 1519 to the synagogues 4864, and 2532 into prisons 5438, being brought 71 5746 before 1909 kings 935 and 2532 rulers 2232 for 1752 0 my 3450 name's 3686 sake 1752. 

21:13 And 1161 it shall turn 576 5695 to you 5213 for 1519 a testimony 3142. 

21:14 Settle 5087 5640 [it] therefore 3767 in 1519 your 5216 hearts 2588, not 3361 to meditate before 4304 5721 what ye shall answer 626 5677: 

21:15 For 1063 I 1473 will give 1325 5692 you 5213 a mouth 4750 and 2532 wisdom 4678, which 3739 all 3956 your 5213 adversaries 480 5740 shall 1410 0 not 3756 be able 1410 5695 to gainsay 471 5629 nor 3761 resist 436 5629. 

21:16 And 1161 ye shall be betrayed 3860 5701 both 2532 by 5259 parents 1118, and 2532 brethren 80, and 2532 kinsfolks 4773, and 2532 friends 5384; and 2532 [some] of 1537 you 5216 shall they cause to be put to death 2289 5692. 

21:17 And 2532 ye shall be 2071 5704 hated 3404 5746 of 5259 all 3956 [men] for 1223 my 3450 name's sake 3686. 

21:18 But 2532 there shall not 3364 an hair 2359 of 1537 your 5216 head 2776 perish 622 5643. 

21:19 In 1722 your 5216 patience 5281 possess ye 2932 5663 your 5216 souls 5590. 

21:20 And 1161 when 3752 ye shall see 1492 5632 Jerusalem 2419 compassed 2944 5746 with 5259 armies 4760, then 5119 know 1097 5628 that 3754 the desolation 2050 thereof 846 is nigh 1448 5758. 

21:21 Then 5119 let them 5343 0 which are in 1722 Judaea 2449 flee 5343 5720 to 1519 the mountains 3735; and 2532 let them 1633 0 which are in 1722 the midst 3319 of it 846 depart out 1633 5720; and 2532 let 1525 0 not 3361 them that are in 1722 the countries 5561 enter 1525 5737 thereinto 1519 846. 

21:22 For 3754 these 3778 be 1526 5748 the days 2250 of vengeance 1557, that all things 3956 which 3588 are written 1125 5772 may be fulfilled 4137 5683. 

21:23 But 1161 woe 3759 unto 1722 them that are with child 1064 2192 5723, and 2532 to them that give suck 2337 5723, in 1722 those 1565 days 2250! for 1063 there shall be 2071 5704 great 3173 distress 318 in 1909 the land 1093, and 2532 wrath 3709 upon 1722 this 5129 people 2992. 

21:24 And 2532 they shall fall 4098 5699 by the edge 4750 of the sword 3162, and 2532 shall be led away captive 163 5701 into 1519 all 3956 nations 1484: and 2532 Jerusalem 2419 shall be 2071 5704 trodden down 3961 5746 of 5259 the Gentiles 1484, until 891 the times 2540 of the Gentiles 1484 be fulfilled 4137 5686. 

21:25 And 2532 there shall be 2071 5704 signs 4592 in 1722 the sun 2246, and 2532 in the moon 4582, and 2532 in the stars 798; and 2532 upon 1909 the earth 1093 distress 4928 of nations 1484, with 1722 perplexity 640; the sea 2281 and 2532 the waves 4535 roaring 2278 5723; 

21:26 Men's 444 hearts failing them 674 5723 for 575 fear 5401, and 2532 for looking after 4329 those things which are coming on 1904 5740 the earth 3625: for 1063 the powers 1411 of heaven 3772 shall be shaken 4531 5701. 

21:27 And 2532 then 5119 shall they see 3700 5695 the Son 5207 of man 444 coming 2064 5740 in 1722 a cloud 3507 with 3326 power 1411 and 2532 great 4183 glory 1391. 

21:28 And 1161 when these things 5130 begin 756 5734 to come to pass 1096 5738, then look up 352 5657, and 2532 lift up 1869 5657 your 5216 heads 2776; for 1360 your 5216 redemption 629 draweth nigh 1448 5719. 

21:29 And 2532 he spake 2036 5627 to them 846 a parable 3850; Behold 1492 5628 the fig tree 4808, and 2532 all 3956 the trees 1186; 

21:30 When 3752 they now 2235 shoot forth 4261 5632, ye see 991 5723 and know 1097 5719 of 575 your own selves 1438 that 3754 summer 2330 is 2076 5748 now 2235 nigh at hand 1451. 

21:31 So 3779 likewise 2532 ye 5210, when 3752 ye see 1492 5632 these things 5023 come to pass 1096 5740, know ye 1097 5720 that 3754 the kingdom 932 of God 2316 is 2076 5748 nigh at hand 1451. 

21:32 Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, 3754 This 3778 generation 1074 shall 3928 0 not 3364 pass away 3928 5632, 302 till 2193 all 3956 be fulfilled 1096 5638. 

21:33 Heaven 3772 and 2532 earth 1093 shall pass away 3928 5695: but 1161 my 3450 words 3056 shall 3928 0 not 3364 pass away 3928 5632. 

21:34 And 1161 take heed 4337 5720 to yourselves 1438, lest at any time 3379 your 5216 hearts 2588 be overcharged 925 5686 with 1722 surfeiting 2897, and 2532 drunkenness 3178, and 2532 cares 3308 of this life 982, and 2532 [so] that 1565 day 2250 come 2186 5632 upon 1909 you 5209 unawares 160. 

21:35 For 1063 as 5613 a snare 3803 shall it come 1904 5695 on 1909 all 3956 them that dwell 2521 5740 on 1909 the face 4383 of the whole 3956 earth 1093. 

21:36 Watch ye 69 5720 therefore 3767, and pray 1189 5740 always 1722 3956 2540, that 2443 ye may be accounted worthy 2661 5686 to escape 1628 5629 all 3956 these things 5023 that shall 3195 5723 come to pass 1096 5738, and 2532 to stand 2476 5683 before 1715 the Son 5207 of man 444. 

21:37 And 1161 in the day time 2250 he was 2258 5713 teaching 1321 5723 in 1722 the temple 2411; and 1161 at night 3571 he went out 1831 5740, and abode 835 5711 in 1519 the mount 3735 that is called 2564 5746 [the mount] of Olives 1636. 

21:38 And 2532 all 3956 the people 2992 came early in the morning 3719 5707 to 4314 him 846 in 1722 the temple 2411, for to hear 191 5721 him 846. 

22:1 Now 1161 the feast 1859 of unleavened bread 106 drew nigh 1448 5707, which is called 3004 5746 the Passover 3957. 

22:2 And 2532 the chief priests 749 and 2532 scribes 1122 sought 2212 5707 how 4459 they might kill 337 5661 him 846; for 1063 they feared 5399 5711 the people 2992. 

22:3 Then 1161 entered 1525 5627 Satan 4567 into 1519 Judas 2455 surnamed 1941 5746 Iscariot 2469, being 5607 5752 of 1537 the number 706 of the twelve 1427. 

22:4 And 2532 he went his way 565 5631, and communed with 4814 5656 the chief priests 749 and 2532 captains 4755, how 4459 he might betray 3860 5632 him 846 unto them 846. 

22:5 And 2532 they were glad 5463 5644, and 2532 covenanted 4934 5639 to give 1325 5629 him 846 money 694. 

22:6 And 2532 he promised 1843 5656, and 2532 sought 2212 5707 opportunity 2120 to betray 3860 5629 him 846 unto them 846 in the absence 817 of the multitude 3793. 

22:7 Then 1161 came 2064 5627 the day 2250 of unleavened bread 106, when 1722 3739 the passover 3957 must 1163 5713 be killed 2380 5745. 

22:8 And 2532 he sent 649 5656 Peter 4074 and 2532 John 2491, saying 2036 5631, Go 4198 5679 and prepare 2090 5657 us 2254 the passover 3957, that 2443 we may eat 5315 5632. 

22:9 And 1161 they said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Where 4226 wilt thou 2309 5719 that we prepare 2090 5661? 

22:10 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Behold 2400 5628, when ye 5216 are entered 1525 5631 into 1519 the city 4172, there shall 4876 0 a man 444 meet 4876 5692 you 5213, bearing 941 5723 a pitcher 2765 of water 5204; follow 190 5657 him 846 into 1519 the house 3614 where 3757 he entereth in 1531 5736. 

22:11 And 2532 ye shall say 2046 5692 unto the goodman 3617 of the house 3614, The Master 1320 saith 3004 5719 unto thee 4671, Where 4226 is 2076 5748 the guestchamber 2646, where 3699 I shall eat 5315 5632 the passover 3957 with 3326 my 3450 disciples 3101? 

22:12 And 2548 he shall shew 1166 5692 you 5213 a large 3173 upper room 508 furnished 4766 5772: there 1563 make ready 2090 5657. 

22:13 And 1161 they went 565 5631, and found 2147 5627 as 2531 he had said 2046 5758 unto them 846: and 2532 they made ready 2090 5656 the passover 3957. 

22:14 And 2532 when 3753 the hour 5610 was come 1096 5633, he sat down 377 5627, and 2532 the twelve 1427 apostles 652 with 4862 him 846. 

22:15 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, With desire 1939 I have desired 1937 5656 to eat 5315 5629 this 5124 passover 3957 with 3326 you 5216 before 4253 I 3165 suffer 3958 5629: 

22:16 For 1063 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, 3754 I will 5315 0 not 3765 any more 3364 eat 5315 5632 thereof 846 1537, until 2193 3755 it be fulfilled 4137 5686 in 1722 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. 

22:17 And 2532 he took 1209 5666 the cup 4221, and gave thanks 2168 5660, and said 2036 5627, Take 2983 5628 this 5124, and 2532 divide 1266 5657 [it] among yourselves 1438: 

22:18 For 1063 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, 3754 I will 4095 0 not 3364 drink 4095 5632 of 575 the fruit 1081 of the vine 288, until 2193 3755 the kingdom 932 of God 2316 shall come 2064 5632. 

22:19 And 2532 he took 2983 5631 bread 740, and gave thanks 2168 5660, and brake 2806 5656 [it], and 2532 gave 1325 5656 unto them 846, saying 3004 5723, This 5124 is 2076 5748 my 3450 body 4983 which 3588 is given 1325 5746 for 5228 you 5216: this 5124 do 4160 5720 in remembrance 364 of 1519 me 1699. 

22:20 Likewise 5615 also 2532 the cup 4221 after 3326 supper 1172 5658, saying 3004 5723, This 5124 cup 4221 [is] the new 2537 testament 1242 in 1722 my 3450 blood 129, which 3588 is shed 1632 5746 for 5228 you 5216. 

22:21 But 4133, behold 2400 5628, the hand 5495 of him that betrayeth 3860 5723 me 3165 [is] with 3326 me 1700 on 1909 the table 5132. 

22:22 And 2532 truly 3303 the Son 5207 of man 444 goeth 4198 5736, as 2596 it was determined 3724 5772: but 4133 woe 3759 unto that 1565 man 444 by 1223 whom 3739 he is betrayed 3860 5743! 

22:23 And 2532 they 846 began 756 5662 to enquire 4802 5721 among 4314 themselves 1438, which 5101 686 of 1537 them 846 it was 1498 5751 that should 3195 5723 do 4238 5721 this thing 5124. 

22:24 And 1161 there was 1096 5633 also 2532 a strife 5379 among 1722 them 846, which 5101 of them 846 should be accounted 1380 5719 1511 5750 the greatest 3187. 

22:25 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, The kings 935 of the Gentiles 1484 exercise lordship over 2961 5719 them 846; and 2532 they that exercise authority upon 1850 5723 them 846 are called 2564 5743 benefactors 2110. 

22:26 But 1161 ye 5210 [shall] not 3756 [be] so 3779: but 235 he that is greatest 3187 among 1722 you 5213, let him be 1096 5634 as 5613 the younger 3501; and 2532 he that is chief 2233 5740, as 5613 he that doth serve 1247 5723. 

22:27 For 1063 whether 5101 [is] greater 3187, he that sitteth at meat 345 5740, or 2228 he that serveth 1247 5723? [is] not 3780 he that sitteth at meat 345 5740? but 1161 I 1473 am 1510 5748 among 1722 3319 you 5216 as 5613 he that serveth 1247 5723. 

22:28 1161 Ye 5210 are 2075 5748 they which have continued 1265 5761 with 3326 me 1700 in 1722 my 3450 temptations 3986. 

22:29 And I 2504 appoint 1303 5731 unto you 5213 a kingdom 932, as 2531 my 3450 Father 3962 hath appointed 1303 5639 unto me 3427; 

22:30 That 2443 ye may eat 2068 5725 and 2532 drink 4095 5725 at 1909 my 3450 table 5132 in 1722 my 3450 kingdom 932, and 2532 sit 2523 5667 on 1909 thrones 2362 judging 2919 5723 the twelve 1427 tribes 5443 of Israel 2474. 

22:31 And 1161 the Lord 2962 said 2036 5627, Simon 4613, Simon 4613, behold 2400 5628, Satan 4567 hath desired 1809 5668 [to have] you 5209, that he may sift 4617 5658 [you] as 5613 wheat 4621: 

22:32 But 1161 I 1473 have prayed 1189 5681 for 4012 thee 4675, that 3363 0 thy 4675 faith 4102 fail 1587 5725 not 3363: and 2532 when 4218 thou 4771 art converted 1994 5660, strengthen 4741 5657 thy 4675 brethren 80. 

22:33 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Lord 2962, I am 1510 5748 ready 2092 to go 4198 5738 with 3326 thee 4675, both 2532 into 1519 prison 5438, and 2532 to 1519 death 2288. 

22:34 And 1161 he said 2036 5627, I tell 3004 5719 thee 4671, Peter 4074, the cock 220 shall 5455 0 not 3364 crow 5455 5692 this day 4594, before that 4250 thou shalt 2228 thrice 5151 deny 533 5695 that thou 3361 knowest 1492 5760 me 3165. 

22:35 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, When 3753 I sent 649 5656 you 5209 without 817 purse 905, and 2532 scrip 4082, and 2532 shoes 5266, 3361 lacked ye 5302 5656 any thing 5100? And 1161 they said 2036 5627, Nothing 3762. 

22:36 Then 3767 said he 2036 5627 unto them 846, But 235 now 3568, he that hath 2192 5723 a purse 905, let him take 142 5657 [it], and 2532 likewise 3668 [his] scrip 4082: and 2532 he that hath 2192 5723 no 3361 sword 3162, let him sell 4453 5657 his 848 garment 2440, and 2532 buy 59 5692 one. 

22:37 For 1063 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, that 3754 this 5124 that is written 1125 5772 must 1163 5748 yet 2089 be accomplished 5055 5683 in 1722 me 1698, And 2532 he was reckoned 3049 5681 among 3326 the transgressors 459: for 2532 1063 the things concerning 4012 me 1700 have 2192 5719 an end 5056. 

22:38 And 1161 they said 2036 5627, Lord 2962, behold 2400 5628, here 5602 [are] two 1417 swords 3162. And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, It is 2076 5748 enough 2425. 

22:39 And 2532 he came out 1831 5631, and went 4198 5675, as 2596 he was wont 1485, to 1519 the mount 3735 of Olives 1636; and 1161 his 846 disciples 3101 also 2532 followed 190 5656 him 846. 

22:40 And 1161 when he was 1096 5637 at 1909 the place 5117, he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Pray 4336 5737 that ye enter 1525 5629 not 3361 into 1519 temptation 3986. 

22:41 And 2532 he 846 was withdrawn 645 5681 from 575 them 846 about 5616 a stone's 3037 cast 1000, and 2532 kneeled down 5087 5631 1119, and prayed 4336 5711, 

22:42 Saying 3004 5723, Father 3962, if 1487 thou be willing 1014 5736, remove 3911 5629 5625 3911 5628 this 5124 cup 4221 from 575 me 1700: nevertheless 4133 not 3361 my 3450 will 2307, but 235 thine 4674, be done 1096 5634. 

22:43 And 1161 there appeared 3700 5681 an angel 32 unto him 846 from 575 heaven 3772, strengthening 1765 5723 him 846. 

22:44 And 2532 being 1096 5637 in 1722 an agony 74 he prayed 4336 5711 more earnestly 1617: and 1161 his 846 sweat 2402 was 1096 5633 as it were 5616 great drops 2361 of blood 129 falling down 2597 5723 to 1909 the ground 1093. 

22:45 And 2532 when he rose up 450 5631 from 575 prayer 4335, and was come 2064 5631 to 4314 his 846 disciples 3101, he found 2147 5627 them 846 sleeping 2837 5746 for 575 sorrow 3077, 

22:46 And 2532 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Why 5101 sleep ye 2518 5719? rise 450 5631 and pray 4336 5737, lest 3363 ye enter 1525 5632 into 1519 temptation 3986. 

22:47 And 1161 while he yet 2089 spake 2980 5723, behold 2400 5628 a multitude 3793, and 2532 he that was called 3004 5746 Judas 2455, one 1520 of the twelve 1427, went before 4281 5711 them 846, and 2532 drew near 1448 5656 unto Jesus 2424 to kiss 5368 5658 him 846. 

22:48 But 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Judas 2455, betrayest thou 3860 5719 the Son 5207 of man 444 with a kiss 5370? 

22:49 When 1161 they which were about 4012 him 846 saw 1492 5631 what would follow 2071 5706, they said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Lord 2962, 1487 shall we smite 3960 5692 with 1722 the sword 3162? 

22:50 And 2532 one 1520 5100 of 1537 them 846 smote 3960 5656 the servant 1401 of the high priest 749, and 2532 cut off 851 5627 his 846 right 1188 ear 3775. 

22:51 And 1161 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, Suffer ye 1439 5720 thus 5127 far 2193. And 2532 he touched 680 5671 his 846 ear 5621, and healed 2390 5662 him 846. 

22:52 Then 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 the chief priests 749, and 2532 captains 4755 of the temple 2411, and 2532 the elders 4245, which were come 3854 5637 to 1909 him 846, Be ye come out 1831 5758, as 5613 against 1909 a thief 3027, with 3326 swords 3162 and 2532 staves 3586? 

22:53 When 5607 0 I 3450 was 5607 5752 daily 2250 2596 with 3326 you 5216 in 1722 the temple 2411, ye stretched forth 1614 5656 no 3756 hands 5495 against 1909 me 1691: but 235 this 3778 is 2076 5748 your 5216 hour 5610, and 2532 the power 1849 of darkness 4655. 

22:54 Then 1161 took they 4815 5631 him 846, and led 71 5627 [him], and 2532 brought 1521 5627 him 846 into 1519 the high priest's 749 house 3624. And 1161 Peter 4074 followed 190 5707 afar off 3113. 

22:55 And 1161 when they had kindled 681 5660 a fire 4442 in 1722 the midst 3319 of the hall 833, and 2532 were set down together 4776 5660, Peter 4074 sat down 2521 5711 among 3319 1722 them 846. 

22:56 But 1161 a certain 5100 maid 3814 beheld 1492 5631 him 846 as he sat 2521 5740 by 4314 the fire 5457, and 2532 earnestly looked 816 5660 upon him 846, and said 2036 5627, This man 3778 was 2258 5713 also 2532 with 4862 him 846. 

22:57 And 1161 he denied 720 5662 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Woman 1135, I know 1492 5758 him 846 not 3756. 

22:58 And 2532 after 3326 a little while 1024 another 2087 saw 1492 5631 him 846, and said 5346 5713, Thou 4771 art 1488 5748 also 2532 of 1537 them 846. And 1161 Peter 4074 said 2036 5627, Man 444, I am 1510 5748 not 3756. 

22:59 And 2532 about 5616 the space 1339 5631 of one 3391 hour 5610 after another 243 5100 confidently affirmed 1340 5711, saying 3004 5723, Of 1909 a truth 225 this 3778 [fellow] also 2532 was 2258 5713 with 3326 him 846: for 1063 2532 he is 2076 5748 a Galilaean 1057. 

22:60 And 1161 Peter 4074 said 2036 5627, Man 444, I know 1492 5758 not 3756 what 3739 thou sayest 3004 5719. And 2532 immediately 3916, while he 846 yet 2089 spake 2980 5723, the cock 220 crew 5455 5656. 

22:61 And 2532 the Lord 2962 turned 4762 5651, and looked upon 1689 5656 Peter 4074. And 2532 Peter 4074 remembered 5279 5656 the word 3056 of the Lord 2962, how 5613 he had said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Before 3754 4250 the cock 220 crow 5455 5658, thou shalt deny 533 5695 me 3165 thrice 5151. 

22:62 And 2532 Peter 4074 went 1831 5631 out 1854, and wept 2799 5656 bitterly 4090. 

22:63 And 2532 the men 435 that held 4912 5723 Jesus 2424 mocked 1702 5707 him 846, and smote 1194 5723 [him]. 

22:64 And 2532 when they had blindfolded 4028 5660 him 846, they struck 5180 5707 him 846 on the face 4383, and 2532 asked 1905 5707 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Prophesy 4395 5657, who 5101 is it 2076 5748 that smote 3817 5660 thee 4571? 

22:65 And 2532 many 4183 other things 2087 blasphemously 987 5723 spake they 3004 5707 against 1519 him 846. 

22:66 And 2532 as soon as 5613 it was 1096 5633 day 2250, the elders 4244 of the people 2992 and 5037 the chief priests 749 and 2532 the scribes 1122 came together 4863 5681, and 2532 led 321 5627 him 846 into 1519 their 1438 council 4892, saying 3004 5723, 

22:67 1487 Art 1488 5748 thou 4771 the Christ 5547? tell 2036 5628 us 2254. And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, If 1437 I tell 2036 5632 you 5213, ye will 4100 0 not 3364 believe 4100 5661: 

22:68 And 1161 if 1437 I also 2532 ask 2065 5661 [you], ye will 611 0 not 3364 answer 611 5676 me 3427, nor 2228 let [me] go 630 5661. 

22:69 Hereafter 3568 575 shall 2071 5704 the Son 5207 of man 444 sit 2521 5740 on 1537 the right hand 1188 of the power 1411 of God 2316. 

22:70 Then 1161 said 5346 5713 they all 3956, Art 1488 5748 thou 4771 then 3767 the Son 5207 of God 2316? And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Ye 5210 say 3004 5719 that 3754 I 1473 am 1510 5748. 

22:71 And 1161 they said 2036 5627, What 5101 need 2192 5719 we 5532 any further 2089 witness 3141? for 1063 we ourselves 846 have heard 191 5656 of 575 his own 846 mouth 4750. 

23:1 And 2532 the whole 537 multitude 4128 of them 846 arose 450 5631, and led 71 5627 him 846 unto 1909 Pilate 4091. 

23:2 And 1161 they began 756 5662 to accuse 2723 5721 him 846, saying 3004 5723, We found 2147 5627 this 5126 [fellow] perverting 1294 5723 the nation 1484, and 2532 forbidding 2967 5723 to give 1325 5721 tribute 5411 to Caesar 2541, saying 3004 5723 that he himself 1438 is 1511 5750 Christ 5547 a King 935. 

23:3 And 1161 Pilate 4091 asked 1905 5656 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Art 1488 5748 thou 4771 the King 935 of the Jews 2453? And 1161 he answered 611 5679 him 846 and said 5346 5713, Thou 4771 sayest 3004 5719 [it]. 

23:4 Then 1161 said 2036 5627 Pilate 4091 to 4314 the chief priests 749 and 2532 [to] the people 3793, I find 2147 5719 no 3762 fault 158 in 1722 this 5129 man 444. 

23:5 And 1161 they were the more fierce 2001 5707, saying 3004 5723 3754, He stirreth up 383 5719 the people 2992, teaching 1321 5723 throughout 2596 all 3650 Jewry 2449, beginning 756 5671 from 575 Galilee 1056 to 2193 this place 5602. 

23:6 When 1161 Pilate 4091 heard 191 5660 of Galilee 1056, he asked 1905 5656 whether 1487 the man 444 were 2076 5748 a Galilaean 1057. 

23:7 And 2532 as soon as he knew 1921 5631 that 3754 he belonged 2076 5748 unto 1537 Herod's 2264 jurisdiction 1849, he sent 375 5656 him 846 to 4314 Herod 2264, who 5607 0 himself 846 also 2532 was 5607 5752 at 1722 Jerusalem 2414 at 1722 that 5025 time 2250. 

23:8 And 1161 when Herod 2264 saw 1492 5631 Jesus 2424, he was exceeding 3029 glad 5463 5644: for 1063 he was 2258 5713 desirous 2309 5723 to see 1492 5629 him 846 of 1537 a long 2425 [season], because 1223 he had heard 191 5721 many things 4183 of 4012 him 846; and 2532 he hoped 1679 5707 to have seen 1492 5629 some 5100 miracle 4592 done 1096 5740 by 5259 him 846. 

23:9 Then 1161 he questioned 1905 5707 with him 846 in 1722 many 2425 words 3056; but 1161 he answered 611 5662 him 846 nothing 3762. 

23:10 And 1161 the chief priests 749 and 2532 scribes 1122 stood 2476 5715 and vehemently 2159 accused 2723 5723 him 846. 

23:11 And 1161 Herod 2264 with 4862 his 848 men of war 4753 set him at nought 1848 5660, and 2532 mocked 1702 5660 [him], and arrayed 4016 5631 him 846 in a gorgeous 2986 robe 2066, and sent 375 0 him 846 again 375 5656 to Pilate 4091. 

23:12 And 1161 3739 the same 1722 846 day 2250 Pilate 4091 and 2532 Herod 2264 were made 1096 5633 friends 5384 together 3326 5037 240: for 1063 before 4391 5707 they were 5607 5752 at 1722 enmity 2189 between 4314 themselves 1438. 

23:13 And 1161 Pilate 4091, when he had called together 4779 5671 the chief priests 749 and 2532 the rulers 758 and 2532 the people 2992, 

23:14 Said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Ye have brought 4374 5656 this 5129 man 444 unto me 3427, as 5613 one that perverteth 654 5723 the people 2992: and 2532, behold 2400 5628, I 1473, having examined 350 5660 [him] before 1799 you 5216, have found 2147 5627 no 3762 fault 158 in 1722 this 5126 man 444 touching those things whereof 2596 ye accuse 2723 5719 him 846: 

23:15 No 235, nor yet 3761 Herod 2264: for 1063 I sent 375 5656 you 5209 to 4314 him 846; and 2532, lo 2400 5628, nothing 3762 worthy 514 of death 2288 is 2076 5748 done 4238 5772 unto him 846. 

23:16 I will 3811 0 therefore 3767 chastise 3811 5660 him 846, and release 630 5692 [him]. 

23:17 (For 1161 of necessity 318 he must 2192 5707 release 630 5721 one 1520 unto them 846 at 2596 the feast 1859) 

23:18 And 1161 they cried out 349 5656 all at once 3826, saying 3004 5723, Away with 142 5720 this 5126 [man], and 1161 release 630 5657 unto us 2254 Barabbas 912: 

23:19 (Who 3748 for 2258 5713 1223 a certain 5100 sedition 4714 made 1096 5637 in 1722 the city 4172, and 2532 for murder 5408, was cast 906 5772 into 1519 prison 5438) 

23:20 Pilate 4091 therefore 3767, willing 2309 5723 to release 630 5658 Jesus 2424, spake 4377 0 again 3825 to them 4377 5656. 

23:21 But 1161 they cried 2019 5707, saying 3004 5723, Crucify 4717 5657 [him], crucify 4717 5657 him 846. 

23:22 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846 the third time 5154, Why 1063, what 5101 evil 2556 hath 4160 0 he 3778 done 4160 5656? I have found 2147 5627 no 3762 cause 158 of death 2288 in 1722 him 846: I will 3811 0 therefore 3767 chastise 3811 5660 him 846, and let [him] go 630 5692. 

23:23 And 1161 they were instant 1945 5711 with loud 3173 voices 5456, requiring 154 5734 that he 846 might be crucified 4717 5683. And 2532 the voices 5456 of them 846 and 2532 of the chief priests 749 prevailed 2729 5707. 

23:24 And 1161 Pilate 4091 gave sentence 1948 5656 that it should be as 1096 5635 they 846 required 155. 

23:25 And 1161 he released 630 5656 unto them 846 him that for 1223 sedition 4714 and 2532 murder 5408 was cast 906 5772 into 1519 prison 5438, whom 3739 they had desired 154 5710; but 1161 he delivered 3860 5656 Jesus 2424 to their 846 will 2307. 

23:26 And 2532 as 5613 they led 520 0 him 846 away 520 5627, they laid hold upon 1949 5637 one 5100 Simon 4613, a Cyrenian 2956, coming 2064 5740 out of 575 the country 68, and on 2007 0 him 846 they laid 2007 5656 the cross 4716, that he might bear 5342 5721 [it] after 3693 Jesus 2424. 

23:27 And 1161 there followed 190 5707 him 846 a great 4183 company 4128 of people 2992, and 2532 of women 1135, which 3739 also 2532 bewailed 2875 5710 and 2532 lamented 2354 5707 him 846. 

23:28 But 1161 Jesus 2424 turning 4762 5651 unto 4314 them 846 said 2036 5627, Daughters 2364 of Jerusalem 2419, weep 2799 5720 not 3361 for 1909 me 1691, but 4133 weep 2799 5720 for 1909 yourselves 1438, and 2532 for 1909 your 5216 children 5043. 

23:29 For 3754, behold 2400 5628, the days 2250 are coming 2064 5736, in 1722 the which 3739 they shall say 2046 5692, Blessed 3107 [are] the barren 4723, and 2532 the wombs 2836 that 3739 never 3756 bare 1080 5656, and 2532 the paps 3149 which 3739 never 3756 gave suck 2337 5656. 

23:30 Then 5119 shall they begin 756 5698 to say 3004 5721 to the mountains 3735, Fall 4098 5628 on 1909 us 2248; and 2532 to the hills 1015, Cover 2572 5657 us 2248. 

23:31 For 3754 if 1487 they do 4160 5719 these things 5023 in 1722 a green 5200 tree 3586, what 5101 shall be done 1096 5638 in 1722 the dry 3584? 

23:32 And 1161 there were also 2532 two 1417 other 2087, malefactors 2557, led 71 5712 with 4862 him 846 to be put to death 337 5683. 

23:33 And 2532 when 3753 they were come 565 5627 to 1909 the place 5117, which 3588 is called 2564 5746 Calvary 2898, there 1563 they crucified 4717 5656 him 846, and 2532 the malefactors 2557, one 3303 on 1537 the right hand 1188, and 1161 the other 3739 on 1537 the left 710. 

23:34 Then 1161 said 3004 5707 Jesus 2424, Father 3962, forgive 863 5628 them 846; for 1063 they know 1492 5758 not 3756 what 5101 they do 4160 5719. And 1161 they parted 1266 5734 his 846 raiment 2440, and cast 906 5627 lots 2819. 

23:35 And 2532 the people 2992 stood 2476 5715 beholding 2334 5723. And 1161 the rulers 758 also 2532 with 4862 them 846 derided 1592 5707 [him], saying 3004 5723, He saved 4982 5656 others 243; let him save 4982 5657 himself 1438, if 1487 he 3778 be 2076 5748 Christ 5547, the chosen 1588 of God 2316. 

23:36 And 1161 the soldiers 4757 also 2532 mocked 1702 5707 him 846, coming 4334 5740 to him, and 2532 offering 4374 5723 him 846 vinegar 3690, 

23:37 And 2532 saying 3004 5723, If 1487 thou 4771 be 1488 5748 the king 935 of the Jews 2453, save 4982 5657 thyself 4572. 

23:38 And 1161 a superscription 1923 also 2532 was 2258 5713 written 1125 5772 over 1909 him 846 in letters 1121 of Greek 1673, and 2532 Latin 4513, and 2532 Hebrew 1444, THIS 3778 IS 2076 5748 THE KING 935 OF THE JEWS 2453. 

23:39 And 1161 one 1520 of the malefactors 2557 which were hanged 2910 5685 railed 987 5707 on him 846, saying 3004 5723, If 1487 thou 4771 be 1488 5748 Christ 5547, save 4982 5657 thyself 4572 and 2532 us 2248. 

23:40 But 1161 the other 2087 answering 611 5679 rebuked 2008 5707 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Dost 5399 0 not 3761 thou 4771 fear 5399 5736 God 2316, seeing 3754 thou art 1488 5748 in 1722 the same 846 condemnation 2917? 

23:41 And 2532 we 2249 indeed 3303 justly 1346; for 1063 we receive 618 5719 the due reward 514 of our 3739 deeds 4238 5656: but 1161 this man 3778 hath done 4238 5656 nothing 3762 amiss 824. 

23:42 And 2532 he said 3004 5707 unto Jesus 2424, Lord 2962, remember 3415 5682 me 3450 when 3752 thou comest 2064 5632 into 1722 thy 4675 kingdom 932. 

23:43 And 2532 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto thee 4671, To day 4594 shalt thou be 2071 5704 with 3326 me 1700 in 1722 paradise 3857. 

23:44 And 1161 it was 2258 5713 about 5616 the sixth 1623 hour 5610, and 2532 there was 1096 5633 a darkness 4655 over 1909 all 3650 the earth 1093 until 2193 the ninth 1766 hour 5610. 

23:45 And 2532 the sun 2246 was darkened 4654 5681, and 2532 the veil 2665 of the temple 3485 was rent 4977 5681 in the midst 3319. 

23:46 And 2532 when Jesus 2424 had cried 5455 5660 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, he said 2036 5627, Father 3962, into 1519 thy 4675 hands 5495 I commend 3908 5695 my 3450 spirit 4151: and 2532 having said 2036 5631 thus 5023, he gave up the ghost 1606 5656. 

23:47 Now 1161 when the centurion 1543 saw 1492 5631 what was done 1096 5637, he glorified 1392 5656 God 2316, saying 3004 5723, Certainly 3689 this 3778 was 2258 5713 a righteous 1342 man 444. 

23:48 And 2532 all 3956 the people 3793 that came together 4836 5637 to 1909 that 5026 sight 2335, beholding 2334 5723 the things which were done 1096 5637, smote 5180 5723 their 1438 breasts 4738, and returned 5290 5707. 

23:49 And 1161 all 3956 his 846 acquaintance 1110, and 2532 the women 1135 that followed 4870 5660 him 846 from 575 Galilee 1056, stood 2476 5715 afar off 3113, beholding 3708 5723 these things 5023. 

23:50 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, [there was] a man 435 named 3686 Joseph 2501, a counsellor 1010; [and he was] a good 5225 5723 18 man 435, and 2532 a just 1342: 

23:51 (The same 3778 had 4784 0 not 3756 consented 4784 5768 2258 5713 to the counsel 1012 and 2532 deed 4234 of them 846) [he was] of 575 Arimathaea 707, a city 4172 of the Jews 2453: 2532 who 3739 also 2532 himself 846 waited for 4327 5711 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. 

23:52 This 3778 [man] went 4334 5631 unto Pilate 4091, and begged 154 5668 the body 4983 of Jesus 2424. 

23:53 And 2532 he took 2507 0 it 846 down 2507 5631, and wrapped 1794 5656 it 846 in linen 4616, and 2532 laid 5087 5656 it 846 in 1722 a sepulchre 3418 that was hewn in stone 2991, wherein 3757 never 3756 man 3764 before 3762 was 2258 5713 laid 2749 5740. 

23:54 And 2532 that day 2250 was 2258 5713 the preparation 3904, and 2532 the sabbath 4521 drew on 2020 5707. 

23:55 And 1161 the women 1135 also 2532, which 3748 came 2258 5713 4905 5761 with him 846 from 1537 Galilee 1056, followed after 2628 5660, and beheld 2300 5662 the sepulchre 3419, and 2532 how 5613 his 846 body 4983 was laid 5087 5681. 

23:56 And they returned 5290 5660, and 1161 prepared 2090 5656 spices 759 and 2532 ointments 3464; and 2532 rested 2270 5656 3303 the sabbath day 4521 according 2596 to the commandment 1785. 

24:1 Now 1161 upon the first 3391 [day] of the week 4521, very early in the morning 3722 901, they came 2064 5627 unto 1909 the sepulchre 3418, bringing 5342 5723 the spices 759 which 3739 they had prepared 2090 5656, and 2532 certain 5100 [others] with 4862 them 846. 

24:2 And 1161 they found 2147 5627 the stone 3037 rolled away 617 5772 from 575 the sepulchre 3419. 

24:3 And 2532 they entered in 1525 5631, and found 2147 5627 not 3756 the body 4983 of the Lord 2962 Jesus 2424. 

24:4 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, as 1722 they were much perplexed 1280 5745 thereabout 4012 5127, 2532 behold 2400 5628, two 1417 men 435 stood by 2186 5627 them 846 in 1722 shining 797 5723 garments 2067: 

24:5 And 1161 as 1096 0 they 846 were 1096 5637 afraid 1719, and 2532 bowed down 2827 5723 [their] faces 4383 to 1519 the earth 1093, they said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, Why 5101 seek ye 2212 5719 the living 2198 5723 among 3326 the dead 3498? 

24:6 He is 2076 5748 not 3756 here 5602, but 235 is risen 1453 5681: remember 3415 5682 how 5613 he spake 2980 5656 unto you 5213 when he was 5607 5752 yet 2089 in 1722 Galilee 1056, 

24:7 Saying 3004 5723, 3754 The Son 5207 of man 444 must 1163 5748 be delivered 3860 5683 into 1519 the hands 5495 of sinful 268 men 444, and 2532 be crucified 4717 5683, and 2532 the third 5154 day 2250 rise again 450 5629. 

24:8 And 2532 they remembered 3415 5681 his 846 words 4487, 

24:9 And 2532 returned 5290 5660 from 575 the sepulchre 3419, and told 518 5656 all 3956 these things 5023 unto the eleven 1733, and 2532 to all 3956 the rest 3062. 

24:10 1161 It was 2258 5713 Mary 3137 Magdalene 3094, and 2532 Joanna 2489, and 2532 Mary 3137 [the mother] of James 2385, and 2532 other 3062 [women that were] with 4862 them 846, which 3739 told 3004 5707 these things 5023 unto 4314 the apostles 652. 

24:11 And 2532 their 846 words 4487 seemed 5316 5648 to 1799 them 846 as 5616 idle tales 3026, and 2532 they believed 569 0 them 846 not 569 5707. 

24:12 Then 1161 arose 450 5631 Peter 4074, and ran 5143 5627 unto 1909 the sepulchre 3419; and 2532 stooping down 3879 5660, he beheld 991 5719 the linen clothes 3608 laid 2749 5740 by themselves 3441, and 2532 departed 565 5627, wondering 2296 5723 in 4314 himself 1438 at that which was come to pass 1096 5756. 

24:13 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, two 1417 of 1537 them 846 went 2258 5713 4198 5740 that 1722 same 846 day 2250 to 1519 a village 2968 called 3739 3686 Emmaus 1695, which was 568 5723 from 575 Jerusalem 2419 [about] threescore 1835 furlongs 4712. 

24:14 And 2532 they 846 talked 3656 5707 together 4314 240 of 4012 all 3956 these things 5130 which had happened 4819 5761. 

24:15 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, that, while 1722 they 846 communed 3656 5721 [together] and 2532 reasoned 4802 5721, Jesus 2424 himself 2532 846 drew near 1448 5660, and went with 4848 5711 them 846. 

24:16 But 1161 their 846 eyes 3788 were holden 2902 5712 that they should 1921 0 not 3361 know 1921 5629 him 846. 

24:17 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, What 5101 manner of communications 3056 [are] these 3778 that ye have 474 5719 one to 4314 another 240, as ye walk 4043 5723, and 2532 are 2075 5748 sad 4659? 

24:18 And 1161 the one of them 1520, whose 3739 name 3686 was Cleopas 2810, answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627 unto 4314 him 846, Art thou 4771 only 3441 a stranger 3939 5719 in 1722 Jerusalem 2419, and 2532 hast 1097 0 not 3756 known 1097 5627 the things which are come to pass 1096 5637 there 1722 846 in 1722 these 5025 days 2250? 

24:19 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, What things 4169? And 1161 they said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Concerning 4012 Jesus 2424 of Nazareth 3480, which 3739 was 1096 5633 a prophet 4396 mighty 1415 in 1722 435 deed 2041 and 2532 word 3056 before 1726 God 2316 and 2532 all 3956 the people 2992: 

24:20 And how 3704 5037 the chief priests 749 and 2532 our 2257 rulers 758 delivered him 3860 5656 to 1519 be condemned 2917 to death 2288, and 2532 have crucified 4717 5656 him 846. 

24:21 But 1161 we 2249 trusted 1679 5707 that 3754 it had been 2076 5748 he 846 which should 3195 5723 have redeemed 3084 5733 Israel 2474: and 235 beside 1065 4862 all 3956 this 5125, to day 4594 is 71 5719 the 5026 third 5154 day 2250 since 575 3739 these things 5023 were done 1096 5633. 

24:22 Yea 235, and certain 5100 women 1135 also 2532 of 1537 our company 2257 made 1839 0 us 2248 astonished 1839 5627, which were 1096 5637 early 3721 at 1909 the sepulchre 3419; 

24:23 And 2532 when they found 2147 5631 not 3361 his 846 body 4983, they came 2064 5627, saying 3004 5723, that they had 3708 0 also 2532 seen 3708 5760 a vision 3701 of angels 32, which 3739 said 3004 5719 that he 846 was alive 2198 5721. 

24:24 And 2532 certain of them 5100 which were with 4862 us 2254 went 565 5627 to 1909 the sepulchre 3419, and 2532 found 2147 5627 [it] even 2532 so 3779 as 2531 the women 1135 had said 2036 5627: but 1161 him 846 they saw 1492 5627 not 3756. 

24:25 Then 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto 4314 them 846, O 5599 fools 453, and 2532 slow 1021 of heart 2588 to believe 4100 5721 1909 all 3956 that 3739 the prophets 4396 have spoken 2980 5656: 

24:26 Ought 1163 5713 not 3780 Christ 5547 to have suffered 3958 5629 these things 5023, and 2532 to enter 1525 5629 into 1519 his 848 glory 1391? 

24:27 And 2532 beginning 756 5671 at 575 Moses 3475 and 2532 575 all 3956 the prophets 4396, he expounded 1329 5707 unto them 846 in 1722 all 3956 the scriptures 1124 the things concerning 4012 himself 1438. 

24:28 And 2532 they drew nigh 1448 5656 unto 1519 the village 2968, whither 3757 they went 4198 5711: and 2532 he made as though 4364 5710 he would have gone 4198 5738 further 4208. 

24:29 But 2532 they constrained 3849 5662 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Abide 3306 5657 with 3326 us 2257: for 3754 it is 2076 5748 toward 4314 evening 2073, and 2532 the day 2250 is far spent 2827 5758. And 2532 he went in 1525 5627 to tarry 3306 5658 with 4862 them 846. 

24:30 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, as 1722 he 846 sat at meat 2625 5683 with 3326 them 846, he took 2983 5631 bread 740, and blessed 2127 5656 [it], and 2532 brake 2806 5660, and gave 1929 5707 to them 846. 

24:31 And 1161 their 846 eyes 3788 were opened 1272 5681, and 2532 they knew 1921 5627 him 846; and 2532 he 846 vanished 1096 5633 855 out of 575 their sight 846. 

24:32 And 2532 they said 2036 5627 one to another 4314 240, Did 2258 5713 not 3780 our 2257 heart 2588 burn 2545 5746 within 1722 us 2254, while 5613 he talked 2980 5707 with us 2254 by 1722 the way 3598, and 2532 while 5613 he opened 1272 5707 to us 2254 the scriptures 1124? 

24:33 And 2532 they rose up 450 5631 the same 846 hour 5610, and returned 5290 5656 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419, and 2532 found 2147 5627 the eleven 1733 gathered together 4867 5772, and 2532 them that were with 4862 them 846, 

24:34 Saying 3004 5723, 3754 The Lord 2962 is risen 1453 5681 indeed 3689, and 2532 hath appeared 3700 5681 to Simon 4613. 

24:35 And 2532 they told 1834 5711 what things [were done] in 1722 the way 3598, and 2532 how 5613 he was known 1097 5681 of them 846 in 1722 breaking 2800 of bread 740. 

24:36 And 1161 as they 846 thus 5023 spake 2980 5723, Jesus 2424 himself 846 stood 2476 5627 in 1722 the midst 3319 of them 846, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Peace 1515 [be] unto you 5213. 

24:37 But 1161 they were terrified 4422 5685 and 2532 affrighted 1719 1096 5637, and supposed 1380 5707 that they had seen 2334 5721 a spirit 4151. 

24:38 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Why 5101 are ye 2075 5748 troubled 5015 5772? and 2532 why 1302 do thoughts 1261 arise 305 5719 in 1722 your 5216 hearts 2588? 

24:39 Behold 1492 5628 my 3450 hands 5495 and 2532 my 3450 feet 4228, that 3754 it is 1510 5748 I 1473 myself 846: handle 5584 5657 me 3165, and 2532 see 1492 5628; for 3754 a spirit 4151 hath 2192 5719 not 3756 flesh 4561 and 2532 bones 3747, as 2531 ye see 2334 5719 me 1691 have 2192 5723. 

24:40 And 2532 when he had thus 5124 spoken 2036 5631, he shewed 1925 5656 them 846 [his] hands 5495 and 2532 [his] feet 4228. 

24:41 And 1161 while they yet 2089 believed not 569 5723 for 575 joy 5479, and 2532 wondered 2296 5723, he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Have ye 2192 5719 here 1759 any 5100 meat 1034? 

24:42 And 1161 they gave 1929 5656 him 846 a piece 3313 of a broiled 3702 fish 2486, and 2532 of 575 an honeycomb 3193 2781. 

24:43 And 2532 he took 2983 5631 [it], and did eat 5315 5627 before 1799 them 846. 

24:44 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, These 3778 [are] the words 3056 which 3739 I spake 2980 5656 unto 4314 you 5209, while 5607 5752 I was yet 2089 with 4862 you 5213, that 3754 all things 3956 must 1163 5748 be fulfilled 4137 5683, which 3588 were written 1125 5772 in 1722 the law 3551 of Moses 3475, and 2532 [in] the prophets 4396, and 2532 [in] the psalms 5568, concerning 4012 me 1700. 

24:45 Then 5119 opened he 1272 5656 their 846 understanding 3563, that they might understand 4920 5721 the scriptures 1124, 

24:46 And 2532 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Thus 3754 3779 it is written 1125 5769, and 2532 thus 3779 it behoved 1163 5713 Christ 5547 to suffer 3958 5629, and 2532 to rise 450 5629 from 1537 the dead 3498 the third 5154 day 2250: 

24:47 And 2532 that repentance 3341 and 2532 remission 859 of sins 266 should be preached 2784 5683 in 1909 his 846 name 3686 among 1519 all 3956 nations 1484, beginning 756 5671 at 575 Jerusalem 2419. 

24:48 And 1161 ye 5210 are 2075 5748 witnesses 3144 of these things 5130. 

24:49 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, I 1473 send 649 5719 the promise 1860 of my 3450 Father 3962 upon 1909 you 5209: but 1161 tarry 2523 5657 ye 5210 in 1722 the city 4172 of Jerusalem 2419, until 2193 ye 3739 be endued 1746 5672 with power 1411 from 1537 on high 5311. 

24:50 And 1161 he led 1806 5627 them 846 out 1854 as far as 2193 to 1519 Bethany 963, and 2532 he lifted up 1869 5660 his 848 hands 5495, and blessed 2127 5656 them 846. 

24:51 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, while 1722 he 846 blessed 2127 5721 them 846, he was parted 1339 5627 from 575 them 846, and 2532 carried up 399 5712 into 1519 heaven 3772. 

24:52 And 2532 they 846 worshipped 4352 5660 him 846, and returned 5290 5656 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419 with 3326 great 3173 joy 5479: 

24:53 And 2532 were 2258 5713 continually 1275 in 1722 the temple 2411, praising 134 5723 and 2532 blessing 2127 5723 God 2316. Amen 281.
