1:1 Now after 310 the death 4194 of Joshua 3091 it came to pass, that the children 1121 of Israel 3478 asked 7592-4 the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 Who shall go up 5927-4 for us against the Canaanites 3669 first, 8462 to fight 3898-9 against them?

1:2 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 Judah 3063 shall go up: 5927-4 behold, I have delivered 5414-1 the land 776 into his hand. 3027

1:3 And Judah 3063 said 559-4 unto Simeon 8095 his brother, 251 Come up 5927-3 with me into my lot, 1486 that we may fight 3898-11 against the Canaanites; 3669 and I likewise will go 1980-1 with thee into thy lot. 1486 So Simeon 8095 went 3212-4 with him.

1:4 And Judah 3063 went up; 5927-4 and the LORD 3068 delivered 5414-4 the Canaanites 3669 and the Perizzites 6522 into their hand: 3027 and they slew 5221-55 of them in Bezek 966 ten 6235 thousand 505 men. 376

1:5 And they found 4672-4 Adonibezek 137 in Bezek: 966 and they fought 3898-11 against him, and they slew 5221-55 the Canaanites 3669 and the Perizzites. 6522

1:6 But Adonibezek 137 fled; 5127-4 and they pursued 7291-4 after 310 him, and caught 270-4 him, and cut off 7112-17 his thumbs 931 3027 and his great toes. 7272

1:7 And Adonibezek 137 said, 559-4 Threescore and ten 7657 kings, 4428 having their thumbs 931 3027 and their great toes 7272 cut off, 7112-30 gathered 3950-18 [their meat] under my table: 7979 as I have done, 6213-1 so God 430 hath requited 7999-14 me. And they brought 935-55 him to Jerusalem, 3389 and there he died. 4191-4

1:8 Now the children 1121 of Judah 3063 had fought 3898-11 against Jerusalem, 3389 and had taken 3920-4 it, and smitten 5221-55 it with the edge 6310 of the sword, 2719 and set 7971-14 the city 5892 on fire. 784

1:9 And afterward 310 the children 1121 of Judah 3063 went down 3381-1 to fight 3898-9 against the Canaanites, 3669 that dwelt 3427-6 in the mountain, 2022 and in the south, 5045 and in the valley. 8219

1:10 And Judah 3063 went 3212-4 against the Canaanites 3669 that dwelt 3427-6 in Hebron: 2275 (now the name 8034 of Hebron 2275 before 6440 [was] Kirjatharba:) 7153 and they slew 5221-55 Sheshai, 8344 and Ahiman, 289 and Talmai. 8526

1:11 And from thence he went 3212-4 against the inhabitants 3427-6 of Debir: 1688 and the name 8034 of Debir 1688 before 6440 [was] Kirjathsepher: 7158

1:12 And Caleb 3612 said, 559-4 He that smiteth 5221-55 Kirjathsepher, 7158 and taketh 3920-1 it, to him will I give 5414-1 Achsah 5915 my daughter 1323 to wife. 802

1:13 And Othniel 6274 the son 1121 of Kenaz, 7073 Caleb's 3612 younger 6996 brother, 251 took 3920-4 it: and he gave 5414-4 him Achsah 5915 his daughter 1323 to wife. 802

1:14 And it came to pass, when she came 935-2 [to him], that she moved 5496-55 him to ask 7592-2 of her father 1 a field: 7704 and she lighted 6795-4 from off [her] ass; 2543 and Caleb 3612 said 559-4 unto her, What wilt thou?

1:15 And she said 559-4 unto him, Give 3051-3 me a blessing: 1293 for thou hast given 5414-1 me a south 5045 land; 776 give 5414-1 me also springs 1543 of water. 4325 And Caleb 3612 gave 5414-4 her the upper 5942 springs 1543 and the nether 8482 springs. 1543

1:16 And the children 1121 of the Kenite, 7017 Moses' 4872 father in law, 2859-6 went up 5927-1 out of the city of palm trees 5892|8558|5899 with the children 1121 of Judah 3063 into the wilderness 4057 of Judah, 3063 which [lieth] in the south 5045 of Arad; 6166 and they went 3212-4 and dwelt 3427-4 among 854 the people. 5971

1:17 And Judah 3063 went 3212-4 with Simeon 8095 his brother, 251 and they slew 5221-55 the Canaanites 3669 that inhabited 3427-6 Zephath, 6857 and utterly destroyed 2763-55 it. And the name 8034 of the city 5892 was called 7121-4 Hormah. 2767

1:18 Also Judah 3063 took 3920-4 Gaza 5804 with the coast 1366 thereof, and Askelon 831 with the coast 1366 thereof, and Ekron 6138 with the coast 1366 thereof.

1:19 And the LORD 3068 was with Judah; 3063 and he drave out 3423-55 [the inhabitants of] the mountain; 2022 but could not 3808 drive out 3423-53 the inhabitants 3427-6 of the valley, 6010 because they had chariots 7393 of iron. 1270

1:20 And they gave 5414-4 Hebron 2275 unto Caleb, 3612 as Moses 4872 said: 1696-14 and he expelled 3423-55 thence the three 7969 sons 1121 of Anak. 6061

1:21 And the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 did not drive out 3423-52 the Jebusites 2983 that inhabited 3427-6 Jerusalem; 3389 but the Jebusites 2983 dwell 3427-4 with the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 in Jerusalem 3389 unto this day. 3117

1:22 And the house 1004 of Joseph, 3130 they also went up 5927-4 against Bethel: 1008 and the LORD 3068 [was] with them.

1:23 And the house 1004 of Joseph 3130 sent to descry 8446-55 Bethel. 1008 (Now the name 8034 of the city 5892 before 6440 [was] Luz.) 3870

1:24 And the spies 8104-6 saw 7200-4 a man 376 come forth 3318-6 out of the city, 5892 and they said 559-4 unto him, Shew 7200-54 us, we pray thee, the entrance 3996 into the city, 5892 and we will shew 6213-1 thee mercy. 2617

1:25 And when he shewed 7200-55 them the entrance 3996 into the city, 5892 they smote 5221-55 the city 5892 with the edge 6310 of the sword; 2719 but they let go 7971-14 the man 376 and all his family. 4940

1:26 And the man 376 went 3212-4 into the land 776 of the Hittites, 2850 and built 1129-4 a city, 5892 and called 7121-4 the name 8034 thereof Luz: 3870 which [is] the name 8034 thereof unto this day. 3117

1:27 Neither did Manasseh 4519 drive out 3423-52 [the inhabitants of] Bethshean 1052 and her towns, 1323 nor Taanach 8590 and her towns, 1323 nor the inhabitants 3427-6 of Dor 1756 and her towns, 1323 nor the inhabitants 3427-6 of Ibleam 2991 and her towns, 1323 nor the inhabitants 3427-6 of Megiddo 4023 and her towns: 1323 but the Canaanites 3669 would 2974-55 dwell 3427-2 in that land. 776

1:28 And it came to pass, when Israel 3478 was strong, 2388-1 that they put 7760-4 the Canaanites 3669 to tribute, 4522 and did not utterly 3423-53 drive them out. 3423-52

1:29 Neither did Ephraim 669 drive out 3423-52 the Canaanites 3669 that dwelt 3427-6 in Gezer; 1507 but the Canaanites 3669 dwelt 3427-4 in Gezer 1507 among 7130 them.

1:30 Neither did Zebulun 2074 drive out 3423-52 the inhabitants 3427-6 of Kitron, 7003 nor the inhabitants 3427-6 of Nahalol; 5096 but the Canaanites 3669 dwelt 3427-4 among 7130 them, and became tributaries. 4522

1:31 Neither did Asher 836 drive out 3423-52 the inhabitants 3427-6 of Accho, 5910 nor the inhabitants 3427-6 of Zidon, 6721 nor of Ahlab, 303 nor of Achzib, 392 nor of Helbah, 2462 nor of Aphik, 663 nor of Rehob: 7340

1:32 But the Asherites 843 dwelt 3427-4 among 7130 the Canaanites, 3669 the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land: 776 for they did not drive them out. 3423-52

1:33 Neither did Naphtali 5321 drive out 3423-52 the inhabitants 3427-6 of Bethshemesh, 1053 nor the inhabitants 3427-6 of Bethanath; 1043 but he dwelt 3427-4 among 7130 the Canaanites, 3669 the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land: 776 nevertheless the inhabitants 3427-6 of Bethshemesh 1053 and of Bethanath 1043 became tributaries 4522 unto them.

1:34 And the Amorites 567 forced 3905-4 the children 1121 of Dan 1835 into the mountain: 2022 for they would not suffer 5414-1 them to come down 3381-2 to the valley: 6010

1:35 But the Amorites 567 would 2974-55 dwell 3427-2 in mount 2022 Heres 2776 in Aijalon, 357 and in Shaalbim: 8169 yet the hand 3027 of the house 1004 of Joseph 3130 prevailed, 3513-4 so that they became tributaries. 4522

1:36 And the coast 1366 of the Amorites 567 [was] from the going up to Akrabbim, 4608|6137|4610 from the rock, 5553 and upward. 4605

2:1 And an angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 came up 5927-4 from Gilgal 1537 to Bochim, 1066 and said, 559-4 I made you to go up 5927-55 out of Egypt, 4714 and have brought 935-55 you unto the land 776 which I sware 7650-8 unto your fathers; 1 and I said, 559-4 I will never 3808 5769 break 6565-55 my covenant 1285 with you.

2:2 And ye shall make 3772-4 no league 1285 with the inhabitants 3427-6 of this land; 776 ye shall throw down 5422-4 their altars: 4196 but ye have not obeyed 8085-1 my voice: 6963 why have ye done 6213-1 this?

2:3 Wherefore I also said, 559-1 I will not drive them out 1644-17 from before 6440 you; but they shall be [as thorns] in your sides, 6654 and their gods 430 shall be a snare 4170 unto you.

2:4 And it came to pass, when the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 spake 1696-15 these words 1697 unto all the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 that the people 5971 lifted up 5375-4 their voice, 6963 and wept. 1058-4

2:5 And they called 7121-4 the name 8034 of that place 4725 Bochim: 1066 and they sacrificed 2076-4 there unto the LORD. 3068

2:6 And when Joshua 3091 had let the people 5971 go, 7971-17 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 went 3212-4 every man 376 unto his inheritance 5159 to possess 3423-2 the land. 776

2:7 And the people 5971 served 5647-4 the LORD 3068 all the days 3117 of Joshua, 3091 and all the days 3117 of the elders 2205 that outlived 748-52 3117 310 Joshua, 3091 who had seen 7200-1 all the great 1419 works 4639 of the LORD, 3068 that he did 6213-1 for Israel. 3478

2:8 And Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun, 5126 the servant 5650 of the LORD, 3068 died, 4191-4 [being] an hundred 3967 and ten 6235 years 8141 old. 1121

2:9 And they buried 6912-4 him in the border 1366 of his inheritance 5159 in Timnathheres, 8556 in the mount 2022 of Ephraim, 669 on the north 6828 side of the hill 2022 Gaash. 1608

2:10 And also all that generation 1755 were gathered 622-8 unto their fathers: 1 and there arose 6965-4 another 312 generation 1755 after 310 them, which knew 3045-1 not the LORD, 3068 nor yet the works 4639 which he had done 6213-1 for Israel. 3478

2:11 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did 6213-4 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 and served 5647-4 Baalim: 1168

2:12 And they forsook 5800-4 the LORD 3068 God 430 of their fathers, 1 which brought them out 3318-56 of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 and followed 3212-4 310 other 312 gods, 430 of the gods 430 of the people 5971 that [were] round about 5439 them, and bowed 7812-101 themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD 3068 to anger. 3707-55

2:13 And they forsook 5800-4 the LORD, 3068 and served 5647-4 Baal 1168 and Ashtaroth. 6252

2:14 And the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 was hot 2734-4 against Israel, 3478 and he delivered 5414-4 them into the hands 3027 of spoilers 8154-6 that spoiled 8155-4 them, and he sold 4376-4 them into the hands 3027 of their enemies 341-6 round about, 5439 so that they could 3201-1 not any longer 5750 stand 5975-2 before 6440 their enemies. 341-6

2:15 Whithersoever they went out, 3318-1 the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 was against them for evil, 7451 as the LORD 3068 had said, 1696-14 and as the LORD 3068 had sworn 7650-8 unto them: and they were greatly 3966 distressed. 3334-4

2:16 Nevertheless the LORD 3068 raised up 6965-55 judges, 8199-6 which delivered 3467-55 them out of the hand 3027 of those that spoiled 8154-6 them.

2:17 And yet they would not hearken 8085-1 unto their judges, 8199-6 but they went a whoring 2181-1 after 310 other 312 gods, 430 and bowed 7812-101 themselves unto them: they turned 5493-1 quickly 4118 out of the way 1870 which their fathers 1 walked 1980-1 in, obeying 8085-2 the commandments 4687 of the LORD; 3068 [but] they did 6213-1 not so.

2:18 And when the LORD 3068 raised them up 6965-52 judges, 8199-6 then the LORD 3068 was with the judge, 8199-6 and delivered 3467-52 them out of the hand 3027 of their enemies 341-6 all the days 3117 of the judge: 8199-6 for it repented 5162-11 the LORD 3068 because 6440 of their groanings 5009 by reason of them that oppressed 3905-5 them and vexed 1766-6 them.

2:19 And it came to pass, when the judge 8199-6 was dead, 4194 [that] they returned, 7725-4 and corrupted 7843-52 [themselves] more than their fathers, 1 in following 3212-2 310 other 312 gods 430 to serve 5647-2 them, and to bow down 7812-99 unto them; they ceased 5307-52 not from their own doings, 4611 nor from their stubborn 7186 way. 1870

2:20 And the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 was hot 2734-4 against Israel; 3478 and he said, 559-4 Because that this people 1471 hath transgressed 5674-1 my covenant 1285 which I commanded 6680-14 their fathers, 1 and have not hearkened 8085-1 unto my voice; 6963

2:21 I also will not henceforth 3254-55 drive out 3423-53 any 376 from before 6440 them of the nations 1471 which Joshua 3091 left 5800-1 when he died: 4191-4

2:22 That through them I may prove 5254-15 Israel, 3478 whether they will keep 8104-6 the way 1870 of the LORD 3068 to walk 3212-2 therein, as their fathers 1 did keep 8104-1 [it], or not.

2:23 Therefore the LORD 3068 left 3240-55 those nations, 1471 without 1115 driving them out 3423-53 hastily; 4118 neither delivered 5414-1 he them into the hand 3027 of Joshua. 3091

3:1 Now these [are] the nations 1471 which the LORD 3068 left, 3240-52 to prove 5254-15 Israel 3478 by them, [even] as many [of Israel] as had not known 3045-1 all the wars 4421 of Canaan; 3667

3:2 Only 7535 that the generations 1755 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 might know, 3045-2 to teach 3925-15 them war, 4421 at the least 7535 such as before 6440 knew 3045-1 nothing thereof;

3:3 [Namely], five 2568 lords 5633 of the Philistines, 6430 and all the Canaanites, 3669 and the Sidonians, 6722 and the Hivites 2340 that dwelt 3427-6 in mount 2022 Lebanon, 3844 from mount 2022 Baalhermon 1179 unto the entering in 935-2 of Hamath. 2574

3:4 And they were to prove 5254-15 Israel 3478 by them, to know 3045-2 whether they would hearken 8085-4 unto the commandments 4687 of the LORD, 3068 which he commanded 6680-14 their fathers 1 by the hand 3027 of Moses. 4872

3:5 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 dwelt 3427-1 among 7130 the Canaanites, 3669 Hittites, 2850 and Amorites, 567 and Perizzites, 6522 and Hivites, 2340 and Jebusites: 2983

3:6 And they took 3947-4 their daughters 1323 to be their wives, 802 and gave 5414-1 their daughters 1323 to their sons, 1121 and served 5647-4 their gods. 430

3:7 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did 6213-4 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 and forgat 7911-4 the LORD 3068 their God, 430 and served 5647-4 Baalim 1168 and the groves. 842

3:8 Therefore the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 was hot 2734-4 against Israel, 3478 and he sold 4376-4 them into the hand 3027 of Chushanrishathaim 3573 king 4428 of Mesopotamia: 763 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 served 5647-4 Chushanrishathaim 3573 eight 8083 years. 8141

3:9 And when the children 1121 of Israel 3478 cried 2199-4 unto the LORD, 3068 the LORD 3068 raised up 6965-55 a deliverer 3467-56 to the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 who delivered 3467-55 them, [even] Othniel 6274 the son 1121 of Kenaz, 7073 Caleb's 3612 younger 6996 brother. 251

3:10 And the Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 came upon him, and he judged 8199-4 Israel, 3478 and went out 3318-4 to war: 4421 and the LORD 3068 delivered 5414-4 Chushanrishathaim 3573 king 4428 of Mesopotamia 758 into his hand; 3027 and his hand 3027 prevailed 5810-4 against Chushanrishathaim. 3573

3:11 And the land 776 had rest 8252-4 forty 705 years. 8141 And Othniel 6274 the son 1121 of Kenaz 7073 died. 4191-4

3:12 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did 6213-2 evil 7451 again 3254-55 in the sight 5869 of the LORD: 3068 and the LORD 3068 strengthened 2388-17 Eglon 5700 the king 4428 of Moab 4124 against Israel, 3478 because they had done 6213-1 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD. 3068

3:13 And he gathered 622-4 unto him the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 and Amalek, 6002 and went 3212-4 and smote 5221-55 Israel, 3478 and possessed 3423-4 the city of palm trees. 5892|8558|5899

3:14 So the children 1121 of Israel 3478 served 5647-4 Eglon 5700 the king 4428 of Moab 4124 eighteen 8083 6240 years. 8141

3:15 But when the children 1121 of Israel 3478 cried 2199-4 unto the LORD, 3068 the LORD 3068 raised them up 6965-55 a deliverer, 3467-56 Ehud 164 the son 1121 of Gera, 1617 a Benjamite, 1121 3228 a man 376 lefthanded: 334 3225 3027 and by him 3027 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 sent 7971-4 a present 4503 unto Eglon 5700 the king 4428 of Moab. 4124

3:16 But Ehud 164 made 6213-4 him a dagger 2719 which had two 8147 edges, 6366 of a cubit 1574 length; 753 and he did gird 2296-4 it under his raiment 4055 upon his right 3225 thigh. 3409

3:17 And he brought 7126-55 the present 4503 unto Eglon 5700 king 4428 of Moab: 4124 and Eglon 5700 [was] a very 3966 fat 1277 man. 376

3:18 And when he had made an end 3615-14 to offer 7126-53 the present, 4503 he sent away 7971-17 the people 5971 that bare 5375-6 the present. 4503

3:19 But he himself turned 7725-1 again from the quarries 6456 that [were] by Gilgal, 1537 and said, 559-4 I have a secret 5643 errand 1697 unto thee, O king: 4428 who said, 559-4 Keep silence. 2013-16 And all that stood 5975-6 by him went out 3318-4 from him.

3:20 And Ehud 164 came 935-1 unto him; and he was sitting 3427-6 in a summer 4747 parlour, 5944 which he had for himself alone. And Ehud 164 said, 559-4 I have a message 1697 from God 430 unto thee. And he arose 6965-4 out of [his] seat. 3678

3:21 And Ehud 164 put forth 7971-4 his left 8040 hand, 3027 and took 3947-4 the dagger 2719 from his right 3225 thigh, 3409 and thrust 8628-4 it into his belly: 990

3:22 And the haft 5325 also went in 935-4 after 310 the blade; 3851 and the fat 2459 closed 5462-4 upon 1157 the blade, 3851 so that he could not draw 8025-1 the dagger 2719 out of his belly; 990 and the dirt 6574 came out. 3318-4

3:23 Then Ehud 164 went forth 3318-4 through the porch, 4528 and shut 5462-4 the doors 1817 of the parlour 5944 upon him, and locked 5274-1 them.

3:24 When he was gone out, 3318-1 his servants 5650 came; 935-1 and when they saw 7200-4 that, behold, the doors 1817 of the parlour 5944 [were] locked, 5274-7 they said, 559-4 Surely he covereth 5526-56 his feet 7272 in his summer 4747 chamber. 2315

3:25 And they tarried 2342-4 till they were ashamed: 954-2 and, behold, he opened 6605-6 not the doors 1817 of the parlour; 5944 therefore they took 3947-4 a key, 4668 and opened 6605-4 [them]: and, behold, their lord 113 [was] fallen down 5307-6 dead 4191-5 on the earth. 776

3:26 And Ehud 164 escaped 4422-8 while they tarried, 4102-116 and passed beyond 5674-1 the quarries, 6456 and escaped 4422-11 unto Seirath. 8167

3:27 And it came to pass, when he was come, 935-2 that he blew 8628-4 a trumpet 7782 in the mountain 2022 of Ephraim, 669 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 went down 3381-4 with him from the mount, 2022 and he before 6440 them.

3:28 And he said 559-4 unto them, Follow 7291-3 after 310 me: for the LORD 3068 hath delivered 5414-1 your enemies 341-6 the Moabites 4124 into your hand. 3027 And they went down 3381-4 after 310 him, and took 3920-4 the fords 4569 of Jordan 3383 toward Moab, 4124 and suffered 5414-1 not a man 376 to pass over. 5674-2

3:29 And they slew 5221-55 of Moab 4124 at that time 6256 about ten 6235 thousand 505 men, 376 all lusty, 8082 and all men 376 of valour; 2428 and there escaped 4422-8 not a man. 376

3:30 So Moab 4124 was subdued 3665-11 that day 3117 under the hand 3027 of Israel. 3478 And the land 776 had rest 8252-4 fourscore 8084 years. 8141

3:31 And after 310 him was Shamgar 8044 the son 1121 of Anath, 6067 which slew 5221-55 of the Philistines 6430 six 8337 hundred 3967 men 376 with an ox 1241 goad: 4451 and he also delivered 3467-55 Israel. 3478

4:1 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 again 3254-55 did 6213-2 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 when Ehud 164 was dead. 4191-1

4:2 And the LORD 3068 sold 4376-4 them into the hand 3027 of Jabin 2985 king 4428 of Canaan, 3667 that reigned 4427-1 in Hazor; 2674 the captain 8269 of whose host 6635 [was] Sisera, 5516 which dwelt 3427-6 in Harosheth 2800 of the Gentiles. 1471

4:3 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 cried 6817-4 unto the LORD: 3068 for he had nine 8672 hundred 3967 chariots 7393 of iron; 1270 and twenty 6242 years 8141 he mightily 2393 oppressed 3905-1 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

4:4 And Deborah, 1683 a prophetess, 802 5031 the wife 802 of Lapidoth, 3941 she judged 8199-6 Israel 3478 at that time. 6256

4:5 And she dwelt 3427-6 under the palm tree 8560 of Deborah 1683 between Ramah 7414 and Bethel 1008 in mount 2022 Ephraim: 669 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 came up 5927-4 to her for judgment. 4941

4:6 And she sent 7971-4 and called 7121-4 Barak 1301 the son 1121 of Abinoam 42 out of Kedeshnaphtali, 6943 5321 and said 559-4 unto him, Hath not the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 commanded, 6680-14 [saying], Go 3212-3 and draw 4900-1 toward mount 2022 Tabor, 8396 and take 3947-1 with thee ten 6235 thousand 505 men 376 of the children 1121 of Naphtali 5321 and of the children 1121 of Zebulun? 2074

4:7 And I will draw 4900-1 unto thee to the river 5158 Kishon 7028 Sisera, 5516 the captain 8269 of Jabin's 2985 army, 6635 with his chariots 7393 and his multitude; 1995 and I will deliver 5414-1 him into thine hand. 3027

4:8 And Barak 1301 said 559-4 unto her, If thou wilt go 3212-4 with me, then I will go: 1980-1 but if thou wilt not go 3212-4 with me, [then] I will not go. 3212-4

4:9 And she said, 559-4 I will surely 1980-2 go 3212-4 with thee: notwithstanding 657 the journey 1870 that thou takest 1980-6 shall not be for thine honour; 8597 for the LORD 3068 shall sell 4376-4 Sisera 5516 into the hand 3027 of a woman. 802 And Deborah 1683 arose, 6965-4 and went 3212-4 with Barak 1301 to Kedesh. 6943

4:10 And Barak 1301 called 2199-55 Zebulun 2074 and Naphtali 5321 to Kedesh; 6943 and he went up 5927-4 with ten 6235 thousand 505 men 376 at his feet: 7272 and Deborah 1683 went up 5927-4 with him.

4:11 Now Heber 2268 the Kenite, 7017 [which was] of the children 1121 of Hobab 2246 the father in law 2859-6 of Moses, 4872 had severed 6504-12 himself from the Kenites, 7014 and pitched 5186-4 his tent 168 unto the plain 436 of Zaanaim, 6815 which [is] by Kedesh. 6943

4:12 And they shewed 5046-55 Sisera 5516 that Barak 1301 the son 1121 of Abinoam 42 was gone up 5927-1 to mount 2022 Tabor. 8396

4:13 And Sisera 5516 gathered together 2199-55 all his chariots, 7393 [even] nine 8672 hundred 3967 chariots 7393 of iron, 1270 and all the people 5971 that [were] with him, from Harosheth 2800 of the Gentiles 1471 unto the river 5158 of Kishon. 7028

4:14 And Deborah 1683 said 559-4 unto Barak, 1301 Up; 6965-3 for this [is] the day 3117 in which the LORD 3068 hath delivered 5414-1 Sisera 5516 into thine hand: 3027 is not the LORD 3068 gone out 3318-1 before 6440 thee? So Barak 1301 went down 3381-4 from mount 2022 Tabor, 8396 and ten 6235 thousand 505 men 376 after 310 him.

4:15 And the LORD 3068 discomfited 2000-4 Sisera, 5516 and all [his] chariots, 7393 and all [his] host, 4264 with the edge 6310 of the sword 2719 before 6440 Barak; 1301 so that Sisera 5516 lighted down 3381-4 off [his] chariot, 4818 and fled 5127-4 away on his feet. 7272

4:16 But Barak 1301 pursued 7291-1 after 310 the chariots, 7393 and after 310 the host, 4264 unto Harosheth 2800 of the Gentiles: 1471 and all the host 4264 of Sisera 5516 fell 5307-4 upon the edge 6310 of the sword; 2719 [and] there was not a man 259 left. 7604-8

4:17 Howbeit Sisera 5516 fled away 5127-1 on his feet 7272 to the tent 168 of Jael 3278 the wife 802 of Heber 2268 the Kenite: 7017 for [there was] peace 7965 between Jabin 2985 the king 4428 of Hazor 2674 and the house 1004 of Heber 2268 the Kenite. 7017

4:18 And Jael 3278 went out 3318-4 to meet 7125-2 Sisera, 5516 and said 559-4 unto him, Turn in, 5493-3 my lord, 113 turn in 5493-3 to me; fear 3372-4 not. And when he had turned in 5493-4 unto her into the tent, 168 she covered 3680-17 him with a mantle. 8063

4:19 And he said 559-4 unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little 4592 water 4325 to drink; 8248-54 for I am thirsty. 6770-1 And she opened 6605-4 a bottle 4997 of milk, 2461 and gave him drink, 8248-55 and covered 3680-17 him.

4:20 Again he said 559-4 unto her, Stand 5975-3 in the door 6607 of the tent, 168 and it shall be, when any man 376 doth come 935-4 and enquire 7592-1 of thee, and say, 559-1 Is there 3426 any man 376 here? that thou shalt say, 559-1 No.

4:21 Then Jael 3278 Heber's 2268 wife 802 took 3947-4 a nail 3489 of the tent, 168 and took 7760-4 an hammer 4718 in her hand, 3027 and went 935-4 softly 3814 unto him, and smote 8628-4 the nail 3489 into his temples, 7541 and fastened 6795-4 it into the ground: 776 for he was fast asleep 7290-8 and weary. 5774-4 So he died. 4191-4

4:22 And, behold, as Barak 1301 pursued 7291-6 Sisera, 5516 Jael 3278 came out 3318-4 to meet 7125-2 him, and said 559-4 unto him, Come, 3212-3 and I will shew 7200-55 thee the man 376 whom thou seekest. 1245-18 And when he came 935-4 into her [tent], behold, Sisera 5516 lay 5307-6 dead, 4191-5 and the nail 3489 [was] in his temples. 7541

4:23 So God 430 subdued 3665-55 on that day 3117 Jabin 2985 the king 4428 of Canaan 3667 before 6440 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

4:24 And the hand 3027 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 prospered, 3212-4 1980-2 and prevailed 7186 against Jabin 2985 the king 4428 of Canaan, 3667 until they had destroyed 3772-52 Jabin 2985 king 4428 of Canaan. 3667

5:1 Then sang 7891-4 Deborah 1683 and Barak 1301 the son 1121 of Abinoam 42 on that day, 3117 saying, 559-2

5:2 Praise 1288-16 ye the LORD 3068 for the avenging 6544-2 6546 of Israel, 3478 when the people 5971 willingly offered 5068-99 themselves.

5:3 Hear, 8085-3 O ye kings; 4428 give ear, 238-54 O ye princes; 7336-6 I, [even] I, will sing 7891-4 unto the LORD; 3068 I will sing 2167-17 [praise] to the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel. 3478

5:4 LORD, 3068 when thou wentest out 3318-2 of Seir, 8165 when thou marchedst 6805-2 out of the field 7704 of Edom, 123 the earth 776 trembled, 7493-1 and the heavens 8064 dropped, 5197-1 the clouds 5645 also dropped 5197-1 water. 4325

5:5 The mountains 2022 melted 5140-1 from before 6440 the LORD, 3068 [even] that Sinai 5514 from before 6440 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel. 3478

5:6 In the days 3117 of Shamgar 8044 the son 1121 of Anath, 6067 in the days 3117 of Jael, 3278 the highways 734 were unoccupied, 2308-1 and the travellers 1980-6 5410 walked 3212-4 through byways. 734 6128

5:7 [The inhabitants of] the villages 6520 ceased, 2308-1 they ceased 2308-1 in Israel, 3478 until that I Deborah 1683 arose, 6965-1 that I arose 6965-1 a mother 517 in Israel. 3478

5:8 They chose 977-4 new 2319 gods; 430 then [was] war 3901 in the gates: 8179 was there a shield 4043 or spear 7420 seen 7200-11 among forty 705 thousand 505 in Israel? 3478

5:9 My heart 3820 [is] toward the governors 2710-6 of Israel, 3478 that offered themselves willingly 5068-102 among the people. 5971 Bless 1288-16 ye the LORD. 3068

5:10 Speak, 7878-3 ye that ride 7392-6 on white 6715 asses, 860 ye that sit 3427-6 in judgment, 4055 and walk 1980-6 by the way. 1870

5:11 [They that are delivered] from the noise 6963 of archers 2686-18 in the places of drawing water, 4857 there shall they rehearse 8567-17 the righteous acts 6666 of the LORD, 3068 [even] the righteous acts 6666 [toward the inhabitants] of his villages 6520 in Israel: 3478 then shall the people 5971 of the LORD 3068 go down 3381-1 to the gates. 8179

5:12 Awake, 5782-3 awake, 5782-3 Deborah: 1683 awake, 5782-3 awake, 5782-3 utter 1696-16 a song: 7892 arise, 6965-3 Barak, 1301 and lead thy captivity 7628 captive, 7617-3 thou son 1121 of Abinoam. 42

5:13 Then he made him that remaineth 8300 have dominion 7287-17 over the nobles 117 among the people: 5971 the LORD 3068 made me have dominion 7287-17 over the mighty. 1368

5:14 Out of Ephraim 669 [was there] a root 8328 of them against Amalek; 6002 after 310 thee, Benjamin, 1144 among thy people; 5971 out of Machir 4353 came down 3381-1 governors, 2710-26 and out of Zebulun 2074 they that handle 4900-6 the pen 7626 of the writer. 5608-6

5:15 And the princes 82 9 of Issachar 3485 [were] with Deborah; 1683 even Issachar, 3485 and also Barak: 1301 he was sent 7971-27 on foot 7272 into the valley. 6010 For the divisions 6390 of Reuben 7205 [there were] great 1419 thoughts 2711 of heart. 3820

5:16 Why abodest 3427-1 thou among 996 the sheepfolds, 4942 to hear 8085-2 the bleatings 8292 of the flocks? 5739 For the divisions 6390 of Reuben 7205 [there were] great 1419 searchings 2714 of heart. 3820

5:17 Gilead 1568 abode 7931-1 beyond 5676 Jordan: 3383 and why did Dan 1835 remain 1481-4 in ships? 591 Asher 836 continued 3427-1 on the sea 3220 shore, 2348 and abode 7931-4 in his breaches. 4664

5:18 Zebulun 2074 and Naphtali 5321 [were] a people 5971 [that] jeoparded 2778-14 their lives 5315 unto the death 4191-2 in the high places 4791 of the field. 7704

5:19 The kings 4428 came 935-1 [and] fought, 3898-8 then fought 3898-8 the kings 4428 of Canaan 3667 in Taanach 8590 by the waters 4325 of Megiddo; 4023 they took 3947-1 no gain 1215 of money. 3701

5:20 They fought 3898-8 from heaven; 8064 the stars 3556 in their courses 4546 fought 3898-8 against Sisera. 5516

5:21 The river 5158 of Kishon 7028 swept them away, 1640-1 that ancient 6917 river, 5158 the river 5158 Kishon. 7028 O my soul, 5315 thou hast trodden down 1869-4 strength. 5797

5:22 Then were the horsehoofs 6119 5483 broken 1986-1 by the means of the pransings, 1726 the pransings 1726 of their mighty ones. 47

5:23 Curse 779-3 ye Meroz, 4789 said 559-1 the angel 4397 of the LORD, 3068 curse 779-3 ye bitterly 779-2 the inhabitants 3427-6 thereof; because they came 935-1 not to the help 5833 of the LORD, 3068 to the help 5833 of the LORD 3068 against the mighty. 1368

5:24 Blessed 1288-29 above women 802 shall Jael 3278 the wife 802 of Heber 2268 the Kenite 7017 be, blessed 1288-29 shall she be above women 802 in the tent. 168

5:25 He asked 7592-1 water, 4325 [and] she gave 5414-1 [him] milk; 2461 she brought forth 7126-52 butter 2529 in a lordly 117 dish. 5602

5:26 She put 7971-4 her hand 3027 to the nail, 3489 and her right hand 3225 to the workmen's 6001 hammer; 1989 and with the hammer she smote 1986-1 Sisera, 5516 she smote off 4277-1 his head, 7218 when she had pierced 4272-1 and stricken through 2498-1 his temples. 7541

5:27 At her feet 7272 he bowed, 3766-1 he fell, 5307-1 he lay down: 7901-1 at her feet 7272 he bowed, 3766-1 he fell: 5307-1 where 834 he bowed, 3766-1 there he fell down 5307-1 dead. 7703-7

5:28 The mother 517 of Sisera 5516 looked 8259-8 out at a window, 2474 and cried 2980-17 through the lattice, 822 Why is his chariot 7393 [so] long 954-14 in coming? 935-2 why tarry 309-14 the wheels 6471 of his chariots? 4818

5:29 Her wise 2450 ladies 8282 answered 6030-4 her, yea, she returned 7725-55 answer 561 to herself,

5:30 Have they not sped? 4672-4 have they [not] divided 2505-17 the prey; 7998 to every 7218 man 1397 a damsel 7356 [or] two; 7361 to Sisera 5516 a prey 7998 of divers colours, 6648 a prey 7998 of divers colours 6648 of needlework, 7553 of divers colours 6648 of needlework 7553 on both sides, [meet] for the necks 6677 of [them that take] the spoil? 7998

5:31 So let all thine enemies 341-6 perish, 6-4 O LORD: 3068 but [let] them that love 157-6 him [be] as the sun 8121 when he goeth forth 3318-2 in his might. 1369 And the land 776 had rest 8252-4 forty 705 years. 8141

6:1 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did 6213-4 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD: 3068 and the LORD 3068 delivered 5414-4 them into the hand 3027 of Midian 4080 seven 7651 years. 8141

6:2 And the hand 3027 of Midian 4080 prevailed 5810-4 against Israel: 3478 [and] because 6440 of the Midianites 4080 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 made 6213-1 them the dens 4492 which [are] in the mountains, 2022 and caves, 4631 and strong holds. 4679

6:3 And [so] it was, when Israel 3478 had sown, 2232-1 that the Midianites 4080 came up, 5927-1 and the Amalekites, 6002 and the children 1121 of the east, 6924 even they came up 5927-1 against them;

6:4 And they encamped 2583-4 against them, and destroyed 7843-55 the increase 2981 of the earth, 776 till thou come 935-2 unto Gaza, 5804 and left 7604-55 no sustenance 4241 for Israel, 3478 neither sheep, 7716 nor ox, 7794 nor ass. 2543

6:5 For they came up 5927-4 with their cattle 4735 and their tents, 168 and they came 935-1|935-4-k as 1767 grasshoppers 697 for multitude; 7230 [for] both they and their camels 1581 were without number: 4557 and they entered 935-4 into the land 776 to destroy 7843-15 it.

6:6 And Israel 3478 was greatly 3966 impoverished 1809-11 because 6440 of the Midianites; 4080 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 cried 2199-4 unto the LORD. 3068

6:7 And it came to pass, when the children 1121 of Israel 3478 cried 2199-1 unto the LORD 3068 because 182 of the Midianites, 4080

6:8 That the LORD 3068 sent 7971-4 a prophet 376 5030 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 which said 559-4 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 I brought you up 5927-52 from Egypt, 4714 and brought you forth 3318-55 out of the house 1004 of bondage; 5650

6:9 And I delivered 5337-55 you out of the hand 3027 of the Egyptians, 4714 and out of the hand 3027 of all that oppressed 3905-5 you, and drave them out 1644-17 from before 6440 you, and gave 5414-4 you their land; 776

6:10 And I said 559-4 unto you, I [am] the LORD 3068 your God; 430 fear 3372-4 not the gods 430 of the Amorites, 567 in whose land 776 ye dwell: 3427-6 but ye have not obeyed 8085-1 my voice. 6963

6:11 And there came 935-4 an angel 4397 of the LORD, 3068 and sat 3427-4 under an oak 424 which [was] in Ophrah, 6084 that [pertained] unto Joash 3101 the Abiezrite: 33 and his son 1121 Gideon 1439 threshed 2251-6 wheat 2406 by the winepress, 1660 to hide 5127-53 [it] from 6440 the Midianites. 4080

6:12 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 appeared 7200-11 unto him, and said 559-4 unto him, The LORD 3068 [is] with thee, thou mighty 1368 man of valour. 2428

6:13 And Gideon 1439 said 559-4 unto him, Oh 994 my Lord, 113 if the LORD 3068 be 3426 with us, why then is all this befallen 4672-1 us? and where [be] all his miracles 6381-12 which our fathers 1 told 5608-14 us of, saying, 559-2 Did not the LORD 3068 bring us up 5927-52 from Egypt? 4714 but now the LORD 3068 hath forsaken 5203-1 us, and delivered 5414-4 us into the hands 3709 of the Midianites. 4080

6:14 And the LORD 3068 looked 6437-4 upon him, and said, 559-4 Go 3212-3 in this thy might, 3581 and thou shalt save 3467-52 Israel 3478 from the hand 3709 of the Midianites: 4080 have not I sent 7971-1 thee?

6:15 And he said 559-4 unto him, Oh 994 my Lord, 136 wherewith 4100 shall I save 3467-55 Israel? 3478 behold, my family 504|505-q [is] poor 1800 in Manasseh, 4519 and I [am] the least 6810 in my father's 1 house. 1004

6:16 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite 5221-52 the Midianites 4080 as one 259 man. 376

6:17 And he said 559-4 unto him, If now I have found 4672-1 grace 2580 in thy sight, 5869 then shew 6213-1 me a sign 226 that thou talkest 1696-18 with me.

6:18 Depart 4185-4 not hence, I pray thee, until I come 935-2 unto thee, and bring forth 3318-52 my present, 4503 and set 3240-52 [it] before 6440 thee. And he said, 559-4 I will tarry 3427-4 until thou come again. 7725-2

6:19 And Gideon 1439 went in, 935-1 and made ready 6213-4 a kid, 5795 1423 and unleavened cakes 4682 of an ephah 374 of flour: 7058 the flesh 1320 he put 7760-1 in a basket, 5536 and he put 7760-1 the broth 4839 in a pot, 6517 and brought [it] out 3318-55 unto him under the oak, 424 and presented 5066-55 [it].

6:20 And the angel 4397 of God 430 said 559-4 unto him, Take 3947-3 the flesh 1320 and the unleavened cakes, 4682 and lay 3240-54 [them] upon this 1975 rock, 5553 and pour out 8210-3 the broth. 4839 And he did 6213-4 so.

6:21 Then the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 put forth 7971-4 the end 7097 of the staff 4938 that [was] in his hand, 3027 and touched 5060-4 the flesh 1320 and the unleavened cakes; 4682 and there rose up 5927-4 fire 784 out of the rock, 6697 and consumed 398-4 the flesh 1320 and the unleavened cakes. 4682 Then the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 departed 1980-1 out of his sight. 5869

6:22 And when Gideon 1439 perceived 7200-4 that he [was] an angel 4397 of the LORD, 3068 Gideon 1439 said, 559-4 Alas, 162 O Lord 136 GOD! 3069 for because 3651 I have seen 7200-1 an angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 face 6440 to face. 6440

6:23 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, Peace 7965 [be] unto thee; fear 3372-4 not: thou shalt not die. 4191-4

6:24 Then Gideon 1439 built 1129-4 an altar 4196 there unto the LORD, 3068 and called 7121-4 it Jehovahshalom: 3068|7965|3073 unto this day 3117 it [is] yet in Ophrah 6084 of the Abiezrites. 33

6:25 And it came to pass the same night, 3915 that the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, Take 3947-3 thy father's 1 young 6499 bullock, 7794 even the second 8145 bullock 6499 of seven 7651 years 8141 old, and throw down 2040-1 the altar 4196 of Baal 1168 that thy father 1 hath, and cut down 3772-4 the grove 842 that [is] by it:

6:26 And build 1129-1 an altar 4196 unto the LORD 3068 thy God 430 upon the top 7218 of this rock, 4581 in the ordered place, 4634 and take 3947-1 the second 8145 bullock, 6499 and offer 5927-52 a burnt sacrifice 5930 with the wood 6086 of the grove 842 which thou shalt cut down. 3772-4

6:27 Then Gideon 1439 took 3947-4 ten 6235 men 582 of his servants, 5650 and did 6213-4 as the LORD 3068 had said 1696-14 unto him: and [so] it was, because he feared 3372-1 his father's 1 household, 1004 and the men 582 of the city, 5892 that he could not do 6213-2 [it] by day, 3119 that he did 6213-4 [it] by night. 3915

6:28 And when the men 582 of the city 5892 arose early 7925-55 in the morning, 1242 behold, the altar 4196 of Baal 1168 was cast down, 5422-27 and the grove 842 was cut down 3772-27 that [was] by it, and the second 8145 bullock 6499 was offered 5927-90 upon the altar 4196 [that was] built. 1129-7

6:29 And they said 559-4 one 376 to another, 7453 Who hath done 6213-1 this thing? 1697 And when they enquired 1875-4 and asked, 1245-17 they said, 559-4 Gideon 1439 the son 1121 of Joash 3101 hath done 6213-1 this thing. 1697

6:30 Then the men 582 of the city 5892 said 559-4 unto Joash, 3101 Bring out 3318-54 thy son, 1121 that he may die: 4191-4 because he hath cast down 5422-1 the altar 4196 of Baal, 1168 and because he hath cut down 3772-1 the grove 842 that [was] by it.

6:31 And Joash 3101 said 559-4 unto all that stood 5975-1 against him, Will ye plead 7378-4 for Baal? 1168 will ye save 3467-55 him? he that will plead 7378-4 for him, let him be put to death 4191-93 whilst [it is yet] morning: 1242 if he [be] a god, 430 let him plead 7378-4 for himself, because [one] hath cast down 5422-1 his altar. 4196

6:32 Therefore on that day 3117 he called 7121-4 him Jerubbaal, 3378 saying, 559-2 Let Baal 1168 plead 7378-4 against him, because he hath thrown down 5422-1 his altar. 4196

6:33 Then all the Midianites 4080 and the Amalekites 6002 and the children 1121 of the east 6924 were gathered 622-8 together, 3162 and went over, 5674-4 and pitched 2583-4 in the valley 6010 of Jezreel. 3157

6:34 But the Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 came upon 3847-1 Gideon, 1439 and he blew 8628-4 a trumpet; 7782 and Abiezer 44 was gathered 2199-11 after 310 him.

6:35 And he sent 7971-1 messengers 4397 throughout all Manasseh; 4519 who also was gathered 2199-11 after 310 him: and he sent 7971-1 messengers 4397 unto Asher, 836 and unto Zebulun, 2074 and unto Naphtali; 5321 and they came up 5927-4 to meet 7125-2 them.

6:36 And Gideon 1439 said 559-4 unto God, 430 If thou wilt 3426 save 3467-56 Israel 3478 by mine hand, 3027 as thou hast said, 1696-14

6:37 Behold, I will put 3322-56 a fleece 1492 of wool 6785 in the floor; 1637 [and] if the dew 2919 be on the fleece 1492 only, and [it be] dry 2721 upon all the earth 776 [beside], then shall I know 3045-1 that thou wilt save 3467-55 Israel 3478 by mine hand, 3027 as thou hast said. 1696-14

6:38 And it was so: for he rose up early 7925-55 on the morrow, 4283 and thrust the fleece 1492 together, 2115-4 and wringed 4680-4 the dew 2919 out of the fleece, 1492 a bowl 5602 full 4393 of water. 4325

6:39 And Gideon 1439 said 559-4 unto God, 430 Let not thine anger 639 be hot 2734-4 against me, and I will speak 1696-17 but this once: 6471 let me prove, 5254-17 I pray thee, but this once 6471 with the fleece; 1492 let it now be dry 2721 only upon the fleece, 1492 and upon all the ground 776 let there be dew. 2919

6:40 And God 430 did 6213-4 so that night: 3915 for it was dry 2721 upon the fleece 1492 only, and there was dew 2919 on all the ground. 776

7:1 Then Jerubbaal, 3378 who [is] Gideon, 1439 and all the people 5971 that [were] with him, rose up early, 7925-55 and pitched 2583-4 beside the well of Harod: 5878 so that the host 4264 of the Midianites 4080 were on the north 6828 side of them, by the hill 1389 of Moreh, 4176 in the valley. 6010

7:2 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Gideon, 1439 The people 5971 that [are] with thee [are] too many 7227 for me to give 5414-2 the Midianites 4080 into their hands, 3027 lest Israel 3478 vaunt 6286-101 themselves against me, saying, 559-2 Mine own hand 3027 hath saved 3467-52 me.

7:3 Now therefore go to, 4994 proclaim 7121-3 in the ears 241 of the people, 5971 saying, 559-2 Whosoever [is] fearful 3373 and afraid, 2730 let him return 7725-4 and depart early 6852-4 from mount 2022 Gilead. 1568 And there returned 7725-4 of the people 5971 twenty 6242 and two 8147 thousand; 505 and there remained 7604-8 ten 6235 thousand. 505

7:4 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Gideon, 1439 The people 5971 [are] yet [too] many; 7227 bring them down 3381-54 unto the water, 4325 and I will try 6884-4 them for thee there: and it shall be, [that] of whom I say 559-4 unto thee, This shall go 3212-4 with thee, the same shall go 3212-4 with thee; and of whomsoever I say 559-4 unto thee, This shall not go 3212-4 with thee, the same shall not go. 3212-4

7:5 So he brought down 3381-55 the people 5971 unto the water: 4325 and the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Gideon, 1439 Every one that lappeth 3952-4 of the water 4325 with his tongue, 3956 as a dog 3611 lappeth, 3952-4 him shalt thou set 3322-55 by himself; likewise every one that boweth down 3766-4 upon his knees 1290 to drink. 8354-2

7:6 And the number 4557 of them that lapped, 3952-18 [putting] their hand 3027 to their mouth, 6310 were three 7969 hundred 3967 men: 376 but all the rest 3499 of the people 5971 bowed down 3766-1 upon their knees 1290 to drink 8354-2 water. 4325

7:7 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Gideon, 1439 By the three 7969 hundred 3967 men 376 that lapped 3952-18 will I save 3467-55 you, and deliver 5414-1 the Midianites 4080 into thine hand: 3027 and let all the [other] people 5971 go 3212-4 every man 376 unto his place. 4725

7:8 So the people 5971 took 3947-4 victuals 6720 in their hand, 3027 and their trumpets: 7782 and he sent 7971-14 all 376 [the rest of] Israel 3478 every man 376 unto his tent, 168 and retained 2388-52 those three 7969 hundred 3967 men: 376 and the host 4264 of Midian 4080 was beneath him in the valley. 6010

7:9 And it came to pass the same night, 3915 that the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, Arise, 6965-3 get thee down 3381-3 unto the host; 4264 for I have delivered 5414-1 it into thine hand. 3027

7:10 But if thou fear 3373 to go down, 3381-2 go thou with Phurah 6513 thy servant 5288 down 3381-3 to the host: 4264

7:11 And thou shalt hear 8085-1 what they say; 1696-17 and afterward 310 shall thine hands 3027 be strengthened 2388-4 to go down 3381-1 unto the host. 4264 Then went he down 3381-4 with Phurah 6513 his servant 5288 unto the outside 7097 of the armed men 2571 that [were] in the host. 4264

7:12 And the Midianites 4080 and the Amalekites 6002 and all the children 1121 of the east 6924 lay 5307-6 along in the valley 6010 like grasshoppers 697 for multitude; 7230 and their camels 1581 [were] without number, 4557 as the sand 2344 by the sea 3220 side 8193 for multitude. 7230

7:13 And when Gideon 1439 was come, 935-4 behold, [there was] a man 376 that told 5608-18 a dream 2472 unto his fellow, 7453 and said, 559-4 Behold, I dreamed 2492-1 a dream, 2472 and, lo, a cake 6742|6742-k of barley 8184 bread 3899 tumbled 2015-102 into the host 4264 of Midian, 4080 and came 935-4 unto a tent, 168 and smote 5221-55 it that it fell, 5307-4 and overturned 2015-4 it, 4605 that the tent 168 lay along. 5307-1

7:14 And his fellow 7453 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 This [is] nothing else save the sword 2719 of Gideon 1439 the son 1121 of Joash, 3101 a man 376 of Israel: 3478 [for] into his hand 3027 hath God 430 delivered 5414-1 Midian, 4080 and all the host. 4264

7:15 And it was [so], when Gideon 1439 heard 8085-2 the telling 4557 of the dream, 2472 and the interpretation 7667 thereof, that he worshipped, 7812-101 and returned 7725-4 into the host 4264 of Israel, 3478 and said, 559-4 Arise; 6965-3 for the LORD 3068 hath delivered 5414-1 into your hand 3027 the host 4264 of Midian. 4080

7:16 And he divided 2673-4 the three 7969 hundred 3967 men 376 [into] three 7969 companies, 7218 and he put 5414-4 a trumpet 7782 in every man's hand, 3027 with empty 7386 pitchers, 3537 and lamps 3940 within 8432 the pitchers. 3537

7:17 And he said 559-4 unto them, Look 7200-4 on me, and do 6213-4 likewise: and, behold, when I come 935-6 to the outside 7097 of the camp, 4264 it shall be [that], as I do, 6213-4 so shall ye do. 6213-4

7:18 When I blow 8628-1 with a trumpet, 7782 I and all that [are] with me, then blow 8628-1 ye the trumpets 7782 also on every side 5439 of all the camp, 4264 and say, 559-1 [The sword] of the LORD, 3068 and of Gideon. 1439

7:19 So Gideon, 1439 and the hundred 3967 men 376 that [were] with him, came 935-4 unto the outside 7097 of the camp 4264 in the beginning 7218 of the middle 8484 watch; 821 and they had but 389 newly 6965-53 set 6965-52 the watch: 8104-6 and they blew 8628-4 the trumpets, 7782 and brake 5310-2 the pitchers 3537 that [were] in their hands. 3027

7:20 And the three 7969 companies 7218 blew 8628-4 the trumpets, 7782 and brake 7665-4 the pitchers, 3537 and held 2388-55 the lamps 3940 in their left 8040 hands, 3027 and the trumpets 7782 in their right 3225 hands 3027 to blow 8628-2 [withal]: and they cried, 7121-4 The sword 2719 of the LORD, 3068 and of Gideon. 1439

7:21 And they stood 5975-4 every man 376 in his place round about 5439 the camp: 4264 and all the host 4264 ran, 7323-4 and cried, 7321-55 and fled. 5127-4|5127-55-k

7:22 And the three 7969 hundred 3967 blew 8628-4 the trumpets, 7782 and the LORD 3068 set 7760-4 every man's 376 sword 2719 against his fellow, 7453 even throughout all the host: 4264 and the host 4264 fled 5127-4 to Bethshittah 1029 in Zererath, 6888 [and] to the border 8193 of Abelmeholah, 65 unto Tabbath. 2888

7:23 And the men 376 of Israel 3478 gathered themselves together 6817-11 out of Naphtali, 5321 and out of Asher, 836 and out of all Manasseh, 4519 and pursued 7291-4 after 310 the Midianites. 4080

7:24 And Gideon 1439 sent 7971-1 messengers 4397 throughout all mount 2022 Ephraim, 669 saying, 559-2 Come down 3381-3 against 7125-2 the Midianites, 4080 and take 3920-3 before them the waters 4325 unto Bethbarah 1012 and Jordan. 3383 Then all the men 376 of Ephraim 669 gathered themselves together, 6817-11 and took 3920-4 the waters 4325 unto Bethbarah 1012 and Jordan. 3383

7:25 And they took 3920-4 two 8147 princes 8269 of the Midianites, 4080 Oreb 6159 and Zeeb; 2062 and they slew 2026-4 Oreb 6159 upon the rock 6697 Oreb, 6159 and Zeeb 2062 they slew 2026-1 at the winepress 3342 of Zeeb, 2062 and pursued 7291-4 Midian, 4080 and brought 935-52 the heads 7218 of Oreb 6159 and Zeeb 2062 to Gideon 1439 on the other side 5676 Jordan. 3383

8:1 And the men 376 of Ephraim 669 said 559-4 unto him, Why 4100 hast thou served 6213-1 us thus, 1697 that thou calledst 7121-2 us not, when thou wentest 1980-1 to fight 3898-9 with the Midianites? 4080 And they did chide 7378-4 with him sharply. 2393

8:2 And he said 559-4 unto them, What have I done 6213-1 now in comparison of you? [Is] not the gleaning 5955 of the grapes of Ephraim 669 better 2896 than the vintage 1210 of Abiezer? 44

8:3 God 430 hath delivered 5414-1 into your hands 3027 the princes 8269 of Midian, 4080 Oreb 6159 and Zeeb: 2062 and what was I able 3201-1 to do 6213-2 in comparison of you? Then their anger 7307 was abated 7503-1 toward him, when he had said 1696-15 that. 1697

8:4 And Gideon 1439 came 935-4 to Jordan, 3383 [and] passed over, 5674-6 he, and the three 7969 hundred 3967 men 376 that [were] with him, faint, 5889 yet pursuing 7291-6 [them].

8:5 And he said 559-4 unto the men 582 of Succoth, 5523 Give, 5414-3 I pray you, loaves 3603 of bread 3899 unto the people 5971 that follow 7272 me; for they [be] faint, 5889 and I am pursuing 7291-6 after 310 Zebah 2078 and Zalmunna, 6759 kings 4428 of Midian. 4080

8:6 And the princes 8269 of Succoth 5523 said, 559-4 [Are] the hands 3709 of Zebah 2078 and Zalmunna 6759 now in thine hand, 3027 that we should give 5414-4 bread 3899 unto thine army? 6635

8:7 And Gideon 1439 said, 559-4 Therefore when the LORD 3068 hath delivered 5414-2 Zebah 2078 and Zalmunna 6759 into mine hand, 3027 then I will tear 1758-1 your flesh 1320 with the thorns 6975 of the wilderness 4057 and with briers. 1303

8:8 And he went up 5927-4 thence to Penuel, 6439 and spake 1696-17 unto them likewise: 2063 and the men 582 of Penuel 6439 answered 6030-4 him as the men 582 of Succoth 5523 had answered 6030-1 [him].

8:9 And he spake 559-4 also unto the men 582 of Penuel, 6439 saying, 559-2 When I come again 7725-2 in peace, 7965 I will break down 5422-4 this tower. 4026

8:10 Now Zebah 2078 and Zalmunna 6759 [were] in Karkor, 7174 and their hosts 4264 with them, about fifteen 2568 6240 thousand 505 [men], all that were left 3498-12 of all the hosts 4264 of the children 1121 of the east: 6924 for there fell 5307-6 an hundred 3967 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 men 376 that drew 8025-6 sword. 2719

8:11 And Gideon 1439 went up 5927-4 by the way 1870 of them that dwelt 7931-7 in tents 168 on the east 6924 of Nobah 5025 and Jogbehah, 3011 and smote 5221-55 the host: 4264 for the host 4264 was secure. 983

8:12 And when Zebah 2078 and Zalmunna 6759 fled, 5127-4 he pursued 7291-4 after 310 them, and took 3920-4 the two 8147 kings 4428 of Midian, 4080 Zebah 2078 and Zalmunna, 6759 and discomfited 2729-52 all the host. 4264

8:13 And Gideon 1439 the son 1121 of Joash 3101 returned 7725-4 from battle 4421 before 4608 the sun 2775 [was up],

8:14 And caught 3920-4 a young man 5288 of the men 582 of Succoth, 5523 and enquired 7592-4 of him: and he described 3789-4 unto him the princes 8269 of Succoth, 5523 and the elders 2205 thereof, [even] threescore and seventeen 7657 7651 men. 376

8:15 And he came 935-4 unto the men 582 of Succoth, 5523 and said, 559-4 Behold Zebah 2078 and Zalmunna, 6759 with whom ye did upbraid 2778-14 me, saying, 559-2 [Are] the hands 3709 of Zebah 2078 and Zalmunna 6759 now in thine hand, 3027 that we should give 5414-4 bread 3899 unto thy men 582 [that are] weary? 3287

8:16 And he took 3947-4 the elders 2205 of the city, 5892 and thorns 6975 of the wilderness 4057 and briers, 1303 and with them he taught 3045-55 the men 582 of Succoth. 5523

8:17 And he beat down 5422-1 the tower 4026 of Penuel, 6439 and slew 2026-4 the men 582 of the city. 5892

8:18 Then said 559-4 he unto Zebah 2078 and Zalmunna, 6759 What manner 375 of men 582 [were they] whom ye slew 2026-1 at Tabor? 8396 And they answered, 559-4 As thou 3644 [art], so [were] they; 3644 each one 259 resembled 8389 the children 1121 of a king. 4428

8:19 And he said, 559-4 They [were] my brethren, 251 [even] the sons 1121 of my mother: 517 [as] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 if 3863 ye had saved them alive, 2421-52 I would not slay 2026-1 you.

8:20 And he said 559-4 unto Jether 3500 his firstborn, 1060 Up, 6965-3 [and] slay 2026-3 them. But the youth 5288 drew 8025-1 not his sword: 2719 for he feared, 3372-1 because he [was] yet a youth. 5288

8:21 Then Zebah 2078 and Zalmunna 6759 said, 559-4 Rise 6965-3 thou, and fall 6293-3 upon us: for as the man 376 [is, so is] his strength. 1369 And Gideon 1439 arose, 6965-4 and slew 2026-4 Zebah 2078 and Zalmunna, 6759 and took away 3947-4 the ornaments 7720 that [were] on their camels' 1581 necks. 6677

8:22 Then the men 376 of Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto Gideon, 1439 Rule 4910-3 thou over us, both thou, and thy son, 1121 and thy son's 1121 son 1121 also: for thou hast delivered 3467-52 us from the hand 3027 of Midian. 4080

8:23 And Gideon 1439 said 559-4 unto them, I will not rule 4910-4 over you, neither shall my son 1121 rule 4910-4 over you: the LORD 3068 shall rule 4910-4 over you.

8:24 And Gideon 1439 said 559-4 unto them, I would desire 7592-4 a request 7596 of you, that ye would give 5414-3 me every man 376 the earrings 5141 of his prey. 7998 (For they had golden 2091 earrings, 5141 because they [were] Ishmaelites.) 3459

8:25 And they answered, 559-4 We will willingly 5414-2 give 5414-4 [them]. And they spread 6566-4 a garment, 8071 and did cast 7993-55 therein every man 376 the earrings 5141 of his prey. 7998

8:26 And the weight 4948 of the golden 2091 earrings 5141 that he requested 7592-1 was a thousand 505 and seven 7651 hundred 3967 [shekels] of gold; 2091 beside ornaments, 7720 and collars, 5188 and purple 713 raiment 899 that [was] on the kings 4428 of Midian, 4080 and beside the chains 6060 that [were] about their camels' 1581 necks. 6677

8:27 And Gideon 1439 made 6213-4 an ephod 646 thereof, and put 3322-55 it in his city, 5892 [even] in Ophrah: 6084 and all Israel 3478 went thither a whoring 2181-4 after 310 it: which thing became a snare 4170 unto Gideon, 1439 and to his house. 1004

8:28 Thus was Midian 4080 subdued 3665-11 before 6440 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 so that they lifted up 5375-2 their heads 7218 no more. 3254-1 And the country 776 was in quietness 8252-4 forty 705 years 8141 in the days 3117 of Gideon. 1439

8:29 And Jerubbaal 3378 the son 1121 of Joash 3101 went 3212-4 and dwelt 3427-4 in his own house. 1004

8:30 And Gideon 1439 had threescore and ten 7657 sons 1121 of his body 3409 begotten: 3318-6 for he had many 7227 wives. 802

8:31 And his concubine 6370 that [was] in Shechem, 7927 she also bare 3205-1 him a son, 1121 whose name 8034 he called 7760-4 Abimelech. 40

8:32 And Gideon 1439 the son 1121 of Joash 3101 died 4191-4 in a good 2896 old age, 7872 and was buried 6912-11 in the sepulchre 6913 of Joash 3101 his father, 1 in Ophrah 6084 of the Abiezrites. 33

8:33 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon 1439 was dead, 4191-1 that the children 1121 of Israel 3478 turned again, 7725-4 and went a whoring 2181-4 after 310 Baalim, 1168 and made 7760-4 Baalberith 1170 their god. 430

8:34 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 remembered 2142-1 not the LORD 3068 their God, 430 who had delivered 5337-56 them out of the hands 3027 of all their enemies 341-6 on every side: 5439

8:35 Neither shewed 6213-1 they kindness 2617 to the house 1004 of Jerubbaal, 3378 [namely], Gideon, 1439 according to all the goodness 2896 which he had shewed 6213-1 unto Israel. 3478

9:1 And Abimelech 40 the son 1121 of Jerubbaal 3378 went 3212-4 to Shechem 7927 unto his mother's 517 brethren, 251 and communed 1696-17 with them, and with all the family 4940 of the house 1004 of his mother's 517 father, 1 saying, 559-2

9:2 Speak, 1696-16 I pray you, in the ears 241 of all the men 1167 of Shechem, 7927 Whether [is] better 2896 for you, either that all the sons 1121 of Jerubbaal, 3378 [which are] threescore and ten 7657 persons, 376 reign 4910-2 over you, or that one 259 376 reign 4910-2 over you? remember 2142-1 also that I [am] your bone 6106 and your flesh. 1320

9:3 And his mother's 517 brethren 251 spake 1696-17 of him in the ears 241 of all the men 1167 of Shechem 7927 all these words: 1697 and their hearts 3820 inclined 5186-4 to follow 310 Abimelech; 40 for they said, 559-1 He [is] our brother. 251

9:4 And they gave 5414-4 him threescore and ten 7657 [pieces] of silver 3701 out of the house 1004 of Baalberith, 1170 wherewith Abimelech 40 hired 7936-4 vain 7386 and light 6348-6 persons, 582 which followed 3212-4 310 him.

9:5 And he went 935-4 unto his father's 1 house 1004 at Ophrah, 6084 and slew 2026-4 his brethren 251 the sons 1121 of Jerubbaal, 3378 [being] threescore and ten 7657 persons, 376 upon one 259 stone: 68 notwithstanding yet Jotham 3147 the youngest 6996 son 1121 of Jerubbaal 3378 was left; 3498-11 for he hid 2244-8 himself.

9:6 And all the men 1167 of Shechem 7927 gathered 622-11 together, and all the house 1004 of Millo, 4407 and went, 3212-4 and made 4427-55 Abimelech 40 king, 4428 by the plain 436 of the pillar 5324-94 that [was] in Shechem. 7927

9:7 And when they told 5046-55 [it] to Jotham, 3147 he went 3212-4 and stood 5975-4 in the top 7218 of mount 2022 Gerizim, 1630 and lifted up 5375-4 his voice, 6963 and cried, 7121-4 and said 559-4 unto them, Hearken 8085-3 unto me, ye men 1167 of Shechem, 7927 that God 430 may hearken 8085-4 unto you.

9:8 The trees 6086 went 1980-1 forth 1980-2 [on a time] to anoint 4886-2 a king 4428 over them; and they said 559-4 unto the olive tree, 2132 Reign 4427-3 thou over us.

9:9 But the olive tree 2132 said 559-4 unto them, Should I leave 2308-1 my fatness, 1880 wherewith by me they honour 3513-17 God 430 and man, 582 and go 1980-1 to be promoted 5128-2 over the trees? 6086

9:10 And the trees 6086 said 559-4 to the fig tree, 8384 Come 3212-3 thou, [and] reign 4427-3 over us.

9:11 But the fig tree 8384 said 559-4 unto them, Should I forsake 2308-1 my sweetness, 4987 and my good 2896 fruit, 8570 and go 1980-1 to be promoted 5128-2 over the trees? 6086

9:12 Then said 559-4 the trees 6086 unto the vine, 1612 Come 3212-3 thou, [and] reign 4427-3 over us.

9:13 And the vine 1612 said 559-4 unto them, Should I leave 2308-1 my wine, 8492 which cheereth 8055-18 God 430 and man, 582 and go 1980-1 to be promoted 5128-2 over the trees? 6086

9:14 Then said 559-4 all the trees 6086 unto the bramble, 329 Come 3212-3 thou, [and] reign 4427-3 over us.

9:15 And the bramble 329 said 559-4 unto the trees, 6086 If in truth 571 ye anoint 4886-6 me king 4428 over you, [then] come 935-3 [and] put your trust 2620-3 in my shadow: 6738 and if not, let fire 784 come out 3318-4 of the bramble, 329 and devour 398-4 the cedars 730 of Lebanon. 3844

9:16 Now therefore, if ye have done 6213-1 truly 571 and sincerely, 8549 in that ye have made Abimelech 40 king, 4427-55 and if ye have dealt 6213-1 well 2896 with Jerubbaal 3378 and his house, 1004 and have done 6213-1 unto him according to the deserving 1576 of his hands; 3027

9:17 (For my father 1 fought 3898-8 for you, and adventured 7993-55 his life 5315 far, 5048 and delivered 5337-55 you out of the hand 3027 of Midian: 4080

9:18 And ye are risen up 6965-1 against my father's 1 house 1004 this day, 3117 and have slain 2026-4 his sons, 1121 threescore and ten 7657 persons, 376 upon one 259 stone, 68 and have made Abimelech, 40 the son 1121 of his maidservant, 519 king 4427-55 over the men 1167 of Shechem, 7927 because he [is] your brother;) 251

9:19 If ye then have dealt 6213-1 truly 571 and sincerely 8549 with Jerubbaal 3378 and with his house 1004 this day, 3117 [then] rejoice 8055-3 ye in Abimelech, 40 and let him also rejoice 8055-4 in you:

9:20 But if not, let fire 784 come out 3318-4 from Abimelech, 40 and devour 398-4 the men 1167 of Shechem, 7927 and the house 1004 of Millo; 4407 and let fire 784 come out 3318-4 from the men 1167 of Shechem, 7927 and from the house 1004 of Millo, 4407 and devour 398-4 Abimelech. 40

9:21 And Jotham 3147 ran away, 5127-4 and fled, 1272-4 and went 3212-4 to Beer, 876 and dwelt 3427-4 there, for fear 6440 of Abimelech 40 his brother. 251

9:22 When Abimelech 40 had reigned 7786-4 three 7969 years 8141 over Israel, 3478

9:23 Then God 430 sent 7971-4 an evil 7451 spirit 7307 between Abimelech 40 and the men 1167 of Shechem; 7927 and the men 1167 of Shechem 7927 dealt treacherously 898-4 with Abimelech: 40

9:24 That the cruelty 2555 [done] to the threescore and ten 7657 sons 1121 of Jerubbaal 3378 might come, 935-2 and their blood 1818 be laid 7760-2 upon Abimelech 40 their brother, 251 which slew 2026-1 them; and upon the men 1167 of Shechem, 7927 which aided 2388-14 him 3027 in the killing 2026-2 of his brethren. 251

9:25 And the men 1167 of Shechem 7927 set 7760-4 liers in wait 693-18 for him in the top 7218 of the mountains, 2022 and they robbed 1497-4 all that came 5674-4 along that way 1870 by them: and it was told 5046-93 Abimelech. 40

9:26 And Gaal 1603 the son 1121 of Ebed 5651 came 935-4 with his brethren, 251 and went over 5674-4 to Shechem: 7927 and the men 1167 of Shechem 7927 put their confidence 982-4 in him.

9:27 And they went out 3318-4 into the fields, 7704 and gathered 1219-4 their vineyards, 3754 and trode 1869-4 [the grapes], and made 6213-4 merry, 1974 and went 935-4 into the house 1004 of their god, 430 and did eat 398-4 and drink, 8354-4 and cursed 7043-17 Abimelech. 40

9:28 And Gaal 1603 the son 1121 of Ebed 5651 said, 559-4 Who [is] Abimelech, 40 and who [is] Shechem, 7927 that we should serve 5647-4 him? [is] not [he] the son 1121 of Jerubbaal? 3378 and Zebul 2083 his officer? 6496 serve 5647-3 the men 582 of Hamor 2544 the father 1 of Shechem: 7927 for why should we serve 5647-4 him?

9:29 And would to God 5414-4 this people 5971 were under my hand! 3027 then would I remove 5493-55 Abimelech. 40 And he said 559-4 to Abimelech, 40 Increase 7235-16 thine army, 6635 and come out. 3318-3

9:30 And when Zebul 2083 the ruler 8269 of the city 5892 heard 8085-4 the words 1697 of Gaal 1603 the son 1121 of Ebed, 5651 his anger 639 was kindled. 2734-4

9:31 And he sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 unto Abimelech 40 privily, 8649 saying, 559-2 Behold, Gaal 1603 the son 1121 of Ebed 5651 and his brethren 251 be come 935-6 to Shechem; 7927 and, behold, they fortify 6696-6 the city 5892 against thee.

9:32 Now therefore up 6965-3 by night, 3915 thou and the people 5971 that [is] with thee, and lie in wait 693-3 in the field: 7704

9:33 And it shall be, [that] in the morning, 1242 as soon as the sun 8121 is up, 2224-2 thou shalt rise early, 7925-55 and set 6584-1 upon the city: 5892 and, behold, [when] he and the people 5971 that [is] with him come out 3318-6 against thee, then mayest thou do 6213-1 to them as thou 3027 shalt find 4672-4 occasion.

9:34 And Abimelech 40 rose up, 6965-4 and all the people 5971 that [were] with him, by night, 3915 and they laid wait 693-4 against Shechem 7927 in four 702 companies. 7218

9:35 And Gaal 1603 the son 1121 of Ebed 5651 went out, 3318-4 and stood 5975-4 in the entering 6607 of the gate 8179 of the city: 5892 and Abimelech 40 rose up, 6965-4 and the people 5971 that [were] with him, from lying in wait. 3993

9:36 And when Gaal 1603 saw 7200-4 the people, 5971 he said 559-4 to Zebul, 2083 Behold, there come people 5971 down 3381-6 from the top 7218 of the mountains. 2022 And Zebul 2083 said 559-4 unto him, Thou seest 7200-6 the shadow 6738 of the mountains 2022 as [if they were] men. 582

9:37 And Gaal 1603 spake 1696-15 again 3254-55 and said, 559-4 See there come people 5971 down 3381-6 by the middle 2872 of the land, 776 and another 259 company 7218 come 935-1 along by 1870 the plain 436 of Meonenim. 6049-26

9:38 Then said 559-4 Zebul 2083 unto him, Where [is] now 645 thy mouth, 6310 wherewith thou saidst, 559-4 Who [is] Abimelech, 40 that we should serve 5647-4 him? [is] not this the people 5971 that thou hast despised? 3988-1 go out, 3318-3 I pray 4994 now, and fight 3898-10 with them.

9:39 And Gaal 1603 went out 3318-4 before 6440 the men 1167 of Shechem, 7927 and fought 3898-11 with Abimelech. 40

9:40 And Abimelech 40 chased 7291-4 him, and he fled 5127-4 before 6440 him, and many 7227 were overthrown 5307-4 [and] wounded, 2491 [even] unto the entering 6607 of the gate. 8179

9:41 And Abimelech 40 dwelt 3427-4 at Arumah: 725 and Zebul 2083 thrust out 1644-17 Gaal 1603 and his brethren, 251 that they should not dwell 3427-2 in Shechem. 7927

9:42 And it came to pass on the morrow, 4283 that the people 5971 went out 3318-4 into the field; 7704 and they told 5046-55 Abimelech. 40

9:43 And he took 3947-4 the people, 5971 and divided 2673-4 them into three 7969 companies, 7218 and laid wait 693-4 in the field, 7704 and looked, 7200-4 and, behold, the people 5971 [were] come forth 3318-6 out of the city; 5892 and he rose up 6965-4 against them, and smote 5221-55 them.

9:44 And Abimelech, 40 and the company 7218 that [was] with him, rushed 6584-1 forward, and stood 5975-4 in the entering 6607 of the gate 8179 of the city: 5892 and the two 8147 [other] companies 7218 ran upon 6584-1 all [the people] that [were] in the fields, 7704 and slew 5221-55 them.

9:45 And Abimelech 40 fought 3898-8 against the city 5892 all that day; 3117 and he took 3920-4 the city, 5892 and slew 2026-1 the people 5971 that [was] therein, and beat down 5422-4 the city, 5892 and sowed 2232-4 it with salt. 4417

9:46 And when all the men 1167 of the tower 4026 of Shechem 7927 heard 8085-4 [that], they entered 935-4 into an hold 6877 of the house 1004 of the god 410 Berith. 1286

9:47 And it was told 5046-93 Abimelech, 40 that all the men 1167 of the tower 4026 of Shechem 7927 were gathered together. 6908-98

9:48 And Abimelech 40 gat him up 5927-4 to mount 2022 Zalmon, 6756 he and all the people 5971 that [were] with him; and Abimelech 40 took 3947-4 an axe 7134 in his hand, 3027 and cut down 3772-4 a bough 7754 from the trees, 6086 and took 5375-4 it, and laid 7760-4 [it] on his shoulder, 7926 and said 559-4 unto the people 5971 that [were] with him, What ye have seen 7200-1 me do, 6213-1 make haste, 4116-16 [and] do 6213-3 as I 3644 [have done].

9:49 And all the people 5971 likewise cut down 3772-4 every man 376 his bough, 7754 and followed 3212-4 310 Abimelech, 40 and put 7760-4 [them] to the hold, 6877 and set 3341-55 the hold 6877 on fire 784 upon them; so that all the men 582 of the tower 4026 of Shechem 7927 died 4191-4 also, about a thousand 505 men 376 and women. 802

9:50 Then went 3212-4 Abimelech 40 to Thebez, 8405 and encamped 2583-4 against Thebez, 8405 and took 3920-4 it.

9:51 But there was a strong 5797 tower 4026 within 8432 the city, 5892 and thither fled 5127-4 all the men 582 and women, 802 and all they 1167 of the city, 5892 and shut 5462-4 [it] to them, and gat them up 5927-4 to the top 1406 of the tower. 4026

9:52 And Abimelech 40 came 935-4 unto the tower, 4026 and fought 3898-11 against it, and went hard 5066-4 unto the door 6607 of the tower 4026 to burn 8313-2 it with fire. 784

9:53 And a certain 259 woman 802 cast 7993-55 a piece 6400 of a millstone 7393 upon Abimelech's 40 head, 7218 and all to brake 7533-55 his skull. 1538

9:54 Then he called 7121-4 hastily 4120 unto the young man 5288 his armourbearer, 5375-6 3627 and said 559-4 unto him, Draw 8025-3 thy sword, 2719 and slay 4191-33 me, that men say 559-4 not of me, A woman 802 slew 2026-1 him. And his young man 5288 thrust him through, 1856-4 and he died. 4191-4

9:55 And when the men 376 of Israel 3478 saw 7200-4 that Abimelech 40 was dead, 4191-1 they departed 3212-4 every man 376 unto his place. 4725

9:56 Thus God 430 rendered 7725-55 the wickedness 7451 of Abimelech, 40 which he did 6213-1 unto his father, 1 in slaying 2026-2 his seventy 7657 brethren: 251

9:57 And all the evil 7451 of the men 582 of Shechem 7927 did God 430 render 7725-52 upon their heads: 7218 and upon them came 935-4 the curse 7045 of Jotham 3147 the son 1121 of Jerubbaal. 3378

10:1 And after 310 Abimelech 40 there arose 6965-4 to defend 3467-53 Israel 3478 Tola 8439 the son 1121 of Puah, 6312 the son 1121 of Dodo, 1734 a man 376 of Issachar; 3485 and he dwelt 3427-6 in Shamir 8069 in mount 2022 Ephraim. 669

10:2 And he judged 8199-4 Israel 3478 twenty 6242 and three 7969 years, 8141 and died, 4191-4 and was buried 6912-11 in Shamir. 8069

10:3 And after 310 him arose 6965-4 Jair, 2971 a Gileadite, 1569 and judged 8199-4 Israel 3478 twenty 6242 and two 8147 years. 8141

10:4 And he had thirty 7970 sons 1121 that rode 7392-6 on thirty 7970 ass colts, 5895 and they had thirty 7970 cities, 5892 which are called 7121-4 Havothjair 2334|2971 unto this day, 3117 which [are] in the land 776 of Gilead. 1568

10:5 And Jair 2971 died, 4191-4 and was buried 6912-11 in Camon. 7056

10:6 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did 6213-2 evil 7451 again 3254-55 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 and served 5647-4 Baalim, 1168 and Ashtaroth, 6252 and the gods 430 of Syria, 758 and the gods 430 of Zidon, 6721 and the gods 430 of Moab, 4124 and the gods 430 of the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 and the gods 430 of the Philistines, 6430 and forsook 5800-4 the LORD, 3068 and served 5647-1 not him.

10:7 And the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 was hot 2734-4 against Israel, 3478 and he sold 4376-4 them into the hands 3027 of the Philistines, 6430 and into the hands 3027 of the children 1121 of Ammon. 5983

10:8 And that year 8141 they vexed 7492-4 and oppressed 7533-25 the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 eighteen 8083 6240 years, 8141 all the children 1121 of Israel 3478 that [were] on the other side 5676 Jordan 3383 in the land 776 of the Amorites, 567 which [is] in Gilead. 1568

10:9 Moreover the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 passed over 5674-4 Jordan 3383 to fight 3898-9 also against Judah, 3063 and against Benjamin, 1144 and against the house 1004 of Ephraim; 669 so that Israel 3478 was sore 3966 distressed. 3334-4

10:10 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 cried 2199-4 unto the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 We have sinned 2398-1 against thee, both because we have forsaken 5800-1 our God, 430 and also served 5647-4 Baalim. 1168

10:11 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 [Did] not [I deliver you] from the Egyptians, 4714 and from the Amorites, 567 from the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 and from the Philistines? 6430

10:12 The Zidonians 6722 also, and the Amalekites, 6002 and the Maonites, 4584 did oppress 3905-1 you; and ye cried 6817-4 to me, and I delivered 3467-55 you out of their hand. 3027

10:13 Yet ye have forsaken 5800-1 me, and served 5647-4 other 312 gods: 430 wherefore I will deliver 3467-53 you no more. 3254-55

10:14 Go 3212-3 and cry 2199-3 unto the gods 430 which ye have chosen; 977-1 let them 1992 deliver 3467-55 you in the time 6256 of your tribulation. 6869

10:15 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto the LORD, 3068 We have sinned: 2398-1 do 6213-3 thou unto us whatsoever seemeth 5869 good 2896 unto thee; deliver 5337-54 us only, we pray thee, this day. 3117

10:16 And they put away 5493-55 the strange 5236 gods 430 from among 7130 them, and served 5647-4 the LORD: 3068 and his soul 5315 was grieved 7114-4 for the misery 5999 of Israel. 3478

10:17 Then the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 were gathered together, 6817-11 and encamped 2583-4 in Gilead. 1568 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 assembled 622-11 themselves together, and encamped 2583-4 in Mizpeh. 4709

10:18 And the people 5971 [and] princes 8269 of Gilead 1568 said 559-4 one 376 to another, 7453 What man 376 [is he] that will begin 2490-55 to fight 3898-9 against the children 1121 of Ammon? 5983 he shall be head 7218 over all the inhabitants 3427-6 of Gilead. 1568

11:1 Now Jephthah 3316 the Gileadite 1569 was a mighty 1368 man of valour, 2428 and he [was] the son 1121 of an harlot: 802 2181-6 and Gilead 1568 begat 3205-55 Jephthah. 3316

11:2 And Gilead's 1568 wife 802 bare 3205-4 him sons; 1121 and his wife's 802 sons 1121 grew up, 1431-4 and they thrust out 1644-17 Jephthah, 3316 and said 559-4 unto him, Thou shalt not inherit 5157-4 in our father's 1 house; 1004 for thou [art] the son 1121 of a strange 312 woman. 802

11:3 Then Jephthah 3316 fled 1272-4 from 6440 his brethren, 251 and dwelt 3427-4 in the land 776 of Tob: 2897 and there were gathered 3950-101 vain 7386 men 582 to Jephthah, 3316 and went out 3318-4 with him.

11:4 And it came to pass in process of time, 3117 that the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 made war 3898-11 against Israel. 3478

11:5 And it was so, that when the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 made war 3898-8 against Israel, 3478 the elders 2205 of Gilead 1568 went 3212-4 to fetch 3947-2 Jephthah 3316 out of the land 776 of Tob: 2897

11:6 And they said 559-4 unto Jephthah, 3316 Come, 3212-3 and be our captain, 7101 that we may fight 3898-11 with the children 1121 of Ammon. 5983

11:7 And Jephthah 3316 said 559-4 unto the elders 2205 of Gilead, 1568 Did not ye hate 8130-1 me, and expel 1644-17 me out of my father's 1 house? 1004 and why are ye come 935-1 unto me now when ye are in distress? 6887-1

11:8 And the elders 2205 of Gilead 1568 said 559-4 unto Jephthah, 3316 Therefore we turn 7725-1 again to thee now, that thou mayest go 1980-1 with us, and fight 3898-8 against the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 and be our head 7218 over all the inhabitants 3427-6 of Gilead. 1568

11:9 And Jephthah 3316 said 559-4 unto the elders 2205 of Gilead, 1568 If ye bring me home again 7725-56 to fight 3898-9 against the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 and the LORD 3068 deliver 5414-1 them before 6440 me, shall I be your head? 7218

11:10 And the elders 2205 of Gilead 1568 said 559-4 unto Jephthah, 3316 The LORD 3068 be witness 8085-6 between us, if we do 6213-4 not so according to thy words. 1697

11:11 Then Jephthah 3316 went 3212-4 with the elders 2205 of Gilead, 1568 and the people 5971 made 7760-4 him head 7218 and captain 7101 over them: and Jephthah 3316 uttered 1696-17 all his words 1697 before 6440 the LORD 3068 in Mizpeh. 4709

11:12 And Jephthah 3316 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 unto the king 4428 of the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 saying, 559-2 What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come 935-1 against me to fight 3898-9 in my land? 776

11:13 And the king 4428 of the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 answered 559-4 unto the messengers 4397 of Jephthah, 3316 Because Israel 3478 took 3947-1 away my land, 776 when they came up 5927-2 out of Egypt, 4714 from Arnon 769 even unto Jabbok, 2999 and unto Jordan: 3383 now therefore restore those [lands] again 7725-54 peaceably. 7965

11:14 And Jephthah 3316 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 again 3254-55 unto the king 4428 of the children 1121 of Ammon: 5983

11:15 And said 559-4 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 Jephthah, 3316 Israel 3478 took 3947-1 not away the land 776 of Moab, 4124 nor the land 776 of the children 1121 of Ammon: 5983

11:16 But when Israel 3478 came up 5927-2 from Egypt, 4714 and walked 3212-4 through the wilderness 4057 unto the Red 5488 sea, 3220 and came 935-4 to Kadesh; 6946

11:17 Then Israel 3478 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 unto the king 4428 of Edom, 123 saying, 559-2 Let me, I pray thee, pass 5674-4 through thy land: 776 but the king 4428 of Edom 123 would not hearken 8085-1 [thereto]. And in like manner they sent 7971-1 unto the king 4428 of Moab: 4124 but he would 14-1 not [consent]: and Israel 3478 abode 3427-4 in Kadesh. 6946

11:18 Then they went 3212-4 along through the wilderness, 4057 and compassed 5437-4 the land 776 of Edom, 123 and the land 776 of Moab, 4124 and came 935-4 by the east side 4217 8121 of the land 776 of Moab, 4124 and pitched 2583-4 on the other side 5676 of Arnon, 769 but came 935-1 not within the border 1366 of Moab: 4124 for Arnon 769 [was] the border 1366 of Moab. 4124

11:19 And Israel 3478 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 unto Sihon 5511 king 4428 of the Amorites, 567 the king 4428 of Heshbon; 2809 and Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto him, Let us pass, 5674-4 we pray thee, through thy land 776 into 5704 my place. 4725

11:20 But Sihon 5511 trusted 539-52 not Israel 3478 to pass 5674-2 through his coast: 1366 but Sihon 5511 gathered 622-4 all his people 5971 together, and pitched 2583-4 in Jahaz, 3096 and fought 3898-11 against Israel. 3478

11:21 And the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 delivered 5414-4 Sihon 5511 and all his people 5971 into the hand 3027 of Israel, 3478 and they smote 5221-55 them: so Israel 3478 possessed 3423-4 all the land 776 of the Amorites, 567 the inhabitants 3427-6 of that country. 776

11:22 And they possessed 3423-4 all the coasts 1366 of the Amorites, 567 from Arnon 769 even unto Jabbok, 2999 and from the wilderness 4057 even unto Jordan. 3383

11:23 So now the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 hath dispossessed 3423-52 the Amorites 567 from before 6440 his people 5971 Israel, 3478 and shouldest thou possess 3423-4 it?

11:24 Wilt not thou possess 3423-4 that which Chemosh 3645 thy god 430 giveth thee to possess? 3423-55 So whomsoever the LORD 3068 our God 430 shall drive out 3423-52 from before 6440 us, them will we possess. 3423-4

11:25 And now [art] thou any thing better 2896 than Balak 1111 the son 1121 of Zippor, 6834 king 4428 of Moab? 4124 did he ever 7378-2 strive 7378-1 against Israel, 3478 or did he ever 3898-9 fight 3898-8 against them,

11:26 While Israel 3478 dwelt 3427-2 in Heshbon 2809 and her towns, 1323 and in Aroer 6177 and her towns, 1323 and in all the cities 5892 that [be] along by the coasts 3027 of Arnon, 769 three 7969 hundred 3967 years? 8141 why therefore did ye not recover 5337-52 [them] within that time? 6256

11:27 Wherefore I have not sinned 2398-1 against thee, but thou doest 6213-6 me 853 wrong 7451 to war 3898-9 against me: the LORD 3068 the Judge 8199-6 be judge 8199-4 this day 3117 between the children 1121 of Israel 3478 and the children 1121 of Ammon. 5983

11:28 Howbeit the king 4428 of the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 hearkened 8085-1 not unto the words 1697 of Jephthah 3316 which he sent 7971-1 him.

11:29 Then the Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 came upon Jephthah, 3316 and he passed over 5674-4 Gilead, 1568 and Manasseh, 4519 and passed over 5674-4 Mizpeh 4708 of Gilead, 1568 and from Mizpeh 4708 of Gilead 1568 he passed over 5674-1 [unto] the children 1121 of Ammon. 5983

11:30 And Jephthah 3316 vowed 5087-4 a vow 5088 unto the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 If thou shalt without fail 5414-2 deliver 5414-4 the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 into mine hands, 3027

11:31 Then it shall be, that whatsoever 3318-6 cometh forth 3318-4 of the doors 1817 of my house 1004 to meet 7125-2 me, when I return 7725-2 in peace 7965 from the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 shall surely be the LORD'S, 3068 and I will offer it up 5927-52 for a burnt offering. 5930

11:32 So Jephthah 3316 passed over 5674-4 unto the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 to fight 3898-9 against them; and the LORD 3068 delivered 5414-4 them into his hands. 3027

11:33 And he smote 5221-55 them from Aroer, 6177 even till thou come 935-2 to Minnith, 4511 [even] twenty 6242 cities, 5892 and unto the plain 58 of the vineyards, 3754|64 with a very 3966 great 1419 slaughter. 4347 Thus the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 were subdued 3665-11 before 6440 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

11:34 And Jephthah 3316 came 935-4 to Mizpeh 4709 unto his house, 1004 and, behold, his daughter 1323 came out 3318-6 to meet 7125-2 him with timbrels 8596 and with dances: 4246 and she [was his] only child; 3173 beside her he had neither son 1121 nor 176 daughter. 1323

11:35 And it came to pass, when he saw 7200-2 her, that he rent 7167-4 his clothes, 899 and said, 559-4 Alas, 162 my daughter! 1323 thou hast brought me very 3766-53 low, 3766-52 and thou art one of them that trouble 5916-6 me: for I have opened 6475-1 my mouth 6310 unto the LORD, 3068 and I cannot 3808 3201-4 go back. 7725-2

11:36 And she said 559-4 unto him, My father, 1 [if] thou hast opened 6475-1 thy mouth 6310 unto the LORD, 3068 do 6213-3 to me according to that which hath proceeded 3318-1 out of thy mouth; 6310 forasmuch 310 as 834 the LORD 3068 hath taken 6213-1 vengeance 5360 for thee of thine enemies, 341-6 [even] of the children 1121 of Ammon. 5983

11:37 And she said 559-4 unto her father, 1 Let this thing 1697 be done 6213-11 for me: let me alone 7503-54 two 8147 months, 2320 that I may go 3212-4 up and down 3381-1 upon the mountains, 2022 and bewail 1058-4 my virginity, 1331 I and my fellows. 7464|7474-k

11:38 And he said, 559-4 Go. 3212-3 And he sent her away 7971-4 [for] two 8147 months: 2320 and she went 3212-4 with her companions, 7464 and bewailed 1058-4 her virginity 1331 upon the mountains. 2022

11:39 And it came to pass at the end 7093 of two 8147 months, 2320 that she returned 7725-4 unto her father, 1 who did 6213-4 with her [according] to his vow 5088 which he had vowed: 5087-1 and she knew 3045-1 no man. 376 And it was a custom 2706 in Israel, 3478

11:40 [That] the daughters 1323 of Israel 3478 went 3212-4 yearly 3117 3117 to lament 8567-15 the daughter 1323 of Jephthah 3316 the Gileadite 1569 four 702 days 3117 in a year. 8141

12:1 And the men 376 of Ephraim 669 gathered themselves together, 6817-11 and went 5674-4 northward, 6828 and said 559-4 unto Jephthah, 3316 Wherefore passedst thou over 5674-1 to fight 3898-9 against the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 and didst not call 7121-1 us to go 3212-2 with thee? we will burn 8313-4 thine house 1004 upon thee with fire. 784

12:2 And Jephthah 3316 said 559-4 unto them, I and my people 5971 were 1961-1 at great 3966 strife 376 7379 with the children 1121 of Ammon; 5983 and when I called 2199-4 you, ye delivered 3467-52 me not out of their hands. 3027

12:3 And when I saw 7200-4 that ye delivered 3467-56 [me] not, I put 7760-4 my life 5315 in my hands, 3709 and passed over 5674-4 against the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 and the LORD 3068 delivered 5414-4 them into my hand: 3027 wherefore then are ye come up 5927-1 unto me this day, 3117 to fight 3898-9 against me?

12:4 Then Jephthah 3316 gathered together 6908-4 all the men 582 of Gilead, 1568 and fought 3898-11 with Ephraim: 669 and the men 582 of Gilead 1568 smote 5221-55 Ephraim, 669 because they said, 559-1 Ye Gileadites 1568 [are] fugitives 6412 of Ephraim 669 among 8432 the Ephraimites, 669 [and] among 8432 the Manassites. 4519

12:5 And the Gileadites 1568 took 3920-4 the passages 4569 of Jordan 3383 before the Ephraimites: 669 and it was [so], that when those Ephraimites 669 which were escaped 6412 said, 559-4 Let me go over; 5674-4 that the men 582 of Gilead 1568 said 559-4 unto him, [Art] thou an Ephraimite? 673 If he said, 559-4 Nay;

12:6 Then said 559-4 they unto him, Say 559-3 now Shibboleth: 7641 and he said 559-4 Sibboleth: 5451 for he could not frame 3559-55 to pronounce 1696-15 [it] right. Then they took 270-4 him, and slew 7819-4 him at the passages 4569 of Jordan: 3383 and there fell 5307-4 at that time 6256 of the Ephraimites 669 forty 705 and two 8147 thousand. 505

12:7 And Jephthah 3316 judged 8199-4 Israel 3478 six 8337 years. 8141 Then died 4191-4 Jephthah 3316 the Gileadite, 1569 and was buried 6912-11 in [one of] the cities 5892 of Gilead. 1568

12:8 And after 310 him Ibzan 78 of Bethlehem 1035 judged 8199-4 Israel. 3478

12:9 And he had thirty 7970 sons, 1121 and thirty 7970 daughters, 1323 [whom] he sent 7971-14 abroad, 2351 and took in 935-52 thirty 7970 daughters 1323 from abroad 2351 for his sons. 1121 And he judged 8199-4 Israel 3478 seven 7651 years. 8141

12:10 Then died 4191-4 Ibzan, 78 and was buried 6912-11 at Bethlehem. 1035

12:11 And after 310 him Elon, 356 a Zebulonite, 2075 judged 8199-4 Israel; 3478 and he judged 8199-4 Israel 3478 ten 6235 years. 8141

12:12 And Elon 356 the Zebulonite 2075 died, 4191-4 and was buried 6912-11 in Aijalon 357 in the country 776 of Zebulun. 2074

12:13 And after 310 him Abdon 5658 the son 1121 of Hillel, 1985 a Pirathonite, 6553 judged 8199-4 Israel. 3478

12:14 And he had forty 705 sons 1121 and thirty 7970 nephews, 1121 1121 that rode 7392-6 on threescore and ten 7657 ass colts: 5895 and he judged 8199-4 Israel 3478 eight 8083 years. 8141

12:15 And Abdon 5658 the son 1121 of Hillel 1985 the Pirathonite 6553 died, 4191-4 and was buried 6912-11 in Pirathon 6552 in the land 776 of Ephraim, 669 in the mount 2022 of the Amalekites. 6003

13:1 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did 6213-2 evil 7451 again 3254-55 in the sight 5869 of the LORD; 3068 and the LORD 3068 delivered 5414-4 them into the hand 3027 of the Philistines 6430 forty 705 years. 8141

13:2 And there was a certain 259 man 376 of Zorah, 6881 of the family 4940 of the Danites, 1839 whose name 8034 [was] Manoah; 4495 and his wife 802 [was] barren, 6135 and bare 3205-1 not.

13:3 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 appeared 7200-11 unto the woman, 802 and said 559-4 unto her, Behold now, thou [art] barren, 6135 and bearest 3205-1 not: but thou shalt conceive, 2029-1 and bear 3205-1 a son. 1121

13:4 Now therefore beware, 8104-10 I pray thee, and drink 8354-4 not wine 3196 nor strong drink, 7941 and eat 398-4 not any unclean 2931 [thing]:

13:5 For, lo, thou shalt conceive, 2030 and bear 3205-6 a son; 1121 and no razor 4177 shall come 5927-4 on his head: 7218 for the child 5288 shall be a Nazarite 5139 unto God 430 from the womb: 990 and he shall begin 2490-55 to deliver 3467-53 Israel 3478 out of the hand 3027 of the Philistines. 6430

13:6 Then the woman 802 came 935-4 and told 559-4 her husband, 376 saying, 559-2 A man 376 of God 430 came 935-1 unto me, and his countenance 4758 [was] like the countenance 4758 of an angel 4397 of God, 430 very 3966 terrible: 3372-12 but I asked 7592-1 him not whence he [was], neither told 5046-52 he me his name: 8034

13:7 But he said 559-4 unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, 2030 and bear 3205-6 a son; 1121 and now drink 8354-4 no wine 3196 nor strong drink, 7941 neither eat 398-4 any unclean 2932 [thing]: for the child 5288 shall be a Nazarite 5139 to God 430 from the womb 990 to the day 3117 of his death. 4194

13:8 Then Manoah 4495 intreated 6279-4 the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 O 994 my Lord, 136 let 4994 the man 376 of God 430 which thou didst send 7971-1 come 935-4 again unto us, and teach 3384-55 us what we shall do 6213-4 unto the child 5288 that shall be born. 3205-27

13:9 And God 430 hearkened 8085-4 to the voice 6963 of Manoah; 4495 and the angel 4397 of God 430 came 935-4 again unto the woman 802 as she sat 3427-6 in the field: 7704 but Manoah 4495 her husband 376 [was] not with her.

13:10 And the woman 802 made haste, 4116-17 and ran, 7323-4 and shewed 5046-55 her husband, 376 and said 559-4 unto him, Behold, the man 376 hath appeared 7200-8 unto me, that came 935-1 unto me the [other] day. 3117

13:11 And Manoah 4495 arose, 6965-4 and went 3212-4 after 310 his wife, 802 and came 935-4 to the man, 376 and said 559-4 unto him, [Art] thou the man 376 that spakest 1696-14 unto the woman? 802 And he said, 559-4 I [am].

13:12 And Manoah 4495 said, 559-4 Now let thy words 1697 come to pass. 935-4 How shall we order 4941 the child, 5288 and [how] shall we do 4639 unto him?

13:13 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Manoah, 4495 Of all that I said 559-1 unto the woman 802 let her beware. 8104-11

13:14 She may not eat 398-4 of any [thing] that cometh 3318-4 of the vine, 1612 3196 neither let her drink 8354-4 wine 3196 or strong drink, 7941 nor eat 398-4 any unclean 2932 [thing]: all that I commanded 6680-14 her let her observe. 8104-4

13:15 And Manoah 4495 said 559-4 unto the angel 4397 of the LORD, 3068 I pray thee, let us detain 6113-4 thee, until we shall have made ready 6213-4 a kid 1423 5795 for 6440 thee.

13:16 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Manoah, 4495 Though 518 thou detain 6113-4 me, I will not eat 398-4 of thy bread: 3899 and if thou wilt offer 6213-4 a burnt offering, 5930 thou must offer 5927-55 it unto the LORD. 3068 For Manoah 4495 knew 3045-1 not that he [was] an angel 4397 of the LORD. 3068

13:17 And Manoah 4495 said 559-4 unto the angel 4397 of the LORD, 3068 What [is] thy name, 8034 that when thy sayings 1697 come to pass 935-4 we may do thee honour? 3513-14

13:18 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, Why askest 7592-4 thou thus after my name, 8034 seeing it [is] secret? 6383|6383-k

13:19 So Manoah 4495 took 3947-4 a kid 1423 5795 with a meat offering, 4503 and offered 5927-4 [it] upon a rock 6697 unto the LORD: 3068 and [the angel] did 6213-2 wondrously; 6381-56 and Manoah 4495 and his wife 802 looked on. 7200-6

13:20 For it came to pass, when the flame 3851 went up 5927-2 toward heaven 8064 from off the altar, 4196 that the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 ascended 5927-4 in the flame 3851 of the altar. 4196 And Manoah 4495 and his wife 802 looked on 7200-6 [it], and fell on 5307-4 their faces 6440 to the ground. 776

13:21 But the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 did no more 3254-1 appear 7200-9 to Manoah 4495 and to his wife. 802 Then Manoah 4495 knew 3045-1 that he [was] an angel 4397 of the LORD. 3068

13:22 And Manoah 4495 said 559-4 unto his wife, 802 We shall surely 4191-2 die, 4191-4 because we have seen 7200-1 God. 430

13:23 But his wife 802 said 559-4 unto him, If 3863 the LORD 3068 were pleased 2654-1 to kill 4191-53 us, he would not have received 3947-1 a burnt offering 5930 and a meat offering 4503 at our hands, 3027 neither would he have shewed 7200-52 us all these [things], nor would as at this time 6256 have told 8085-52 us [such things] as these. 2063

13:24 And the woman 802 bare 3205-4 a son, 1121 and called 7121-4 his name 8034 Samson: 8123 and the child 5288 grew, 1431-4 and the LORD 3068 blessed 1288-17 him.

13:25 And the Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 began 2490-55 to move 6470-2 him at times in the camp of Dan 4264|1835|4265 between Zorah 6881 and Eshtaol. 847

14:1 And Samson 8123 went down 3381-4 to Timnath, 8553 and saw 7200-4 a woman 802 in Timnath 8553 of the daughters 1323 of the Philistines. 6430

14:2 And he came up, 5927-4 and told 5046-55 his father 1 and his mother, 517 and said, 559-4 I have seen 7200-1 a woman 802 in Timnath 8553 of the daughters 1323 of the Philistines: 6430 now therefore get 3947-3 her for me to wife. 802

14:3 Then his father 1 and his mother 517 said 559-4 unto him, [Is there] never 369 a woman 802 among the daughters 1323 of thy brethren, 251 or among all my people, 5971 that thou goest 1980-6 to take 3947-2 a wife 802 of the uncircumcised 6189 Philistines? 6430 And Samson 8123 said 559-4 unto his father, 1 Get 3947-3 her for me; for she pleaseth 3474-1 5869 me well.

14:4 But his father 1 and his mother 517 knew 3045-1 not that it [was] of the LORD, 3068 that he sought 1245-18 an occasion 8385 against the Philistines: 6430 for at that time 6256 the Philistines 6430 had dominion 4910-6 over Israel. 3478

14:5 Then went Samson 8123 down, 3381-4 and his father 1 and his mother, 517 to Timnath, 8553 and came 935-4 to the vineyards 3754 of Timnath: 8553 and, behold, a young 3715 lion 738 roared 7580-6 against 7125-2 him.

14:6 And the Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 came mightily 6743-4 upon him, and he rent 8156-17 him as he would have rent 8156-15 a kid, 1423 and [he had] nothing 369 3972 in his hand: 3027 but he told 5046-52 not his father 1 or his mother 517 what he had done. 6213-1

14:7 And he went down, 3381-4 and talked 1696-17 with the woman; 802 and she pleased 3474-4 5869 Samson 8123 well.

14:8 And after a time 3117 he returned 7725-4 to take 3947-2 her, and he turned aside 5493-4 to see 7200-2 the carcase 4658 of the lion: 738 and, behold, [there was] a swarm 5712 of bees 1682 and honey 1706 in the carcase 1472 of the lion. 738

14:9 And he took 7287-4 thereof in his hands, 3709 and went 3212-4 on 1980-2 eating, 398-2 and came 3212-4 to his father 1 and mother, 517 and he gave 5414-4 them, and they did eat: 398-4 but he told 5046-52 not them that he had taken 7287-1 the honey 1706 out of the carcase 1472 of the lion. 738

14:10 So his father 1 went down 3381-4 unto the woman: 802 and Samson 8123 made 6213-4 there a feast; 4960 for so used the young men 970 to do. 6213-4

14:11 And it came to pass, when they saw 7200-2 him, that they brought 3947-4 thirty 7970 companions 4828 to be with him.

14:12 And Samson 8123 said 559-4 unto them, I will now put forth 2330-4 a riddle 2420 unto you: if ye can certainly 5046-53 declare 5046-55 it me within the seven 7651 days 3117 of the feast, 4960 and find [it] out, 4672-1 then I will give 5414-1 you thirty 7970 sheets 5466 and thirty 7970 change 2487 of garments: 899

14:13 But if ye cannot 3808 3201-4 declare 5046-53 [it] me, then shall ye give 5414-1 me thirty 7970 sheets 5466 and thirty 7970 change 2487 of garments. 899 And they said 559-4 unto him, Put forth 2330-3 thy riddle, 2420 that we may hear 8085-4 it.

14:14 And he said 559-4 unto them, Out of the eater 398-6 came forth 3318-1 meat, 3978 and out of the strong 5794 came forth 3318-1 sweetness. 4966 And they could 3201-1 not in three 7969 days 3117 expound 5046-53 the riddle. 2420

14:15 And it came to pass on the seventh 7637 day, 3117 that they said 559-4 unto Samson's 8123 wife, 802 Entice 6601-16 thy husband, 376 that he may declare 5046-55 unto us the riddle, 2420 lest we burn 8313-4 thee and thy father's 1 house 1004 with fire: 784 have ye called 7121-1 us to take that we have? 3423-2 [is it] not [so]?

14:16 And Samson's 8123 wife 802 wept 1058-4 before him, and said, 559-4 Thou dost but hate 8130-1 me, and lovest 157-1 me not: thou hast put forth 2330-1 a riddle 2420 unto the children 1121 of my people, 5971 and hast not told 5046-52 [it] me. And he said 559-4 unto her, Behold, I have not told 5046-52 [it] my father 1 nor my mother, 517 and shall I tell 5046-55 [it] thee?

14:17 And she wept 1058-4 before him the seven 7651 days, 3117 while their feast 4960 lasted: 1961-1 and it came to pass on the seventh 7637 day, 3117 that he told 5046-55 her, because she lay sore 6693-52 upon him: and she told 5046-55 the riddle 2420 to the children 1121 of her people. 5971

14:18 And the men 582 of the city 5892 said 559-4 unto him on the seventh 7637 day 3117 before the sun 2775 went down, 935-4 What [is] sweeter 4966 than honey? 1706 and what [is] stronger 5794 than a lion? 738 And he said 559-4 unto them, If 3884 ye had not plowed 2790-1 with my heifer, 5697 ye had not found out 4672-1 my riddle. 2420

14:19 And the Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 came 6743-4 upon him, and he went down 3381-4 to Ashkelon, 831 and slew 5221-55 thirty 7970 men 376 of them, and took 3947-4 their spoil, 2488 and gave 5414-4 change 2487 of garments unto them which expounded 5046-56 the riddle. 2420 And his anger 639 was kindled, 2734-4 and he went up 5927-4 to his father's 1 house. 1004

14:20 But Samson's 8123 wife 802 was [given] to his companion, 4828 whom he had used as his friend. 7462-14

15:1 But it came to pass within a while after, 3117 in the time 3117 of wheat 2406 harvest, 7105 that Samson 8123 visited 6485-4 his wife 802 with a kid; 1423 5795 and he said, 559-4 I will go in 935-4 to my wife 802 into the chamber. 2315 But her father 1 would not suffer 5414-1 him to go in. 935-2

15:2 And her father 1 said, 559-4 I verily 559-2 thought 559-1 that thou hadst utterly 8130-2 hated 8130-1 her; therefore I gave 5414-4 her to thy companion: 4828 [is] not her younger 6996 sister 269 fairer 2896 than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.

15:3 And Samson 8123 said 559-4 concerning them, Now 6471 shall I be more blameless 5352-8 than the Philistines, 6430 though I do 6213-6 them a displeasure. 7451

15:4 And Samson 8123 went 3212-4 and caught 3920-4 three 7969 hundred 3967 foxes, 7776 and took 3947-4 firebrands, 3940 and turned 6437-55 tail 2180 to tail, 2180 and put 7760-4 a 259 firebrand 3940 in the midst 8432 between two 8147 tails. 2180

15:5 And when he had set 1197-55 the brands 3940 on fire, 784 he let [them] go 7971-17 into the standing corn 7054 of the Philistines, 6430 and burnt up 1197-55 both the shocks, 1430 and also the standing corn, 7054 with the vineyards 3754 [and] olives. 2132

15:6 Then the Philistines 6430 said, 559-4 Who hath done 6213-1 this? And they answered, 559-4 Samson, 8123 the son in law 2860 of the Timnite, 8554 because he had taken 3947-1 his wife, 802 and given 5414-4 her to his companion. 4828 And the Philistines 6430 came up, 5927-4 and burnt 8313-4 her and her father 1 with fire. 784

15:7 And Samson 8123 said 559-4 unto them, Though ye have done 6213-4 this, 2063 yet 518 will I be avenged 5358-8 of you, and after 310 that I will cease. 2308-4

15:8 And he smote 5221-55 them hip 7785 and 5921 thigh 3409 with a great 1419 slaughter: 4347 and he went down 3381-4 and dwelt 3427-4 in the top 5585 of the rock 5553 Etam. 5862

15:9 Then the Philistines 6430 went up, 5927-4 and pitched 2583-4 in Judah, 3063 and spread 5203-11 themselves in Lehi. 3896

15:10 And the men 376 of Judah 3063 said, 559-4 Why are ye come up 5927-1 against us? And they answered, 559-4 To bind 631-2 Samson 8123 are we come up, 5927-1 to do 6213-2 to him as he hath done 6213-1 to us.

15:11 Then three 7969 thousand 505 men 376 of Judah 3063 went 3381-4 to the top 5585 of the rock 5553 Etam, 5862 and said 559-4 to Samson, 8123 Knowest 3045-1 thou not that the Philistines 6430 [are] rulers 4910-6 over us? what [is] this [that] thou hast done 6213-1 unto us? And he said 559-4 unto them, As they did 6213-1 unto me, so have I done 6213-1 unto them.

15:12 And they said 559-4 unto him, We are come down 3381-1 to bind 631-2 thee, that we may deliver 5414-2 thee into the hand 3027 of the Philistines. 6430 And Samson 8123 said 559-4 unto them, Swear 7650-10 unto me, that ye will not fall upon 6293-4 me yourselves.

15:13 And they spake 559-4 unto him, saying, 559-2 No; but we will bind 631-4 thee fast, 631-2 and deliver 5414-1 thee into their hand: 3027 but surely 4191-53 we will not kill 4191-55 thee. And they bound 631-4 him with two 8147 new 2319 cords, 5688 and brought him up 5927-55 from the rock. 5553

15:14 [And] when he came 935-1 unto Lehi, 3896 the Philistines 6430 shouted 7321-52 against 7125-2 him: and the Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 came mightily 6743-4 upon him, and the cords 5688 that [were] upon his arms 2220 became as flax 6593 that was burnt 1197-1 with fire, 784 and his bands 612 loosed 4549-11 from off his hands. 3027

15:15 And he found 4672-4 a new 2961 jawbone 3895 of an ass, 2543 and put forth 7971-4 his hand, 3027 and took 3947-4 it, and slew 5221-55 a thousand 505 men 376 therewith.

15:16 And Samson 8123 said, 559-4 With the jawbone 3895 of an ass, 2543 heaps 2565 upon heaps, 2565 with the jaw 3895 of an ass 2543 have I slain 5221-52 a thousand 505 men. 376

15:17 And it came to pass, when he had made an end 3615-15 of speaking, 1696-15 that he cast away 7993-55 the jawbone 3895 out of his hand, 3027 and called 7121-4 that place 4725 Ramathlehi. 7437

15:18 And he was sore 3966 athirst, 6770-4 and called 7121-4 on the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 Thou hast given 5414-1 this great 1419 deliverance 8668 into the hand 3027 of thy servant: 5650 and now shall I die 4191-4 for thirst, 6772 and fall 5307-1 into the hand 3027 of the uncircumcised? 6189

15:19 But God 430 clave 1234-4 an hollow place 4388 that [was] in the jaw, 3895 and there came water 4325 thereout; 3318-4 and when he had drunk, 8354-4 his spirit 7307 came again, 7725-4 and he revived: 2421-4 wherefore he called 7121-1 the name 8034 thereof Enhakkore, 5875 which [is] in Lehi 3896 unto this day. 3117

15:20 And he judged 8199-4 Israel 3478 in the days 3117 of the Philistines 6430 twenty 6242 years. 8141

16:1 Then went 3212-4 Samson 8123 to Gaza, 5804 and saw 7200-4 there an harlot, 802 2181-6 and went in 935-4 unto her.

16:2 [And it was told] the Gazites, 5841 saying, 559-2 Samson 8123 is come 935-1 hither. And they compassed [him] in, 5437-4 and laid wait 693-4 for him all night 3915 in the gate 8179 of the city, 5892 and were quiet 2790-101 all the night, 3915 saying, 559-2 In the morning, 1242 when it is day, 216 we shall kill 2026-1 him.

16:3 And Samson 8123 lay 7901-4 till midnight, 2677 3915 and arose 6965-4 at midnight, 2677 3915 and took 270-4 the doors 1817 of the gate 8179 of the city, 5892 and the two 8147 posts, 4201 and went away 5265-4 with them, bar 1280 and all, and put 7760-4 [them] upon his shoulders, 3802 and carried them up 5927-55 to the top 7218 of an hill 2022 that [is] before 6440 Hebron. 2275

16:4 And it came to pass afterward, 310 that he loved 157-4 a woman 802 in the valley 5158 of Sorek, 7796 whose name 8034 [was] Delilah. 1807

16:5 And the lords 5633 of the Philistines 6430 came up 5927-4 unto her, and said 559-4 unto her, Entice 6601-16 him, and see 7200-3 wherein his great 1419 strength 3581 [lieth], and by what [means] we may prevail 3201-4 against him, that we may bind 631-1 him to afflict 6031-15 him: and we will give 5414-4 thee every one 376 of us eleven hundred 505 3967 [pieces] of silver. 3701

16:6 And Delilah 1807 said 559-4 to Samson, 8123 Tell 5046-54 me, I pray thee, wherein thy great 1419 strength 3581 [lieth], and wherewith thou mightest be bound 631-11 to afflict 6031-15 thee.

16:7 And Samson 8123 said 559-4 unto her, If they bind 631-4 me with seven 7651 green 3892 withs 3499 that were never dried, 2717-27 then shall I be weak, 2470-1 and be as another 259 man. 120

16:8 Then the lords 5633 of the Philistines 6430 brought up 5927-55 to her seven 7651 green 3892 withs 3499 which had not been dried, 2717-27 and she bound 631-4 him with them.

16:9 Now [there were] men lying in wait, 693-6 abiding 3427-6 with her in the chamber. 2315 And she said 559-4 unto him, The Philistines 6430 [be] upon thee, Samson. 8123 And he brake 5423-17 the withs, 3499 as a thread 6616 of tow 5296 is broken 5423-11 when it toucheth 7306-53 the fire. 784 So his strength 3581 was not known. 3045-8

16:10 And Delilah 1807 said 559-4 unto Samson, 8123 Behold, thou hast mocked 2048-14 me, and told 1696-17 me lies: 3577 now tell 5046-54 me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound. 631-11

16:11 And he said 559-4 unto her, If they bind 631-4 me fast 631-2 with new 2319 ropes 5688 that never were occupied, 4399 6213-8 then shall I be weak, 2470-1 and be as another 259 man. 120

16:12 Delilah 1807 therefore took 3947-4 new 2319 ropes, 5688 and bound 631-4 him therewith, and said 559-4 unto him, The Philistines 6430 [be] upon thee, Samson. 8123 And [there were] liers in wait 693-6 abiding 3427-6 in the chamber. 2315 And he brake 5423-17 them from off his arms 2220 like a thread. 2339

16:13 And Delilah 1807 said 559-4 unto Samson, 8123 Hitherto 2008 thou hast mocked 2048-14 me, and told 1696-17 me lies: 3577 tell 5046-54 me wherewith thou mightest be bound. 631-11 And he said 559-4 unto her, If thou weavest 707-4 the seven 7651 locks 4253 of my head 7218 with the web. 4545

16:14 And she fastened 8628-4 [it] with the pin, 3489 and said 559-4 unto him, The Philistines 6430 [be] upon thee, Samson. 8123 And he awaked 3364-4 out of his sleep, 8142 and went away 5265-4 with the pin 3489 of the beam, 708 and with the web. 4545

16:15 And she said 559-4 unto him, How 349 canst thou say, 559-4 I love 157-1 thee, when thine heart 3820 [is] not with me? thou hast mocked 2048-14 me these three 7969 times, 6471 and hast not told 5046-52 me wherein thy great 1419 strength 3581 [lieth].

16:16 And it came to pass, when she pressed 6693-52 him daily 3117 with her words, 1697 and urged 509-17 him, [so] that his soul 5315 was vexed 7114-4 unto death; 4191-2

16:17 That he told 5046-55 her all his heart, 3820 and said 559-4 unto her, There hath not come 5927-1 a razor 4177 upon mine head; 7218 for I [have been] a Nazarite 5139 unto God 430 from my mother's 517 womb: 990 if I be shaven, 1548-27 then my strength 3581 will go 5493-1 from me, and I shall become weak, 2470-1 and be like any [other] man. 120

16:18 And when Delilah 1807 saw 7200-4 that he had told 5046-52 her all his heart, 3820 she sent 7971-4 and called 7121-4 for the lords 5633 of the Philistines, 6430 saying, 559-2 Come up 5927-3 this once, 6471 for he hath shewed 5046-52 me all his heart. 3820 Then the lords 5633 of the Philistines 6430 came up 5927-1 unto her, and brought 5927-55 money 3701 in their hand. 3027

16:19 And she made him sleep 3462-17 upon her knees; 1290 and she called 7121-4 for a man, 376 and she caused him to shave off 1548-17 the seven 7651 locks 4253 of his head; 7218 and she began 2490-55 to afflict 6031-15 him, and his strength 3581 went 5493-4 from him.

16:20 And she said, 559-4 The Philistines 6430 [be] upon thee, Samson. 8123 And he awoke 3364-4 out of his sleep, 8142 and said, 559-4 I will go out 3318-4 as at other times 6471 6471 before, and shake 5287-11 myself. And he wist 3045-1 not that the LORD 3068 was departed 5493-1 from him.

16:21 But the Philistines 6430 took 270-4 him, and put out 5365-17 his eyes, 5869 and brought him down 3381-55 to Gaza, 5804 and bound 631-4 him with fetters of brass; 5178 and he did grind 2912-6 in the prison 631-7 house. 1004

16:22 Howbeit the hair 8181 of his head 7218 began 2490-55 to grow 6779-15 again after 834 he was shaven. 1548-27

16:23 Then the lords 5633 of the Philistines 6430 gathered 622-8 them together for to offer 2076-2 a great 1419 sacrifice 2077 unto Dagon 1712 their god, 430 and to rejoice: 8057 for they said, 559-4 Our god 430 hath delivered 5414-1 Samson 8123 our enemy 341-6 into our hand. 3027

16:24 And when the people 5971 saw 7200-4 him, they praised 1984-17 their god: 430 for they said, 559-1 Our god 430 hath delivered 5414-1 into our hands 3027 our enemy, 341-6 and the destroyer 2717-56 of our country, 776 which slew 2491 many 7235-52 of us.

16:25 And it came to pass, when their hearts 3820 were merry, 2896 that they said, 559-4 Call 7121-3 for Samson, 8123 that he may make us sport. 7832-17 And they called 7121-4 for Samson 8123 out of the prison 631-7 house; 1004 and he made them 6440 sport: 6711-17 and they set 5975-55 him between the pillars. 5982

16:26 And Samson 8123 said 559-4 unto the lad 5288 that held 2388-56 him by the hand, 3027 Suffer 3240-54 me that I may feel 4184-54|3237-54-k the pillars 5982 whereupon the house 1004 standeth, 3559-12 that I may lean 8172-11 upon them.

16:27 Now the house 1004 was full 4390-1 of men 582 and women; 802 and all the lords 5633 of the Philistines 6430 [were] there; and [there were] upon the roof 1406 about three 7969 thousand 505 men 376 and women, 802 that beheld 7200-6 while Samson 8123 made sport. 7832-2

16:28 And Samson 8123 called 7121-4 unto the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 O Lord 136 GOD, 3069 remember 2142-3 me, I pray thee, and strengthen 2388-16 me, I pray thee, only this once, 6471 O God, 430 that I may be at once 259 avenged 5358-11 5359 of the Philistines 6430 for my two 8147 eyes. 5869

16:29 And Samson 8123 took hold 3943-4 of the two 8147 middle 8432 pillars 5982 upon which the house 1004 stood, 3559-12 and on which it was borne up, 5564-11 of the one 259 with his right hand, 3225 and of the other 259 with his left. 8040

16:30 And Samson 8123 said, 559-4 Let me 5315 die 4191-4 with the Philistines. 6430 And he bowed 5186-4 himself with [all his] might; 3581 and the house 1004 fell 5307-4 upon the lords, 5633 and upon all the people 5971 that [were] therein. So the dead 4191-5 which he slew 4191-52 at his death 4194 were more 7227 than [they] which he slew 4191-52 in his life. 2416

16:31 Then his brethren 251 and all the house 1004 of his father 1 came down, 3381-4 and took 5375-4 him, and brought [him] up, 5927-4 and buried 6912-4 him between Zorah 6881 and Eshtaol 847 in the buryingplace 6913 of Manoah 4495 his father. 1 And he judged 8199-1 Israel 3478 twenty 6242 years. 8141

17:1 And there was a man 376 of mount 2022 Ephraim, 669 whose name 8034 [was] Micah. 4321

17:2 And he said 559-4 unto his mother, 517 The eleven hundred 505 3967 [shekels] of silver 3701 that were taken 3947-27 from thee, about which thou cursedst, 422-1 and spakest 559-1 of also in mine ears, 241 behold, the silver 3701 [is] with me; I took 3947-1 it. And his mother 517 said, 559-4 Blessed 1288-7 [be thou] of the LORD, 3068 my son. 1121

17:3 And when he had restored 7725-55 the eleven hundred 505 3967 [shekels] of silver 3701 to his mother, 517 his mother 517 said, 559-4 I had wholly 6942-53 dedicated 6942-52 the silver 3701 unto the LORD 3068 from my hand 3027 for my son, 1121 to make 6213-2 a graven image 6459 and a molten image: 4541 now therefore I will restore 7725-55 it unto thee.

17:4 Yet he restored 7725-55 the money 3701 unto his mother; 517 and his mother 517 took 3947-4 two hundred 3967 [shekels] of silver, 3701 and gave 5414-4 them to the founder, 6884-6 who made 6213-4 thereof a graven image 6459 and a molten image: 4541 and they were in the house 1004 of Micah. 4321

17:5 And the man 376 Micah 4318 had an house 1004 of gods, 430 and made 6213-4 an ephod, 646 and teraphim, 8655 and consecrated 4390-17 3027 one 259 of his sons, 1121 who became his priest. 3548

17:6 In those days 3117 [there was] no king 4428 in Israel, 3478 [but] every man 376 did 6213-4 [that which was] right 3477 in his own eyes. 5869

17:7 And there was a young man 5288 out of Bethlehemjudah 1035 3063 of the family 4940 of Judah, 3063 who [was] a Levite, 3881 and he sojourned 1481-1 there.

17:8 And the man 376 departed 3212-4 out of the city 5892 from Bethlehemjudah 1035 3063 to sojourn 1481-2 where he could find 4672-4 [a place]: and he came 935-4 to mount 2022 Ephraim 669 to the house 1004 of Micah, 4318 as he journeyed. 6213-2 1870

17:9 And Micah 4318 said 559-4 unto him, Whence 370 comest 935-4 thou? And he said 559-4 unto him, I [am] a Levite 3881 of Bethlehemjudah, 1035 3063 and I go 1980-6 to sojourn 1481-2 where I may find 4672-4 [a place].

17:10 And Micah 4318 said 559-4 unto him, Dwell 3427-3 with me, and be unto me a father 1 and a priest, 3548 and I will give 5414-4 thee ten 6235 [shekels] of silver 3701 by the year, 3117 and a suit 6187 of apparel, 899 and thy victuals. 4241 So the Levite 3881 went in. 3212-4

17:11 And the Levite 3881 was content 2974-55 to dwell 3427-2 with the man; 376 and the young man 5288 was unto him as one 259 of his sons. 1121

17:12 And Micah 4318 consecrated 4390-17 3027 the Levite; 3881 and the young man 5288 became his priest, 3548 and was in the house 1004 of Micah. 4318

17:13 Then said 559-4 Micah, 4318 Now know 3045-1 I that the LORD 3068 will do me good, 3190-55 seeing I have a Levite 3881 to [my] priest. 3548

18:1 In those days 3117 [there was] no king 4428 in Israel: 3478 and in those days 3117 the tribe 7626 of the Danites 1839 sought 1245-18 them an inheritance 5159 to dwell in; 3427-2 for unto that day 3117 [all their] inheritance 5159 had not fallen 5307-1 unto them among 8432 the tribes 7626 of Israel. 3478

18:2 And the children 1121 of Dan 1835 sent 7971-4 of their family 4940 five 2568 men 582 from their coasts, 7098 men 582 1121 of valour, 2428 from Zorah, 6881 and from Eshtaol, 847 to spy out 7270-15 the land, 776 and to search 2713-2 it; and they said 559-4 unto them, Go, 3212-3 search 2713-3 the land: 776 who when they came 935-4 to mount 2022 Ephraim, 669 to the house 1004 of Micah, 4318 they lodged 3885-4 there.

18:3 When they [were] by the house 1004 of Micah, 4318 they knew 5234-52 the voice 6963 of the young man 5288 the Levite: 3881 and they turned in 5493-4 thither, and said 559-4 unto him, Who brought 935-52 thee hither? 1988 and what makest 6213-6 thou in this [place]? and what hast thou here?

18:4 And he said 559-4 unto them, Thus 2090 and thus 2090 dealeth 6213-1 Micah 4318 with me, and hath hired 7936-4 me, and I am his priest. 3548

18:5 And they said 559-4 unto him, Ask 7592-3 counsel, we pray thee, of God, 430 that we may know 3045-4 whether our way 1870 which we go 1980-6 shall be prosperous. 6743-55

18:6 And the priest 3548 said 559-4 unto them, Go 3212-3 in peace: 7965 before 5227 the LORD 3068 [is] your way 1870 wherein ye go. 3212-4

18:7 Then the five 2568 men 582 departed, 3212-4 and came 935-4 to Laish, 3919 and saw 7200-4 the people 5971 that [were] therein, 7130 how they dwelt 3427-6 careless, 983 after the manner 4941 of the Zidonians, 6722 quiet 8252-6 and secure; 982-6 and [there was] no magistrate 3423-6 6114 in the land, 776 that might put [them] to shame 3637-56 in [any] thing; 1697 and they [were] far 7350 from the Zidonians, 6722 and had no business 1697 with [any] man. 120

18:8 And they came 935-4 unto their brethren 251 to Zorah 6881 and Eshtaol: 847 and their brethren 251 said 559-4 unto them, What [say] ye?

18:9 And they said, 559-4 Arise, 6965-3 that we may go up 5927-4 against them: for we have seen 7200-1 the land, 776 and, behold, it [is] very 3966 good: 2896 and [are] ye still? 2814-56 be not slothful 6101-11 to go, 3212-2 [and] to enter 935-2 to possess 3423-2 the land. 776

18:10 When ye go, 935-2 ye shall come 935-4 unto a people 5971 secure, 982-6 and to a large 7342 land: 776 3027 for God 430 hath given 5414-1 it into your hands; 3027 a place 4725 where [there is] no want 4270 of any thing 1697 that [is] in the earth. 776

18:11 And there went 5265-4 from thence of the family 4940 of the Danites, 1839 out of Zorah 6881 and out of Eshtaol, 847 six 8337 hundred 3967 men 376 appointed 2296-7 with weapons 3627 of war. 4421

18:12 And they went up, 5927-4 and pitched 2583-4 in Kirjathjearim, 7157 in Judah: 3063 wherefore they called 7121-1 that place 4725 Mahanehdan 4265 unto this day: 3117 behold, [it is] behind 310 Kirjathjearim. 7157

18:13 And they passed 5674-4 thence unto mount 2022 Ephraim, 669 and came 935-4 unto the house 1004 of Micah. 4318

18:14 Then answered 6030-4 the five 2568 men 582 that went 1980-6 to spy out 7270-15 the country 776 of Laish, 3919 and said 559-4 unto their brethren, 251 Do ye know 3045-1 that there is 3426 in these houses 1004 an ephod, 646 and teraphim, 8655 and a graven image, 6459 and a molten image? 4541 now therefore consider 3045-3 what ye have to do. 6213-4

18:15 And they turned 5493-4 thitherward, and came 935-4 to the house 1004 of the young man 5288 the Levite, 3881 [even] unto the house 1004 of Micah, 4318 and saluted 7592-4 7965 him.

18:16 And the six 8337 hundred 3967 men 376 appointed 2296-7 with their weapons 3627 of war, 4421 which [were] of the children 1121 of Dan, 1835 stood 5324-12 by the entering 6607 of the gate. 8179

18:17 And the five 2568 men 582 that went 1980-6 to spy out 7270-15 the land 776 went up, 5927-4 [and] came in 935-1 thither, [and] took 3947-1 the graven image, 6459 and the ephod, 646 and the teraphim, 8655 and the molten image: 4541 and the priest 3548 stood 5324-12 in the entering 6607 of the gate 8179 with the six 8337 hundred 3967 men 376 [that were] appointed 2296-7 with weapons 3627 of war. 4421

18:18 And these went 935-1 into Micah's 4318 house, 1004 and fetched 3947-4 the carved image, 6459 the ephod, 646 and the teraphim, 8655 and the molten image. 4541 Then said 559-4 the priest 3548 unto them, What do 6213-6 ye?

18:19 And they said 559-4 unto him, Hold thy peace, 2790-54 lay 7760-3 thine hand 3027 upon thy mouth, 6310 and go 3212-3 with us, and be to us a father 1 and a priest: 3548 [is it] better 2896 for thee to be 1961-2 a priest 3548 unto the house 1004 of one 259 man, 376 or that thou be a priest 3548 unto a tribe 7626 and a family 4940 in Israel? 3478

18:20 And the priest's 3548 heart 3820 was glad, 3190-4 and he took 3947-4 the ephod, 646 and the teraphim, 8655 and the graven image, 6459 and went in 935-4 the midst 7130 of the people. 5971

18:21 So they turned 6437-4 and departed, 3212-4 and put 7760-4 the little ones 2945 and the cattle 4735 and the carriage 3520 before 6440 them.

18:22 [And] when they were a good way 7368-52 from the house 1004 of Micah, 4318 the men 582 that [were] in the houses 1004 near to Micah's 4318 house 1004 were gathered together, 2199-8 and overtook 1692-55 the children 1121 of Dan. 1835

18:23 And they cried 7121-4 unto the children 1121 of Dan. 1835 And they turned 5437-55 their faces, 6440 and said 559-4 unto Micah, 4318 What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company? 2199-8

18:24 And he said, 559-4 Ye have taken away 3947-1 my gods 430 which I made, 6213-1 and the priest, 3548 and ye are gone away: 3212-4 and what have I more? and what [is] this [that] ye say 559-4 unto me, What aileth thee?

18:25 And the children 1121 of Dan 1835 said 559-4 unto him, Let not thy voice 6963 be heard 8085-55 among us, lest angry 4751 5315 fellows 582 run 6293-4 upon thee, and thou lose 622-1 thy life, 5315 with the lives 5315 of thy household. 1004

18:26 And the children 1121 of Dan 1835 went 3212-4 their way: 1870 and when Micah 4318 saw 7200-4 that they [were] too strong 2389 for him, he turned 6437-4 and went back 7725-4 unto his house. 1004

18:27 And they took 3947-1 [the things] which Micah 4318 had made, 6213-1 and the priest 3548 which he had, and came 935-4 unto Laish, 3919 unto a people 5971 [that were] at quiet 8252-6 and secure: 982-6 and they smote 5221-55 them with the edge 6310 of the sword, 2719 and burnt 8313-1 the city 5892 with fire. 784

18:28 And [there was] no deliverer, 5337-56 because it [was] far 7350 from Zidon, 6721 and they had no business 1697 with [any] man; 120 and it was in the valley 6010 that [lieth] by Bethrehob. 1050 And they built 1129-4 a city, 5892 and dwelt 3427-4 therein.

18:29 And they called 7121-4 the name 8034 of the city 5892 Dan, 1835 after the name 8034 of Dan 1835 their father, 1 who was born 3205-27 unto Israel: 3478 howbeit 199 the name 8034 of the city 5892 [was] Laish 3919 at the first. 7223

18:30 And the children 1121 of Dan 1835 set up 6965-55 the graven image: 6459 and Jonathan, 3083 the son 1121 of Gershom, 1647 the son 1121 of Manasseh, 4519 he and his sons 1121 were priests 3548 to the tribe 7626 of Dan 1839 until the day 3117 of the captivity 1540-2 of the land. 776

18:31 And they set them up 7760-4 Micah's 4318 graven image, 6459 which he made, 6213-1 all the time 3117 that the house 1004 of God 430 was in Shiloh. 7887

19:1 And it came to pass in those days, 3117 when [there was] no king 4428 in Israel, 3478 that there was a certain 376 Levite 3881 sojourning 1481-6 on the side 3411 of mount 2022 Ephraim, 669 who took 3947-4 to him a concubine 802 6370 out of Bethlehemjudah. 1035 3063

19:2 And his concubine 6370 played the whore 2181-4 against him, and went away 3212-4 from him unto her father's 1 house 1004 to Bethlehemjudah, 1035 3063 and was there four 702 whole months. 2320 3117

19:3 And her husband 376 arose, 6965-4 and went 3212-4 after 310 her, to speak 1696-15 friendly 3820 unto her, [and] to bring her again, 7725-53 having his servant 5288 with him, and a couple 6776 of asses: 2543 and she brought 935-55 him into her father's 1 house: 1004 and when the father 1 of the damsel 5291 saw 7200-4 him, he rejoiced 8055-4 to meet 7125-2 him.

19:4 And his father in law, 2859-6 the damsel's 5291 father, 1 retained 2388-55 him; and he abode 3427-4 with him three 7969 days: 3117 so they did eat 398-4 and drink, 8354-4 and lodged 3885-4 there.

19:5 And it came to pass on the fourth 7243 day, 3117 when they arose early 7925-55 in the morning, 1242 that he rose up 6965-4 to depart: 3212-2 and the damsel's 5291 father 1 said 559-4 unto his son in law, 2860 Comfort 5582-3 thine heart 3820 with a morsel 6595 of bread, 3899 and afterward 310 go your way. 3212-4

19:6 And they sat down, 3427-4 and did eat 398-4 and drink 8354-4 both 8147 of them together: 3162 for the damsel's 5291 father 1 had said 559-4 unto the man, 376 Be content, 2974-54 I pray thee, and tarry all night, 3885-3 and let thine heart 3820 be merry. 3190-4

19:7 And when the man 376 rose up 6965-4 to depart, 3212-2 his father in law 2859-6 urged 6484-4 him: therefore he lodged 3885-4 there again. 7725-4

19:8 And he arose early 7925-55 in the morning 1242 on the fifth 2549 day 3117 to depart: 3212-2 and the damsel's 5291 father 1 said, 559-4 Comfort 5582-3 thine heart, 3824 I pray thee. And they tarried 4102-115 until afternoon, 3117 5186-2 and they did eat 398-4 both 8147 of them.

19:9 And when the man 376 rose up 6965-4 to depart, 3212-2 he, and his concubine, 6370 and his servant, 5288 his father in law, 2859-6 the damsel's 5291 father, 1 said 559-4 unto him, Behold, now the day 3117 draweth 7503-1 toward evening, 6150-2 I pray you tarry all night: 3885-3 behold, the day 3117 groweth to an end, 2583-2 lodge 3885-3 here, that thine heart 3824 may be merry; 3190-4 and to morrow 4279 get you early 7925-52 on your way, 1870 that thou mayest go 1980-1 home. 168

19:10 But the man 376 would 14-1 not tarry that night, 3885-2 but he rose up 6965-4 and departed, 3212-4 and came 935-4 over against 5227 Jebus, 2982 which [is] Jerusalem; 3389 and [there were] with him two 6776 asses 2543 saddled, 2280-7 his concubine 6370 also [was] with him.

19:11 [And] when they [were] by Jebus, 2982 the day 3117 was far 3966 spent; 7286-1 and the servant 5288 said 559-4 unto his master, 113 Come, 3212-3 I pray thee, and let us turn in 5493-4 into this city 5892 of the Jebusites, 2983 and lodge 3885-4 in it.

19:12 And his master 113 said 559-4 unto him, We will not turn aside 5493-4 hither into the city 5892 of a stranger, 5237 that [is] not of the children 1121 of Israel; 3478 we will pass over 5674-1 to Gibeah. 1390

19:13 And he said 559-4 unto his servant, 5288 Come, 3212-3 and let us draw near 7126-4 to one 259 of these places 4725 to lodge all night, 3885-1 in Gibeah, 1390 or in Ramah. 7414

19:14 And they passed on 5674-4 and went their way; 3212-4 and the sun 8121 went down 935-4 upon them [when they were] by 681 Gibeah, 1390 which [belongeth] to Benjamin. 1144

19:15 And they turned aside 5493-4 thither, to go in 935-2 [and] to lodge 3885-2 in Gibeah: 1390 and when he went in, 935-4 he sat him down 3427-4 in a street 7339 of the city: 5892 for [there was] no man 376 that took 622-18 them into his house 1004 to lodging. 3885-2

19:16 And, behold, there came 935-1 an old 2205 man 376 from his work 4639 out of the field 7704 at even, 6153 which [was] also 376 of mount 2022 Ephraim; 669 and he sojourned 1481-1 in Gibeah: 1390 but the men 582 of the place 4725 [were] Benjamites. 1121 3228

19:17 And when he had lifted up 5375-4 his eyes, 5869 he saw 7200-4 a wayfaring 732-6 man 376 in the street 7339 of the city: 5892 and the old 2205 man 376 said, 559-4 Whither goest 3212-4 thou? and whence 370 comest 935-4 thou?

19:18 And he said 559-4 unto him, We [are] passing 5674-6 from Bethlehemjudah 1035 3063 toward the side 3411 of mount 2022 Ephraim; 669 from thence [am] I: and I went 3212-4 to Bethlehemjudah, 1035 3063 but I [am now] going 1980-6 to the house 1004 of the LORD; 3068 and there [is] no man 376 that receiveth 622-18 me to house. 1004

19:19 Yet there is 3426 both straw 8401 and provender 4554 for our asses; 2543 and there is 3426 bread 3899 and wine 3196 also for me, and for thy handmaid, 519 and for the young man 5288 [which is] with thy servants: 5650 [there is] no want 4270 of any thing. 1697

19:20 And the old 2205 man 376 said, 559-4 Peace 7965 [be] with thee; howsoever 7535 [let] all thy wants 4270 [lie] upon me; only lodge 3885-4 not in the street. 7339

19:21 So he brought 935-55 him into his house, 1004 and gave provender 1101-4 unto the asses: 2543 and they washed 7364-4 their feet, 7272 and did eat 398-4 and drink. 8354-4

19:22 [Now] as they were making their hearts 3820 merry, 3190-56 behold, the men 582 of the city, 5892 certain 582 sons 1121 of Belial, 1100 beset the house 1004 round about, 5437-8 [and] beat 1849-102 at the door, 1817 and spake 559-4 to the master 1167 376 of the house, 1004 the old 2205 man, saying, 559-2 Bring forth 3318-54 the man 376 that came 935-1 into thine house, 1004 that we may know 3045-4 him.

19:23 And the man, 376 the master 1167 of the house, 1004 went out 3318-4 unto them, and said 559-4 unto them, Nay, 408 my brethren, 251 [nay], I pray you, do not [so] wickedly; 7489-55 seeing 310 that this man 376 is come 935-1 into mine house, 1004 do 6213-4 not this folly. 5039

19:24 Behold, [here is] my daughter 1323 a maiden, 1330 and his concubine; 6370 them I will bring out 3318-55 now, and humble 6031-16 ye them, and do 6213-3 with them what seemeth 5869 good 2896 unto you: but unto this man 376 do 6213-4 not so 2063 vile 5039 a thing. 1697

19:25 But the men 582 would 14-1 not hearken 8085-2 to him: so the man 376 took 2388-55 his concubine, 6370 and brought 3318-55 her forth 2351 unto them; and they knew 3045-4 her, and abused 5953-101 her all the night 3915 until the morning: 1242 and when the day 7837 began to spring, 5927-2 they let her go. 7971-17

19:26 Then came 935-4 the woman 802 in the dawning 6437-2 of the day, 1242 and fell down 5307-4 at the door 6607 of the man's 376 house 1004 where her lord 113 [was], till it was light. 216

19:27 And her lord 113 rose up 6965-4 in the morning, 1242 and opened 6605-4 the doors 1817 of the house, 1004 and went out 3318-4 to go 3212-2 his way: 1870 and, behold, the woman 802 his concubine 6370 was fallen down 5307-6 [at] the door 6607 of the house, 1004 and her hands 3027 [were] upon the threshold. 5592

19:28 And he said 559-4 unto her, Up, 6965-3 and let us be going. 3212-4 But none answered. 6030-6 Then the man 376 took 3947-4 her [up] upon an ass, 2543 and the man rose up, 6965-4 and gat 3212-4 him unto his place. 4725

19:29 And when he was come 935-4 into his house, 1004 he took 3947-4 a knife, 3979 and laid hold 2388-55 on his concubine, 6370 and divided 5408-17 her, [together] with her bones, 6106 into twelve 8147 6240 pieces, 5409 and sent 7971-17 her into all the coasts 1366 of Israel. 3478

19:30 And it was so, that all that saw 7200-6 it said, 559-1 There was 1961-8 no such deed 2063 done nor seen 7200-8 from the day 3117 that the children 1121 of Israel 3478 came up 5927-2 out of the land 776 of Egypt 4714 unto this day: 3117 consider 7760-3 of it, take advice, 5779-3 and speak 1696-16 [your minds].

20:1 Then all the children 1121 of Israel 3478 went out, 3318-4 and the congregation 5712 was gathered together 6950-11 as one 259 man, 376 from Dan 1835 even to Beersheba, 884 with the land 776 of Gilead, 1568 unto the LORD 3068 in Mizpeh. 4709

20:2 And the chief 6438 of all the people, 5971 [even] of all the tribes 7626 of Israel, 3478 presented 3320-101 themselves in the assembly 6951 of the people 5971 of God, 430 four 702 hundred 3967 thousand 505 footmen 376 7273 that drew 8025-6 sword. 2719

20:3 (Now the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 heard 8085-4 that the children 1121 of Israel 3478 were gone up 5927-1 to Mizpeh.) 4709 Then said 559-4 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 Tell 1696-16 [us], how was 1961-8 this wickedness? 7451

20:4 And the Levite, 3881 376 the husband 376 of the woman 802 that was slain, 7523-12 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 I came 935-1 into Gibeah 1390 that [belongeth] to Benjamin, 1144 I and my concubine, 6370 to lodge. 3885-2

20:5 And the men 1167 of Gibeah 1390 rose 6965-4 against me, and beset the house 1004 round about 5437-4 upon me by night, 3915 [and] thought 1819-14 to have slain 2026-2 me: and my concubine 6370 have they forced, 6031-14 that she is dead. 4191-4

20:6 And I took 270-4 my concubine, 6370 and cut her in pieces, 5408-17 and sent 7971-17 her throughout all the country 7704 of the inheritance 5159 of Israel: 3478 for they have committed 6213-1 lewdness 2154 and folly 5039 in Israel. 3478

20:7 Behold, ye [are] all children 1121 of Israel; 3478 give 3051-3 here 1988 your advice 1697 and counsel. 6098

20:8 And all the people 5971 arose 6965-4 as one 259 man, 376 saying, 559-2 We will not any 376 [of us] go 3212-4 to his tent, 168 neither will we any 376 [of us] turn 5493-4 into his house. 1004

20:9 But now this [shall be] the thing 1697 which we will do 6213-4 to Gibeah; 1390 [we will go up] by lot 1486 against it;

20:10 And we will take 3947-1 ten 6235 men 582 of an hundred 3967 throughout all the tribes 7626 of Israel, 3478 and an hundred 3967 of a thousand, 505 and a thousand 505 out of ten thousand, 7233 to fetch 3947-2 victual 6720 for the people, 5971 that they may do, 6213-2 when they come 935-2 to Gibeah 1387 of Benjamin, 1144 according to all the folly 5039 that they have wrought 6213-1 in Israel. 3478

20:11 So all the men 376 of Israel 3478 were gathered 622-11 against the city, 5892 knit together 2270 as one 259 man. 376

20:12 And the tribes 7626 of Israel 3478 sent 7971-4 men 582 through all the tribe 7626 of Benjamin, 1144 saying, 559-2 What wickedness 7451 [is] this that is done 1961-8 among you?

20:13 Now therefore deliver 5414-3 [us] the men, 582 the children 1121 of Belial, 1100 which [are] in Gibeah, 1390 that we may put them to death, 4191-55 and put away 1197-17 evil 7451 from Israel. 3478 But the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 would 14-1 not hearken 8085-2 to the voice 6963 of their brethren 251 the children 1121 of Israel: 3478

20:14 But the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 gathered 622-11 themselves together out of the cities 5892 unto Gibeah, 1390 to go out 3318-2 to battle 4421 against the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

20:15 And the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 were numbered 6485-101 at that time 3117 out of the cities 5892 twenty 6242 and six 8337 thousand 505 men 376 that drew 8025-6 sword, 2719 beside the inhabitants 3427-6 of Gibeah, 1390 which were numbered 6485-98 seven 7651 hundred 3967 chosen 977-7 men. 376

20:16 Among all this people 5971 [there were] seven 7651 hundred 3967 chosen 977-7 men 376 lefthanded; 334 3027 3225 every one could sling 7049-6 stones 68 at an hair 8185 [breadth], and not miss. 2398-55

20:17 And the men 376 of Israel, 3478 beside Benjamin, 1144 were numbered 6485-98 four 702 hundred 3967 thousand 505 men 376 that drew 8025-6 sword: 2719 all these [were] men 376 of war. 4421

20:18 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 arose, 6965-4 and went up 5927-4 to the house of God, 1008 and asked 7592-4 counsel of God, 430 and said, 559-4 Which 4310 of us shall go up 5927-4 first 8462 to the battle 4421 against the children 1121 of Benjamin? 1144 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 Judah 3063 [shall go up] first. 8462

20:19 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 rose up 6965-4 in the morning, 1242 and encamped 2583-4 against Gibeah. 1390

20:20 And the men 376 of Israel 3478 went out 3318-4 to battle 4421 against Benjamin; 1144 and the men 376 of Israel 3478 put themselves in array 6186-4 to fight 4421 against them at Gibeah. 1390

20:21 And the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 came forth 3318-4 out of Gibeah, 1390 and destroyed 7843-55 down to the ground 776 of the Israelites 3478 that day 3117 twenty 6242 and two 8147 thousand 505 men. 376

20:22 And the people 5971 the men 376 of Israel 3478 encouraged 2388-101 themselves, and set their battle 4421 again 3254-55 in array 6186-2 in the place 4725 where they put themselves in array 6186-1 the first 7223 day. 3117

20:23 (And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 went up 5927-4 and wept 1058-4 before 6440 the LORD 3068 until even, 6153 and asked 7592-4 counsel of the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 Shall I go up 5066-2 again 3254-55 to battle 4421 against the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 my brother? 251 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 Go up 5927-3 against him.)

20:24 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 came near 7126-4 against the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 the second 8145 day. 3117

20:25 And Benjamin 1144 went forth 3318-4 against 7125-2 them out of Gibeah 1390 the second 8145 day, 3117 and destroyed 7843-55 down to the ground 776 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 again eighteen 8083 6240 thousand 505 men; 376 all these drew 8025-6 the sword. 2719

20:26 Then all the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and all the people, 5971 went up, 5927-4 and came 935-4 unto the house of God, 1008 and wept, 1058-4 and sat 3427-4 there before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and fasted 6684-4 that day 3117 until even, 6153 and offered 5927-55 burnt offerings 5930 and peace offerings 8002 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

20:27 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 enquired 7592-4 of the LORD, 3068 (for the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of God 430 [was] there in those days, 3117

20:28 And Phinehas, 6372 the son 1121 of Eleazar, 499 the son 1121 of Aaron, 175 stood 5975-6 before 6440 it in those days,) 3117 saying, 559-2 Shall I yet again 3254-55 go out 3318-2 to battle 4421 against the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 my brother, 251 or shall I cease? 2308-4 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 Go up; 5927-3 for to morrow 4279 I will deliver 5414-4 them into thine hand. 3027

20:29 And Israel 3478 set 7760-4 liers in wait 693-6 round about 5439 Gibeah. 1390

20:30 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 went up 5927-4 against the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 on the third 7992 day, 3117 and put themselves in array 6186-4 against Gibeah, 1390 as at other times. 6471 6471

20:31 And the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 went out 3318-4 against 7125-2 the people, 5971 [and] were drawn away 5423-90 from the city; 5892 and they began 2490-55 to smite 5221-53 of the people, 5971 [and] kill, 2491 as at other times, 6471 6471 in the highways, 4546 of which one 259 goeth up 5927-6 to the house of God, 1008 and the other 259 to Gibeah 1390 in the field, 7704 about thirty 7970 men 376 of Israel. 3478

20:32 And the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 said, 559-4 They [are] smitten down 5062-12 before 6440 us, as at the first. 7223 But the children 1121 of Israel 3478 said, 559-1 Let us flee, 5127-4 and draw 5423-1 them from the city 5892 unto the highways. 4546

20:33 And all the men 376 of Israel 3478 rose up 6965-1 out of their place, 4725 and put themselves in array 6186-4 at Baaltamar: 1193 and the liers in wait 693-6 of Israel 3478 came forth 1518-56 out of their places, 4725 [even] out of the meadows 4629 of Gibeah. 1387

20:34 And there came 935-4 against 5048 Gibeah 1390 ten 6235 thousand 505 chosen 977-7 men 376 out of all Israel, 3478 and the battle 4421 was sore: 3513-1 but they knew 3045-1 not that evil 7451 [was] near 5060-6 them.

20:35 And the LORD 3068 smote 5062-4 Benjamin 1144 before 6440 Israel: 3478 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 destroyed 7843-55 of the Benjamites 1144 that day 3117 twenty 6242 and five 2568 thousand 505 and an hundred 3967 men: 376 all these drew 8025-6 the sword. 2719

20:36 So the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 saw 7200-4 that they were smitten: 5062-8 for the men 376 of Israel 3478 gave 5414-4 place 4725 to the Benjamites, 1144 because they trusted 982-1 unto the liers in wait 693-6 which they had set 7760-1 beside Gibeah. 1390

20:37 And the liers in wait 693-6 hasted, 2363-52 and rushed 6584-4 upon Gibeah; 1390 and the liers in wait 693-6 drew [themselves] along, 4900-4 and smote 5221-55 all the city 5892 with the edge 6310 of the sword. 2719

20:38 Now there was an appointed sign 4150 between the men 376 of Israel 3478 and 5973 the liers in wait, 693-6 that they should make a great 7235-54 flame 4864 with smoke 6227 rise up 5927-53 out of the city. 5892

20:39 And when the men 376 of Israel 3478 retired 2015-4 in the battle, 4421 Benjamin 1144 began 2490-52 to smite 5221-53 [and] kill 2491 of the men 376 of Israel 3478 about thirty 7970 persons: 376 for they said, 559-1 Surely 5062-9 they are smitten down 5062-12 before 6440 us, as [in] the first 7223 battle. 4421

20:40 But when the flame 4864 began 2490-52 to arise up 5927-2 out of the city 5892 with a pillar 5982 of smoke, 6227 the Benjamites 1144 looked 6437-4 behind 310 them, and, behold, the flame 3632 of the city 5892 ascended up 5927-1 to heaven. 8064

20:41 And when the men 376 of Israel 3478 turned 2015-1 again, the men 376 of Benjamin 1144 were amazed: 926-11 for they saw 7200-1 that evil 7451 was come 5060-1 upon them.

20:42 Therefore they turned 6437-4 [their backs] before 6440 the men 376 of Israel 3478 unto the way 1870 of the wilderness; 4057 but the battle 4421 overtook 1692-52 them; and them which [came] out of the cities 5892 they destroyed 7843-56 in the midst 8432 of them.

20:43 [Thus] they inclosed 3803-14 the Benjamites 1144 round about, 3803-14 [and] chased 7291-52 them, [and] trode them down 1869-52 with ease 4496 over against 5227 Gibeah 1390 toward the sunrising. 4217 8121

20:44 And there fell 5307-4 of Benjamin 1144 eighteen 8083 6240 thousand 505 men; 376 all these [were] men 582 of valour. 2428

20:45 And they turned 6437-4 and fled 5127-4 toward the wilderness 4057 unto the rock 5553 of Rimmon: 7417 and they gleaned 5953-25 of them in the highways 4546 five 2568 thousand 505 men; 376 and pursued hard 1692-55 after 310 them unto Gidom, 1440 and slew 5221-55 two thousand 505 men 376 of them.

20:46 So that all which fell 5307-6 that day 3117 of Benjamin 1144 were twenty 6242 and five 2568 thousand 505 men 376 that drew 8025-6 the sword; 2719 all these [were] men 582 of valour. 2428

20:47 But six 8337 hundred 3967 men 376 turned 6437-4 and fled 5127-4 to the wilderness 4057 unto the rock 5553 Rimmon, 7417 and abode 3427-4 in the rock 5553 Rimmon 7417 four 702 months. 2320

20:48 And the men 376 of Israel 3478 turned 7725-1 again upon the children 1121 of Benjamin, 1144 and smote 5221-55 them with the edge 6310 of the sword, 2719 as well the men 4974 of [every] city, 5892 as 5704 the beast, 929 and 5704 all that came to hand: 4672-12 also they set 7971-14 on fire 784 all the cities 5892 that they came to. 4672-12

21:1 Now the men 376 of Israel 3478 had sworn 7650-8 in Mizpeh, 4709 saying, 559-2 There shall not any 376 of us give 5414-4 his daughter 1323 unto Benjamin 1144 to wife. 802

21:2 And the people 5971 came 935-4 to the house of God, 1008 and abode 3427-4 there till even 6153 before 6440 God, 430 and lifted up 5375-4 their voices, 6963 and wept 1058-4 sore; 1065 1419

21:3 And said, 559-4 O LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 why is this come to pass in Israel, 3478 that there should be to day 3117 one 259 tribe 7626 lacking 6485-9 in Israel? 3478

21:4 And it came to pass on the morrow, 4283 that the people 5971 rose early, 7925-55 and built 1129-4 there an altar, 4196 and offered 5927-55 burnt offerings 5930 and peace offerings. 8002

21:5 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 said, 559-4 Who [is there] among all the tribes 7626 of Israel 3478 that came not up 5927-1 with the congregation 6951 unto the LORD? 3068 For they had made a great 1419 oath 7621 concerning him that 834 came not up 5927-1 to the LORD 3068 to Mizpeh, 4709 saying, 559-2 He shall surely 4191-2 be put to death. 4191-93

21:6 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 repented 5162-11 them for Benjamin 1144 their brother, 251 and said, 559-4 There is one 259 tribe 7626 cut off 1438-8 from Israel 3478 this day. 3117

21:7 How shall we do 6213-4 for wives 802 for them that remain, 3498-12 seeing we have sworn 7650-8 by the LORD 3068 that we will not give 5414-2 them of our daughters 1323 to wives? 802

21:8 And they said, 559-4 What one 259 [is there] of the tribes 7626 of Israel 3478 that came not up 5927-1 to Mizpeh 4709 to the LORD? 3068 And, behold, there came 935-1 none 376 to the camp 4264 from Jabeshgilead 3003 1568 to the assembly. 6951

21:9 For the people 5971 were numbered, 6485-101 and, behold, [there were] none 376 of the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jabeshgilead 3003 1568 there.

21:10 And the congregation 5712 sent 7971-4 thither twelve 8147 6240 thousand 505 men 376 of the valiantest, 1121 2428 and commanded 6680-17 them, saying, 559-2 Go 3212-3 and smite 5221-52 the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jabeshgilead 3003 1568 with the edge 6310 of the sword, 2719 with the women 802 and the children. 2945

21:11 And this [is] the thing 1697 that ye shall do, 6213-4 Ye shall utterly destroy 2763-55 every male, 2145 and every woman 802 that hath 3045-6 lain 4904 by man. 2145

21:12 And they found 4672-4 among the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jabeshgilead 3003 1568 four 702 hundred 3967 young 5291 virgins, 1330 that had known 3045-1 no man 376 by lying 4904 with any male: 2145 and they brought 935-55 them unto the camp 4264 to Shiloh, 7887 which [is] in the land 776 of Canaan. 3667

21:13 And the whole congregation 5712 sent 7971-4 [some] to speak 1696-17 to the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 that [were] in the rock 5553 Rimmon, 7417 and to call 7121-4 peaceably 7965 unto them.

21:14 And Benjamin 1144 came again 7725-4 at that time; 6256 and they gave 5414-4 them wives 802 which they had saved alive 2421-14 of the women 802 of Jabeshgilead: 3003 1568 and yet so they sufficed 4672-1 them not.

21:15 And the people 5971 repented 5162-12 them for Benjamin, 1144 because that the LORD 3068 had made 6213-1 a breach 6556 in the tribes 7626 of Israel. 3478

21:16 Then the elders 2205 of the congregation 5712 said, 559-4 How shall we do 6213-4 for wives 802 for them that remain, 3498-12 seeing the women 802 are destroyed 8045-8 out of Benjamin? 1144

21:17 And they said, 559-4 [There must be] an inheritance 3425 for them that be escaped 6413 of Benjamin, 1144 that a tribe 7626 be not destroyed 4229-11 out of Israel. 3478

21:18 Howbeit we may 3201-4 not give 5414-2 them wives 802 of our daughters: 1323 for the children 1121 of Israel 3478 have sworn, 7650-8 saying, 559-2 Cursed 779-7 [be] he that giveth 5414-6 a wife 802 to Benjamin. 1144

21:19 Then they said, 559-4 Behold, [there is] a feast 2282 of the LORD 3068 in Shiloh 7887 yearly 3117 3117 [in a place] which [is] on the north 6828 side of Bethel, 1008 on the east side 4217 8121 of the highway 4546 that goeth up 5927-6 from Bethel 1008 to Shechem, 7927 and on the south 5045 of Lebonah. 3829

21:20 Therefore they commanded 6680-17 the children 1121 of Benjamin, 1144 saying, 559-2 Go 3212-3 and lie in wait 693-1 in the vineyards; 3754

21:21 And see, 7200-1 and, behold, if the daughters 1323 of Shiloh 7887 come out 3318-4 to dance 2342-2 in dances, 4246 then come ye out 3318-1 of the vineyards, 3754 and catch 2414-1 you every man 376 his wife 802 of the daughters 1323 of Shiloh, 7887 and go 1980-1 to the land 776 of Benjamin. 1144

21:22 And it shall be, when their fathers 1 or their brethren 251 come 935-4 unto us to complain, 7378-2 that we will say 559-1 unto them, Be favourable 2603-3 unto them for our sakes: because we reserved 3947-1 not to each man 376 his wife 802 in the war: 4421 for ye did not give 5414-1 unto them at this time, 6256 [that] ye should be guilty. 816-4

21:23 And the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 did 6213-4 so, and took 5375-4 [them] wives, 802 according to their number, 4557 of them that danced, 2342-35 whom they caught: 1497-1 and they went 3212-4 and returned 7725-4 unto their inheritance, 5159 and repaired 1129-4 the cities, 5892 and dwelt 3427-4 in them.

21:24 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 departed 1980-101 thence at that time, 6256 every man 376 to his tribe 7626 and to his family, 4940 and they went out 3318-4 from thence every man 376 to his inheritance. 5159

21:25 In those days 3117 [there was] no king 4428 in Israel: 3478 every man 376 did 6213-4 [that which was] right 3477 in his own eyes. 5869
