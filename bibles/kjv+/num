4:43 From thirty 7970 years 8141 old 1121 and upward 4605 even unto fifty 2572 years 8141 old, 1121 every one that entereth 935-6 into the service, 6635 for the work 5656 in the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150

4:44 Even those that were numbered 6485-7 of them after their families, 4940 were three 7969 thousand 505 and two hundred. 3967

4:45 These [be] those that were numbered 6485-7 of the families 4940 of the sons 1121 of Merari, 4847 whom Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 numbered 6485-1 according to the word 6310 of the LORD 3068 by the hand 3027 of Moses. 4872

4:46 All those that were numbered 6485-7 of the Levites, 3881 whom Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 and the chief 5387 of Israel 3478 numbered, 6485-1 after their families, 4940 and after the house 1004 of their fathers, 1

4:47 From thirty 7970 years 8141 old 1121 and upward 4605 even unto fifty 2572 years 8141 old, 1121 every one that came 935-6 to do 5647-2 the service 5656 of the ministry, and the service 5656 of the burden 4853 in the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150

4:48 Even those that were numbered 6485-7 of them, were eight 8083 thousand 505 and five 2568 hundred 3967 and fourscore. 8084

4:49 According to the commandment 6310 of the LORD 3068 they were numbered 6485-1 by the hand 3027 of Moses, 4872 every 376 one 376 according to his service, 5656 and according to his burden: 4853 thus were they numbered 6485-7 of him, as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

5:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

5:2 Command 6680-16 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 that they put out 7971-17 of the camp 4264 every leper, 6879-7 and every one that hath an issue, 2100-6 and whosoever is defiled 2931 by the dead: 5315

5:3 Both male 2145 and female 5347 shall ye put out, 7971-17 without 2351 the camp 4264 shall ye put 7971-17 them; that they defile 2930-17 not their camps, 4264 in the midst 8432 whereof 834 I dwell. 7931-6

5:4 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did 6213-4 so, and put them out 7971-17 without 2351 the camp: 4264 as the LORD 3068 spake 1696-14 unto Moses, 4872 so did 6213-1 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

5:5 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

5:6 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 When a man 376 or woman 802 shall commit 6213-4 any sin 2403 that men 120 commit, to do 4603-2 a trespass 4604 against the LORD, 3068 and that person 5315 be guilty; 816-1

5:7 Then they shall confess 3034-98 their sin 2403 which they have done: 6213-1 and he shall recompense 7725-52 his trespass 817 with the principal 7218 thereof, and add 3254-55 unto it the fifth 2549 [part] thereof, and give 5414-1 [it] unto [him] against whom he hath trespassed. 816-1

5:8 But if the man 376 have no kinsman 1350-6 to recompense 7725-53 the trespass 817 unto, let the trespass 817 be recompensed 7725-94 unto the LORD, 3068 [even] to the priest; 3548 beside the ram 352 of the atonement, 3725 whereby an atonement 3722-17 shall be made for him.

5:9 And every offering 8641 of all the holy things 6944 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 which they bring 7126-55 unto the priest, 3548 shall be his.

5:10 And every man's 376 hallowed things 6944 shall be his: whatsoever any man 376 giveth 5414-4 the priest, 3548 it shall be his.

5:11 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

5:12 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, If any 376 man's 376 wife 802 go aside, 7847-4 and commit 4603-1 a trespass 4604 against him,

5:13 And a man 376 lie 7901-1 with her carnally, 7902 2233 and it be hid 5956-8 from the eyes 5869 of her husband, 376 and be kept close, 5641-8 and she be defiled, 2930-8 and [there be] no witness 5707 against her, neither she be taken 8610-8 [with the manner];

5:14 And the spirit 7307 of jealousy 7068 come 5674-1 upon him, and he be jealous 7065-14 of his wife, 802 and she be defiled: 2930-8 or if the spirit 7307 of jealousy 7068 come 5674-1 upon him, and he be jealous 7065-14 of his wife, 802 and she be not defiled: 2930-8

5:15 Then shall the man 376 bring 935-52 his wife 802 unto the priest, 3548 and he shall bring 935-52 her offering 7133 for her, the tenth 6224 [part] of an ephah 374 of barley 8184 meal; 7058 he shall pour 3332-4 no oil 8081 upon it, nor put 5414-4 frankincense 3828 thereon; for it [is] an offering 4503 of jealousy, 7068 an offering 4503 of memorial, 2146 bringing iniquity 5771 to remembrance. 2142-56

5:16 And the priest 3548 shall bring her near, 7126-52 and set 5975-52 her before 6440 the LORD: 3068

5:17 And the priest 3548 shall take 3947-1 holy 6918 water 4325 in an earthen 2789 vessel; 3627 and of the dust 6083 that is in the floor 7172 of the tabernacle 4908 the priest 3548 shall take, 3947-4 and put 5414-1 [it] into the water: 4325

5:18 And the priest 3548 shall set 5975-52 the woman 802 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and uncover 6544-1 the woman's 802 head, 7218 and put 5414-1 the offering 4503 of memorial 2146 in her hands, 3709 which [is] the jealousy 7068 offering: 4503 and the priest 3548 shall have in his hand 3027 the bitter 4751 water 4325 that causeth the curse: 779-18

5:19 And the priest 3548 shall charge her by an oath, 7650-52 and say 559-1 unto the woman, 802 If no man 376 have lain 7901-1 with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside 7847-1 to uncleanness 2932 [with another] instead of thy husband, 376 be thou free 5352-10 from this bitter 4751 water 4325 that causeth the curse: 779-18

5:20 But if thou hast gone aside 7847-1 [to another] instead of thy husband, 376 and if thou be defiled, 2930-8 and some man 376 have 5414-4 lain 7903 with thee beside 1107 thine husband: 376

5:21 Then the priest 3548 shall charge 7650-52 the woman 802 with an oath 7621 of cursing, 423 and the priest 3548 shall say 559-1 unto the woman, 802 The LORD 3068 make 5414-4 thee a curse 423 and an oath 7621 among 8432 thy people, 5971 when the LORD 3068 doth make 5414-2 thy thigh 3409 to rot, 5307-6 and thy belly 990 to swell; 6639

5:22 And this water 4325 that causeth the curse 779-18 shall go 935-1 into thy bowels, 4578 to make [thy] belly 990 to swell, 6638-53 and [thy] thigh 3409 to rot: 5307-53 And the woman 802 shall say, 559-1 Amen, 543 amen. 543

5:23 And the priest 3548 shall write 3789-1 these curses 423 in a book, 5612 and he shall blot [them] out 4229-1 with the bitter 4751 water: 4325

5:24 And he shall cause the woman 802 to drink 8248-52 the bitter 4751 water 4325 that causeth the curse: 779-18 and the water 4325 that causeth the curse 779-18 shall enter 935-1 into her, [and become] bitter. 4751

5:25 Then the priest 3548 shall take 3947-1 the jealousy 7068 offering 4503 out of the woman's 802 hand, 3027 and shall wave 5130-52 the offering 4503 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and offer 7126-52 it upon the altar: 4196

5:26 And the priest 3548 shall take an handful 7061-1 of the offering, 4503 [even] the memorial 234 thereof, and burn 6999-52 [it] upon the altar, 4196 and afterward 310 shall cause the woman 802 to drink 8248-55 the water. 4325

5:27 And when he hath made her to drink 8248-52 the water, 4325 then it shall come to pass, [that], if she be defiled, 2930-8 and have done 4603-4 trespass 4604 against her husband, 376 that the water 4325 that causeth the curse 779-18 shall enter 935-1 into her, [and become] bitter, 4751 and her belly 990 shall swell, 6638-1 and her thigh 3409 shall rot: 5307-1 and the woman 802 shall be a curse 423 among 7130 her people. 5971

5:28 And if the woman 802 be not defiled, 2930-8 but be clean; 2889 then she shall be free, 5352-8 and shall conceive 2232-8 seed. 2233

5:29 This [is] the law 8451 of jealousies, 7068 when a wife 802 goeth aside 7847-4 [to another] instead of her husband, 376 and is defiled; 2930-8

5:30 Or when the spirit 7307 of jealousy 7068 cometh 5674-4 upon him, 376 and he be jealous 7065-14 over his wife, 802 and shall set 5975-52 the woman 802 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and the priest 3548 shall execute 6213-1 upon her all this law. 8451

5:31 Then shall the man 376 be guiltless 5352-8 from iniquity, 5771 and this 1931 woman 802 shall bear 5375-4 her iniquity. 5771

6:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

6:2 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, When either man 376 or woman 802 shall separate 6381-55 [themselves] to vow 5087-2 a vow 5088 of a Nazarite, 5139 to separate 5144-53 [themselves] unto the LORD: 3068

6:3 He shall separate 5144-55 [himself] from wine 3196 and strong drink, 7941 and shall drink 8354-4 no vinegar 2558 of wine, 3196 or vinegar 2558 of strong drink, 7941 neither shall he drink 8354-4 any liquor 4952 of grapes, 6025 nor eat 398-4 moist 3892 grapes, 6025 or dried. 3002

6:4 All the days 3117 of his separation 5145 shall he eat 398-4 nothing that is made 6213-11 of the vine 3196 tree, 1612 from the kernels 2785 even to the husk. 2085

6:5 All the days 3117 of the vow 5088 of his separation 5145 there shall no razor 8593 come 5674-4 upon his head: 7218 until the days 3117 be fulfilled, 4390-2 in the which he separateth 5144-55 [himself] unto the LORD, 3068 he shall be holy, 6918 [and] shall let the locks 6545 of the hair 8181 of his head 7218 grow. 1431-15

6:6 All the days 3117 that he separateth 5144-53 [himself] unto the LORD 3068 he shall come 935-4 at no dead 4191-5 body. 5315

6:7 He shall not make himself unclean 2930-101 for his father, 1 or for his mother, 517 for his brother, 251 or for his sister, 269 when they die: 4194 because the consecration 5145 of his God 430 [is] upon his head. 7218

6:8 All the days 3117 of his separation 5145 he [is] holy 6918 unto the LORD. 3068

6:9 And if any man 4191-5 die 4191-4 very 6621 suddenly 6597 by him, and he hath defiled 2930-14 the head 7218 of his consecration; 5145 then he shall shave 1548-14 his head 7218 in the day 3117 of his cleansing, 2893 on the seventh 7637 day 3117 shall he shave 1548-17 it.

6:10 And on the eighth 8066 day 3117 he shall bring 935-55 two 8147 turtles, 8449 or two 8147 young 1121 pigeons, 3123 to the priest, 3548 to the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation: 4150

6:11 And the priest 3548 shall offer 6213-1 the one 259 for a sin offering, 2403 and the other 259 for a burnt offering, 5930 and make an atonement 3722-14 for him, for that 834 he sinned 2398-1 by the dead, 5315 and shall hallow 6942-14 his head 7218 that same day. 3117

6:12 And he shall consecrate 5144-52 unto the LORD 3068 the days 3117 of his separation, 5145 and shall bring 935-52 a lamb 3532 of the first 1121 year 8141 for a trespass offering: 817 but the days 3117 that were before 7223 shall be lost, 5307-4 because his separation 5145 was defiled. 2930-1

6:13 And this [is] the law 8451 of the Nazarite, 5139 when the days 3117 of his separation 5145 are fulfilled: 4390-2 3117 he shall be brought 935-55 unto the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation: 4150

6:14 And he shall offer 7126-52 his offering 7133 unto the LORD, 3068 one 259 he lamb 3532 of the first 1121 year 8141 without blemish 8549 for a burnt offering, 5930 and one 259 ewe lamb 3535 of the first 1323 year 8141 without blemish 8549 for a sin offering, 2403 and one 259 ram 352 without blemish 8549 for peace offerings, 8002

6:15 And a basket 5536 of unleavened bread, 4682 cakes 2471 of fine flour 5560 mingled 1101-7 with oil, 8081 and wafers 7550 of unleavened bread 4682 anointed 4886-7 with oil, 8081 and their meat offering, 4503 and their drink offerings. 5262

6:16 And the priest 3548 shall bring 7126-52 [them] before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and shall offer 6213-1 his sin offering, 2403 and his burnt offering: 5930

6:17 And he shall offer 6213-4 the ram 352 [for] a sacrifice 2077 of peace offerings 8002 unto the LORD, 3068 with the basket 5536 of unleavened bread: 4682 the priest 3548 shall offer 6213-1 also his meat offering, 4503 and his drink offering. 5262

6:18 And the Nazarite 5139 shall shave 1548-14 the head 7218 of his separation 5145 [at] the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and shall take 3947-1 the hair 8181 of the head 7218 of his separation, 5145 and put 5414-1 [it] in the fire 784 which [is] under the sacrifice 2077 of the peace offerings. 8002

6:19 And the priest 3548 shall take 3947-1 the sodden 1311 shoulder 2220 of the ram, 352 and one 259 unleavened 4682 cake 2471 out of the basket, 5536 and one 259 unleavened 4682 wafer, 7550 and shall put 5414-1 [them] upon the hands 3709 of the Nazarite, 5139 after 310 [the hair of] his separation 5145 is shaven: 1548-99

6:20 And the priest 3548 shall wave 5130-52 them [for] a wave offering 8573 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 this [is] holy 6944 for the priest, 3548 with the wave 8573 breast 2373 and heave 8641 shoulder: 7785 and after 310 that the Nazarite 5139 may drink 8354-4 wine. 3196

6:21 This [is] the law 8451 of the Nazarite 5139 who hath vowed, 5087-4 [and of] his offering 7133 unto the LORD 3068 for his separation, 5145 beside [that] that his hand 3027 shall get: 5381-55 according 6310 to the vow 5088 which he vowed, 5087-4 so he must do 6213-4 after the law 8451 of his separation. 5145

6:22 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

6:23 Speak 1696-16 unto Aaron 175 and unto his sons, 1121 saying, 559-2 On this wise 3541 ye shall bless 1288-17 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying 559-2 unto them,

6:24 The LORD 3068 bless 1288-17 thee, and keep 8104-4 thee:

6:25 The LORD 3068 make his face 6440 shine 215-55 upon thee, and be gracious 2603-4 unto thee:

6:26 The LORD 3068 lift up 5375-4 his countenance 6440 upon thee, and give 7760-4 thee peace. 7965

6:27 And they shall put 7760-1 my name 8034 upon the children 1121 of Israel; 3478 and I will bless 1288-17 them.

7:1 And it came to pass on the day 3117 that Moses 4872 had fully 3615-15 set up 6965-53 the tabernacle, 4908 and had anointed 4886-4 it, and sanctified 6942-17 it, and all the instruments 3627 thereof, both the altar 4196 and all the vessels 3627 thereof, and had anointed 4886-4 them, and sanctified 6942-17 them;

7:2 That the princes 5387 of Israel, 3478 heads 7218 of the house 1004 of their fathers, 1 who [were] the princes 5387 of the tribes, 4294 and were 5975-6 over them that were numbered, 6485-7 offered: 7126-55

7:3 And they brought 935-55 their offering 7133 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 six 8337 covered 6632 wagons, 5699 and twelve 6240 8147 oxen; 1241 a wagon 5699 for two 8147 of the princes, 5387 and for each one 259 an ox: 7794 and they brought 7126-55 them before 6440 the tabernacle. 4908

7:4 And the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

7:5 Take 3947-3 [it] of them, that they may be to do 5647-2 the service 5656 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation; 4150 and thou shalt give 5414-1 them unto the Levites, 3881 to every man 376 according 6310 to his service. 5656

7:6 And Moses 4872 took 3947-4 the wagons 5699 and the oxen, 1241 and gave 5414-4 them unto the Levites. 3881

7:7 Two 8147 wagons 5699 and four 702 oxen 1241 he gave 5414-1 unto the sons 1121 of Gershon, 1648 according 6310 to their service: 5656

7:8 And four 702 wagons 5699 and eight 8083 oxen 1241 he gave 5414-1 unto the sons 1121 of Merari, 4847 according 6310 unto their service, 5656 under the hand 3027 of Ithamar 385 the son 1121 of Aaron 175 the priest. 3548

7:9 But unto the sons 1121 of Kohath 6955 he gave 5414-1 none: 3808 because the service 5656 of the sanctuary 6944 belonging unto them [was that] they should bear 5375-4 upon their shoulders. 3802

7:10 And the princes 5387 offered 7126-55 for dedicating 2598 of the altar 4196 in the day 3117 that it was anointed, 4886-9 even the princes 5387 offered 7126-55 their offering 7133 before 6440 the altar. 4196

7:11 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 They shall offer 7126-55 their offering, 7133 each 259 prince 5387 5387 on his day, 3117 3117 for the dedicating 2598 of the altar. 4196

7:12 And he that offered 7126-56 his offering 7133 the first 7223 day 3117 was Nahshon 5177 the son 1121 of Amminadab, 5992 of the tribe 4294 of Judah: 3063

7:13 And his offering 7133 [was] one 259 silver 3701 charger, 7086 the weight 4948 thereof [was] an hundred 3967 and thirty 7970 [shekels], one 259 silver 3701 bowl 4219 of seventy 7657 shekels, 8255 after the shekel 8255 of the sanctuary; 6944 both 8147 of them [were] full 4392 of fine flour 5560 mingled 1101-7 with oil 8081 for a meat offering: 4503

7:14 One 259 spoon 3709 of ten 6235 [shekels] of gold, 2091 full 4392 of incense: 7004

7:15 One 259 young 6499 1121 bullock, 1241 one 259 ram, 352 one 259 lamb 3532 of the first 1121 year, 8141 for a burnt offering: 5930

7:16 One 259 kid 8163 of the goats 5795 for a sin offering: 2403

8:12 And the Levites 3881 shall lay 5564-4 their hands 3027 upon the heads 7218 of the bullocks: 6499 and thou shalt offer 6213-3 the one 259 [for] a sin offering, 2403 and the other 259 [for] a burnt offering, 5930 unto the LORD, 3068 to make an atonement 3722-15 for the Levites. 3881

8:15 And after 310 that shall the Levites 3881 go in 935-4 to do the service 5647-2 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation: 4150 and thou shalt cleanse 2891-14 them, and offer 5130-52 them [for] an offering. 8573

8:16 For they [are] wholly 5414-7 given 5414-7 unto me from among 8432 the children 1121 of Israel; 3478 instead of such as open 6363 every womb, 7358 [even instead of] the firstborn 1060 of all the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 have I taken 3947-1 them unto me.

8:17 For all the firstborn 1060 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 [are] mine, [both] man 120 and beast: 929 on the day 3117 that I smote 5221-53 every firstborn 1060 in the land 776 of Egypt 4714 I sanctified 6942-52 them for myself.

8:18 And I have taken 3947-4 the Levites 3881 for all the firstborn 1060 of the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

8:19 And I have given 5414-4 the Levites 3881 [as] a gift 5414-7 to Aaron 175 and to his sons 1121 from among 8432 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 to do 5647-2 the service 5656 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 in the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and to make an atonement 3722-15 for the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 that there be no plague 5063 among the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 when the children 1121 of Israel 3478 come nigh 5066-2 unto the sanctuary. 6944

8:20 And Moses, 4872 and Aaron, 175 and all the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 did 6213-4 to the Levites 3881 according unto all that the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses 4872 concerning the Levites, 3881 so did 6213-1 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 unto them.

8:21 And the Levites 3881 were purified, 2398-101 and they washed 3526-17 their clothes; 899 and Aaron 175 offered 5130-55 them [as] an offering 8573 before 6440 the LORD; 3068 and Aaron 175 made an atonement 3722-17 for them to cleanse 2891-15 them.

8:22 And after 310 that went 935-1 the Levites 3881 in to do 5647-2 their service 5656 in the tabernacle 168 of the congregation 4150 before 6440 Aaron, 175 and before 6440 his sons: 1121 as the LORD 3068 had commanded 6680-14 Moses 4872 concerning the Levites, 3881 so did 6213-1 they unto them.

8:23 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

8:24 This [is it] that [belongeth] unto the Levites: 3881 from twenty 6242 and five 2568 years 8141 old 1121 and upward 4605 they shall go in 935-4 to wait 6633-2 upon the service 6635 5656 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation: 4150

8:25 And from the age 1121 of fifty 2572 years 8141 they shall cease 7725-4 waiting 6635 upon the service 5656 [thereof], and shall serve 5647-4 no more:

8:26 But shall minister 8334-14 with their brethren 251 in the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 to keep 8104-2 the charge, 4931 and shall do 5647-4 no service. 5656 Thus shalt thou do 6213-4 unto the Levites 3881 touching their charge. 4931

9:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses 4872 in the wilderness 4057 of Sinai, 5514 in the first 7223 month 2320 of the second 8145 year 8141 after they were come out 3318-2 of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 saying, 559-2

9:2 Let the children 1121 of Israel 3478 also keep 6213-4 the passover 6453 at his appointed season. 4150

9:3 In the fourteenth 702 6240 day 3117 of this month, 2320 at even, 6153 ye shall keep 6213-4 it in his appointed season: 4150 according to all the rites 2708 of it, and according to all the ceremonies 4941 thereof, shall ye keep 6213-4 it.

9:4 And Moses 4872 spake 1696-17 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 that they should keep 6213-2 the passover. 6453

9:5 And they kept 6213-4 the passover 6453 on the fourteenth 702 6240 day 3117 of the first 7223 month 2320 at even 6153 in the wilderness 4057 of Sinai: 5514 according to all that the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses, 4872 so did 6213-1 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

9:6 And there were certain men, 582 who were defiled 2931 by the dead body 5315 of a man, 120 that they could 3201-1 not keep 6213-2 the passover 6453 on that day: 3117 and they came 7126-4 before 6440 Moses 4872 and before 6440 Aaron 175 on that day: 3117

9:7 And those 1992 men 582 said 559-4 unto him, We [are] defiled 2931 by the dead body 5315 of a man: 120 wherefore are we kept back, 1639-11 that we may not offer 7126-53 an offering 7133 of the LORD 3068 in his appointed season 4150 among 8432 the children 1121 of Israel? 3478

9:8 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto them, Stand still, 5975-3 and I will hear 8085-4 what the LORD 3068 will command 6680-17 concerning you.

9:9 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

9:10 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 If any 376 man 376 of you or of your posterity 1755 shall be unclean 2931 by reason of a dead body, 5315 or [be] in a journey 1870 afar off, 7350 yet he shall keep 6213-1 the passover 6453 unto the LORD. 3068

9:11 The fourteenth 702 6240 day 3117 of the second 8145 month 2320 at even 6153 they shall keep 6213-4 it, [and] eat 398-4 it with unleavened bread 4682 and bitter 4844 [herbs].

9:12 They shall leave 7604-55 none of it unto the morning, 1242 nor break 7665-4 any bone 6106 of it: according to all the ordinances 2708 of the passover 6453 they shall keep 6213-4 it.

9:13 But the man 376 that [is] clean, 2889 and is not in a journey, 1870 and forbeareth 2308-1 to keep 6213-2 the passover, 6453 even the same soul 5315 shall be cut off 3772-8 from among his people: 5971 because he brought 7126-52 not the offering 7133 of the LORD 3068 in his appointed season, 4150 that man 376 shall bear 5375-4 his sin. 2399

9:14 And if a stranger 1616 shall sojourn 1481-4 among you, and will keep 6213-1 the passover 6453 unto the LORD; 3068 according to the ordinance 2708 of the passover, 6453 and according to the manner 4941 thereof, so shall he do: 6213-4 ye shall have one 259 ordinance, 2708 both for the stranger, 1616 and for him that was born 249 in the land. 776

9:15 And on the day 3117 that the tabernacle 4908 was reared up 6965-53 the cloud 6051 covered 3680-14 the tabernacle, 4908 [namely], the tent 168 of the testimony: 5715 and at even 6153 there was upon the tabernacle 4908 as it were the appearance 4758 of fire, 784 until the morning. 1242

9:16 So it was alway: 8548 the cloud 6051 covered 3680-17 it [by day], and the appearance 4758 of fire 784 by night. 3915

9:17 And when 6310 the cloud 6051 was taken up 5927-9 from the tabernacle, 168 then after 310 that the children 1121 of Israel 3478 journeyed: 5265-4 and in the place 4725 where the cloud 6051 abode, 7931-4 there the children 1121 of Israel 3478 pitched their tents. 2583-4

9:18 At the commandment 6310 of the LORD 3068 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 journeyed, 5265-4 and at the commandment 6310 of the LORD 3068 they pitched: 2583-4 as long as 3117 the cloud 6051 abode 7931-4 upon the tabernacle 4908 they rested 2583-4 in their tents.

9:19 And when the cloud 6051 tarried long 748-53 upon the tabernacle 4908 many 7227 days, 3117 then the children 1121 of Israel 3478 kept 8104-1 the charge 4931 of the LORD, 3068 and journeyed 5265-4 not.

9:20 And [so] it was, 3426 when the cloud 6051 was a few 4557 days 3117 upon the tabernacle; 4908 according to the commandment 6310 of the LORD 3068 they abode 2583-4 in their tents, and according to the commandment 6310 of the LORD 3068 they journeyed. 5265-4

9:21 And [so] it was, 3426 when the cloud 6051 abode from even 6153 unto the morning, 1242 and [that] the cloud 6051 was taken up 5927-8 in the morning, 1242 then they journeyed: 5265-1 whether [it was] by day 3119 or by night 3915 that the cloud 6051 was taken up, 5927-8 they journeyed. 5265-1

9:22 Or [whether it were] two days, 3117 or a month, 2320 or a year, 3117 that the cloud 6051 tarried 748-53 upon the tabernacle, 4908 remaining 7931-2 thereon, the children 1121 of Israel 3478 abode 2583-4 in their tents, and journeyed 5265-4 not: but when it was taken up, 5927-9 they journeyed. 5265-4

9:23 At the commandment 6310 of the LORD 3068 they rested 2583-4 in the tents, and at the commandment 6310 of the LORD 3068 they journeyed: 5265-4 they kept 8104-1 the charge 4931 of the LORD, 3068 at the commandment 6310 of the LORD 3068 by the hand 3027 of Moses. 4872

10:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

10:2 Make 6213-3 thee two 8147 trumpets 2689 of silver; 3701 of a whole piece 4749 shalt thou make 6213-4 them: that thou mayest use 1961-1 them for the calling 4744 of the assembly, 5712 and for the journeying 4550 of the camps. 4264

10:3 And when they shall blow 8628-1 with them, 2004 all the assembly 5712 shall assemble 3259-8 themselves to thee at the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150

10:4 And if they blow 8628-4 [but] with one 259 [trumpet], then the princes, 5387 [which are] heads 7218 of the thousands 505 of Israel, 3478 shall gather 3259-8 themselves unto thee.

10:5 When ye blow 8628-1 an alarm, 8643 then the camps 4264 that lie 2583-6 on the east parts 6924 shall go forward. 5265-1

10:6 When ye blow 8628-1 an alarm 8643 the second time, 8145 then the camps 4264 that lie 2583-6 on the south side 8486 shall take their journey: 5265-1 they shall blow 8628-4 an alarm 8643 for their journeys. 4550

10:7 But when the congregation 6951 is to be gathered together, 6950-53 ye shall blow, 8628-4 but ye shall not sound an alarm. 7321-55

10:8 And the sons 1121 of Aaron, 175 the priests, 3548 shall blow 8628-4 with the trumpets; 2689 and they shall be to you for an ordinance 2708 for ever 5769 throughout your generations. 1755

10:9 And if ye go 935-4 to war 4421 in your land 776 against the enemy 6862 that oppresseth 6887-6 you, then ye shall blow an alarm 7321-52 with the trumpets; 2689 and ye shall be remembered 2142-8 before 6440 the LORD 3068 your God, 430 and ye shall be saved 3467-8 from your enemies. 341-6

10:10 Also in the day 3117 of your gladness, 8057 and in your solemn days, 4150 and in the beginnings 7218 of your months, 2320 ye shall blow 8628-1 with the trumpets 2689 over your burnt offerings, 5930 and over the sacrifices 2077 of your peace offerings; 8002 that they may be to you for a memorial 2146 before 6440 your God: 430 I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

10:11 And it came to pass on the twentieth 6242 [day] of the second 8145 month, 2320 2320 in the second 8145 year, 8141 that the cloud 6051 was taken up 5927-8 from off the tabernacle 4908 of the testimony. 5715

10:12 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 took 5265-4 their journeys 4550 out of the wilderness 4057 of Sinai; 5514 and the cloud 6051 rested 7931-4 in the wilderness 4057 of Paran. 6290

10:13 And they first 7223 took their journey 5265-4 according to the commandment 6310 of the LORD 3068 by the hand 3027 of Moses. 4872

10:14 In the first 7223 [place] went 5265-4 the standard 1714 of the camp 4264 of the children 1121 of Judah 3063 according to their armies: 6635 and over his host 6635 [was] Nahshon 5177 the son 1121 of Amminadab. 5992

10:15 And over the host 6635 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Issachar 3485 [was] Nethaneel 5417 the son 1121 of Zuar. 6686

10:16 And over the host 6635 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Zebulun 2074 [was] Eliab 446 the son 1121 of Helon. 2497

10:17 And the tabernacle 4908 was taken down; 3381-90 and the sons 1121 of Gershon 1648 and the sons 1121 of Merari 4847 set forward, 5265-1 bearing 5375-6 the tabernacle. 4908

10:18 And the standard 1714 of the camp 4264 of Reuben 7205 set forward 5265-1 according to their armies: 6635 and over his host 6635 [was] Elizur 468 the son 1121 of Shedeur. 7707

10:19 And over the host 6635 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Simeon 8095 [was] Shelumiel 8017 the son 1121 of Zurishaddai. 6701

10:20 And over the host 6635 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Gad 1410 [was] Eliasaph 460 the son 1121 of Deuel. 1845

10:21 And the Kohathites 6956 set forward, 5265-1 bearing 5375-6 the sanctuary: 4720 and [the other] did set up 6965-52 the tabernacle 4908 against they came. 935-2

10:22 And the standard 1714 of the camp 4264 of the children 1121 of Ephraim 669 set forward 5265-1 according to their armies: 6635 and over his host 6635 [was] Elishama 476 the son 1121 of Ammihud. 5989

10:23 And over the host 6635 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Manasseh 4519 [was] Gamaliel 1583 the son 1121 of Pedahzur. 6301

10:24 And over the host 6635 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 [was] Abidan 27 the son 1121 of Gideoni. 1441

10:25 And the standard 1714 of the camp 4264 of the children 1121 of Dan 1835 set forward, 5265-1 [which was] the rereward 622-18 of all the camps 4264 throughout their hosts: 6635 and over his host 6635 [was] Ahiezer 295 the son 1121 of Ammishaddai. 5996

10:26 And over the host 6635 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Asher 836 [was] Pagiel 6295 the son 1121 of Ocran. 5918

10:27 And over the host 6635 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Naphtali 5321 [was] Ahira 299 the son 1121 of Enan. 5881

10:28 Thus 428 [were] the journeyings 4550 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 according to their armies, 6635 when they set forward. 5265-4

10:29 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto Hobab, 2246 the son 1121 of Raguel 7467 the Midianite, 4084 Moses' 4872 father in law, 2859-6 We are journeying 5265-6 unto the place 4725 of which the LORD 3068 said, 559-1 I will give 5414-4 it you: come 3212-3 thou with us, and we will do thee good: 2895-52 for the LORD 3068 hath spoken 1696-14 good 2896 concerning Israel. 3478

10:30 And he said 559-4 unto him, I will not go; 3212-4 but I will depart 3212-4 to mine own land, 776 and to my kindred. 4138

10:31 And he said, 559-4 Leave 5800-4 us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as 3651 thou knowest 3045-1 how we are to encamp 2583-2 in the wilderness, 4057 and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes. 5869

10:32 And it shall be, if thou go 3212-4 with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness 2896 the LORD 3068 shall do 3190-55 unto us, the same will we do 2895-52 unto thee.

10:33 And they departed 5265-4 from the mount 2022 of the LORD 3068 three 7969 days' 3117 journey: 1870 and the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 went 5265-6 before 6440 them in the three 7969 days' 3117 journey, 1870 to search out 8446-2 a resting place 4496 for them.

10:34 And the cloud 6051 of the LORD 3068 [was] upon them by day, 3119 when they went out 5265-2 of the camp. 4264

10:35 And it came to pass, when the ark 727 set forward, 5265-2 that Moses 4872 said, 559-4 Rise up, 6965-3 LORD, 3068 and let thine enemies 341-6 be scattered; 6327-4 and let them that hate 8130-18 thee flee 5127-4 before 6440 thee.

10:36 And when it rested, 5117-2 he said, 559-4 Return, 7725-3 O LORD, 3068 unto the many 7233 thousands 505 of Israel. 3478

11:1 And [when] the people 5971 complained, 596-102 it displeased 7451 241 the LORD: 3068 and the LORD 3068 heard 8085-4 [it]; and his anger 639 was kindled; 2734-4 and the fire 784 of the LORD 3068 burnt 1197-4 among them, and consumed 398-4 [them that were] in the uttermost parts 7097 of the camp. 4264

11:2 And the people 5971 cried 6817-4 unto Moses; 4872 and when Moses 4872 prayed 6419-101 unto the LORD, 3068 the fire 784 was quenched. 8257-4

11:3 And he called 7121-4 the name 8034 of the place 1931 4725 Taberah: 8404 because the fire 784 of the LORD 3068 burnt 1197-1 among them.

11:4 And the mixt multitude 628 that [was] among 7130 them fell a lusting: 183-98 8378 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 also wept 1058-4 again, 7725-4 and said, 559-4 Who shall give us flesh 1320 to eat? 398-55

11:5 We remember 2142-1 the fish, 1710 which we did eat 398-4 in Egypt 4714 freely; 2600 the cucumbers, 7180 and the melons, 20 and the leeks, 2682 and the onions, 1211 and the garlick: 7762

11:6 But now our soul 5315 [is] dried away: 3002 [there is] nothing at all, beside 1115 this manna, 4478 [before] our eyes. 5869

11:7 And the manna 4478 [was] as coriander 1407 seed, 2233 and the colour 5869 thereof as the colour 5869 of bdellium. 916

11:8 [And] the people 5971 went about, 7751-1 and gathered 3950-1 [it], and ground 2912-1 [it] in mills, 7347 or beat 1743-1 [it] in a mortar, 4085 and baked 1310-14 [it] in pans, 6517 and made 6213-1 cakes 5692 of it: and the taste 2940 of it was as the taste 2940 of fresh 3955 oil. 8081

11:9 And when the dew 2919 fell 3381-2 upon the camp 4264 in the night, 3915 the manna 4478 fell 3381-4 upon it.

11:10 Then Moses 4872 heard 8085-4 the people 5971 weep 1058-6 throughout their families, 4940 every man 376 in the door 6607 of his tent: 168 and the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 was kindled 2734-4 greatly; 3966 Moses 4872 also was displeased. 7489-1 5869

11:11 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto the LORD, 3068 Wherefore hast thou afflicted 7489-52 thy servant? 5650 and wherefore have I not found 4672-1 favour 2580 in thy sight, 5869 that thou layest 7760-2 the burden 4853 of all this people 5971 upon me?

11:12 Have I conceived 2029-1 all this people? 5971 have I begotten 3205-1 them, that thou shouldest say 559-4 unto me, Carry 5375-3 them in thy bosom, 2436 as a nursing father 539-6 beareth 5375-4 the sucking child, 3243-6 unto the land 127 which thou swarest 7650-8 unto their fathers? 1

11:13 Whence 370 should I have flesh 1320 to give 5414-2 unto all this people? 5971 for they weep 1058-4 unto me, saying, 559-2 Give 5414-3 us flesh, 1320 that we may eat. 398-4

11:14 I am not able 3201-4 to bear 5375-2 all this people 5971 alone, 905 because [it is] too heavy 3515 for me.

11:15 And if thou deal 6213-6 thus with me, kill 2026-3 me, I pray thee, out of hand, 2026-2 if I have found 4672-1 favour 2580 in thy sight; 5869 and let me not see 7200-4 my wretchedness. 7451

11:16 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Gather 622-3 unto me seventy 7657 men 376 of the elders 2205 of Israel, 3478 whom thou knowest 3045-1 to be the elders 2205 of the people, 5971 and officers 7860-6 over them; and bring 3947-1 them unto the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 that they may stand 3320-98 there with thee.

11:17 And I will come down 3381-1 and talk 1696-14 with thee there: and I will take 680-1 of the spirit 7307 which [is] upon thee, and will put 7760-1 [it] upon them; and they shall bear 5375-1 the burden 4853 of the people 5971 with thee, that thou bear 5375-4 [it] not thyself alone.

11:18 And say 559-4 thou unto the people, 5971 Sanctify 6942-100 yourselves against to morrow, 4279 and ye shall eat 398-1 flesh: 1320 for ye have wept 1058-1 in the ears 241 of the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 Who shall give us flesh 1320 to eat? 398-55 for [it was] well 2895-1 with us in Egypt: 4714 therefore the LORD 3068 will give 5414-1 you flesh, 1320 and ye shall eat. 398-1

11:19 Ye shall not eat 398-4 one 259 day, 3117 nor two days, 3117 nor five 2568 days, 3117 neither ten 6235 days, 3117 nor twenty 6242 days; 3117

11:20 [But] even a whole month, 2320 3117 until it come out 3318-4 at your nostrils, 639 and it be loathsome 2214 unto you: because 3282 that ye have despised 3988-1 the LORD 3068 which [is] among 7130 you, and have wept 1058-4 before 6440 him, saying, 559-2 Why came we forth 3318-1 out of Egypt? 4714

11:21 And Moses 4872 said, 559-4 The people, 5971 among 7130 whom I [am], [are] six 8337 hundred 3967 thousand 505 footmen; 7273 and thou hast said, 559-1 I will give 5414-4 them flesh, 1320 that they may eat 398-1 a whole month. 2320 3117

11:22 Shall the flocks 6629 and the herds 1241 be slain 7819-11 for them, to suffice 4672-1 them? or shall all the fish 1709 of the sea 3220 be gathered 622-11 together for them, to suffice 4672-1 them?

11:23 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Is the LORD'S 3068 hand 3027 waxed short? 7114-4 thou shalt see 7200-4 now whether my word 1697 shall come to pass 7136-4 unto thee or not.

11:24 And Moses 4872 went out, 3318-4 and told 1696-17 the people 5971 the words 1697 of the LORD, 3068 and gathered 622-4 the seventy 7657 men 376 of the elders 2205 of the people, 5971 and set 5975-55 them round about 5439 the tabernacle. 168

11:25 And the LORD 3068 came down 3381-4 in a cloud, 6051 and spake 1696-17 unto him, and took 680-55 of the spirit 7307 that [was] upon him, and gave 5414-4 [it] unto the seventy 7657 elders: 2205 376 and it came to pass, [that], when the spirit 7307 rested 5117-2 upon them, they prophesied, 5012-101 and did not cease. 3254-1

11:26 But there remained 7604-11 two 8147 [of the] men 582 in the camp, 4264 the name 8034 of the one 259 [was] Eldad, 419 and the name 8034 of the other 8145 Medad: 4312 and the spirit 7307 rested 5117-4 upon them; and they [were] of them that were written, 3789-7 but went not out 3318-1 unto the tabernacle: 168 and they prophesied 5012-101 in the camp. 4264

11:27 And there ran 7323-4 a young man, 5288 and told 5046-55 Moses, 4872 and said, 559-4 Eldad 419 and Medad 4312 do prophesy 5012-102 in the camp. 4264

11:28 And Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun, 5126 the servant 8334-18 of Moses, 4872 [one] of his young men, 979 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 My lord 113 Moses, 4872 forbid 3607-3 them.

11:29 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto him, Enviest 7065-18 thou for my sake? would God 5414-4 that all the LORD'S 3068 people 5971 were prophets, 5030 [and] that the LORD 3068 would put 5414-4 his spirit 7307 upon them!

11:30 And Moses 4872 gat 622-11 him into the camp, 4264 he and the elders 2205 of Israel. 3478

11:31 And there went forth 5265-1 a wind 7307 from the LORD, 3068 and brought 1468-4 quails 7958 from the sea, 3220 and let [them] fall 5203-4 by the camp, 4264 as it were a day's 3117 journey 1870 on this side, 3541 and as it were a day's 3117 journey 1870 on the other side, 3541 round about 5439 the camp, 4264 and as it were two cubits 520 [high] upon the face 6440 of the earth. 776

11:32 And the people 5971 stood up 6965-4 all that day, 3117 and all [that] night, 3915 and all the next 4283 day, 3117 and they gathered 622-4 the quails: 7958 he that gathered least 4591-56 gathered 622-1 ten 6235 homers: 2563 and they spread 7849-4 [them] all abroad 7849-2 for themselves round about 5439 the camp. 4264

11:33 And while the flesh 1320 [was] yet between their teeth, 8127 ere 2962 it was chewed, 3772-11 the wrath 639 of the LORD 3068 was kindled 2734-1 against the people, 5971 and the LORD 3068 smote 5221-55 the people 5971 with a very 3966 great 7227 plague. 4347

11:34 And he called 7121-4 the name 8034 of that place 4725 Kibrothhattaavah: 6914 because there they buried 6912-1 the people 5971 that lusted. 183-102

11:35 [And] the people 5971 journeyed 5265-1 from Kibrothhattaavah 6914 unto Hazeroth; 2698 and abode at Hazeroth. 2698

12:1 And Miriam 4813 and Aaron 175 spake 1696-17 against Moses 4872 because of 182 the Ethiopian 3569 woman 802 whom he had married: 3947-1 for he had married 3947-1 an Ethiopian 3569 woman. 802

12:2 And they said, 559-4 Hath the LORD 3068 indeed spoken 1696-14 only by Moses? 4872 hath he not spoken 1696-14 also by us? And the LORD 3068 heard 8085-4 [it].

12:3 (Now the man 376 Moses 4872 [was] very 3966 meek, 6035|6035-k above all the men 120 which [were] upon the face 6440 of the earth.) 127

12:4 And the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 suddenly 6597 unto Moses, 4872 and unto Aaron, 175 and unto Miriam, 4813 Come out 3318-3 ye three 7969 unto the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150 And they three 7969 came out. 3318-4

12:5 And the LORD 3068 came down 3381-4 in the pillar 5982 of the cloud, 6051 and stood 5975-4 [in] the door 6607 of the tabernacle, 168 and called 7121-4 Aaron 175 and Miriam: 4813 and they both 8147 came forth. 3318-4

12:6 And he said, 559-4 Hear 8085-3 now my words: 1697 If there be a prophet 5030 among you, [I] the LORD 3068 will make myself known 3045-101 unto him in a vision, 4759 [and] will speak 1696-17 unto him in a dream. 2472

12:7 My servant 5650 Moses 4872 [is] not so, who [is] faithful 539-12 in all mine house. 1004

12:8 With him will I speak 1696-17 mouth 6310 to mouth, 6310 even apparently, 4758 and not in dark speeches; 2420 and the similitude 8544 of the LORD 3068 shall he behold: 5027-55 wherefore then were ye not afraid 3372-1 to speak 1696-15 against my servant 5650 Moses? 4872

12:9 And the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 was kindled 2734-4 against them; and he departed. 3212-4

12:10 And the cloud 6051 departed 5493-1 from off the tabernacle; 168 and, behold, Miriam 4813 [became] leprous, 6879-30 [white] as snow: 7950 and Aaron 175 looked 6437-4 upon Miriam, 4813 and, behold, [she was] leprous. 6879-30

12:11 And Aaron 175 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Alas, 994 my lord, 113 I beseech thee, lay 7896-4 not the sin 2403 upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, 2973-8 and wherein we have sinned. 2398-1

12:12 Let 4994 her not be as one dead, 4191-5 of whom the flesh 1320 is half 2677 consumed 398-11 when he cometh out 3318-2 of his mother's 517 womb. 7358

12:13 And Moses 4872 cried 6817-4 unto the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 Heal 7495-3 her now, O God, 410 I beseech thee.

12:14 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 If her father 1 had but 3417-2 spit 3417-1 in her face, 6440 should she not be ashamed 3637-11 seven 7651 days? 3117 let her be shut 5462-11 out 2351 from the camp 4264 seven 7651 days, 3117 and after 310 that let her be received 622-11 in [again].

12:15 And Miriam 4813 was shut 5462-11 out 2351 from the camp 4264 seven 7651 days: 3117 and the people 5971 journeyed 5265-1 not till Miriam 4813 was brought 622-9 in [again].

12:16 And afterward 310 the people 5971 removed 5265-1 from Hazeroth, 2698 and pitched 2583-4 in the wilderness 4057 of Paran. 6290

13:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

13:2 Send 7971-3 thou men, 582 that they may search 8446-4 the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 which I give 5414-6 unto the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 of every tribe 4294 of their fathers 1 shall ye send 7971-4 a 259 man, 376 376 every one a ruler 5387 among them.

13:3 And Moses 4872 by the commandment 6310 of the LORD 3068 sent 7971-4 them from the wilderness 4057 of Paran: 6290 all those men 582 [were] heads 7218 of the children 1121 of Israel. 3478 1992

13:4 And these [were] their names: 8034 of the tribe 4294 of Reuben, 7205 Shammua 8051 the son 1121 of Zaccur. 2139

13:5 Of the tribe 4294 of Simeon, 8095 Shaphat 8202 the son 1121 of Hori. 2753

13:6 Of the tribe 4294 of Judah, 3063 Caleb 3612 the son 1121 of Jephunneh. 3312

13:7 Of the tribe 4294 of Issachar, 3485 Igal 3008 the son 1121 of Joseph. 3130

13:8 Of the tribe 4294 of Ephraim, 669 Oshea 1954 the son 1121 of Nun. 5126

13:9 Of the tribe 4294 of Benjamin, 1144 Palti 6406 the son 1121 of Raphu. 7505

13:10 Of the tribe 4294 of Zebulun, 2074 Gaddiel 1427 the son 1121 of Sodi. 5476

13:11 Of the tribe 4294 of Joseph, 3130 [namely], of the tribe 4294 of Manasseh, 4519 Gaddi 1426 the son 1121 of Susi. 5485

13:12 Of the tribe 4294 of Dan, 1835 Ammiel 5988 the son 1121 of Gemalli. 1582

13:13 Of the tribe 4294 of Asher, 836 Sethur 5639 the son 1121 of Michael. 4317

13:14 Of the tribe 4294 of Naphtali, 5321 Nahbi 5147 the son 1121 of Vophsi. 2058

13:15 Of the tribe 4294 of Gad, 1410 Geuel 1345 the son 1121 of Machi. 4352

13:16 These [are] the names 8034 of the men 582 which Moses 4872 sent 7971-1 to spy out 8446-2 the land. 776 And Moses 4872 called 7121-4 Oshea 1954 the son 1121 of Nun 5126 Jehoshua. 3091

13:17 And Moses 4872 sent 7971-4 them to spy out 8446-2 the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 and said 559-4 unto them, Get you up 5927-3 this [way] southward, 5045 and go up 5927-1 into the mountain: 2022

13:18 And see 7200-1 the land, 776 what it [is]; and the people 5971 that dwelleth 3427-6 therein, whether they [be] strong 2389 or weak, 7504 few 4592 or many; 7227

13:19 And what the land 776 [is] that they dwell 3427-6 in, whether it [be] good 2896 or bad; 7451 and what cities 5892 [they be] that they dwell 3427-6 in, 2007 whether in tents, 4264 or in strong holds; 4013

13:20 And what the land 776 [is], whether it [be] fat 8082 or lean, 7330 whether there be 3426 wood 6086 therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, 2388-98 and bring 3947-1 of the fruit 6529 of the land. 776 Now the time 3117 [was] the time 3117 of the firstripe 1061 grapes. 6025

13:21 So they went up, 5927-4 and searched 8446-4 the land 776 from the wilderness 4057 of Zin 6790 unto Rehob, 7340 as men come 935-2 to Hamath. 2574

13:22 And they ascended 5927-4 by the south, 5045 and came 935-4 unto Hebron; 2275 where Ahiman, 289 Sheshai, 8344 and Talmai, 8526 the children 3211 of Anak, 6061 [were]. (Now Hebron 2275 was built 1129-8 seven 7651 years 8141 before 6440 Zoan 6814 in Egypt.) 4714

13:23 And they came 935-4 unto the brook 5158 of Eshcol, 812 and cut down 3772-4 from thence a branch 2156 with one 259 cluster 811 of grapes, 6025 and they bare 5375-4 it between two 8147 upon a staff; 4132 and [they brought] of the pomegranates, 7416 and of the figs. 8384

13:24 The place 4725 was called 7121-1 the brook 5158 Eshcol, 812 because of 182 the cluster of grapes 811 which the children 1121 of Israel 3478 cut down 3772-1 from thence.

13:25 And they returned 7725-4 from searching 8446-2 of the land 776 after 7093 forty 705 days. 3117

13:26 And they went 3212-4 and came 935-4 to Moses, 4872 and to Aaron, 175 and to all the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 unto the wilderness 4057 of Paran, 6290 to Kadesh; 6946 and brought back 7725-55 word 1697 unto them, and unto all the congregation, 5712 and shewed 7200-55 them the fruit 6529 of the land. 776

13:27 And they told 5608-17 him, and said, 559-4 We came 935-1 unto the land 776 whither thou sentest 7971-1 us, and surely it floweth 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey; 1706 and this [is] the fruit 6529 of it.

13:28 Nevertheless 657 the people 5971 [be] strong 5794 that dwell 3427-6 in the land, 776 and the cities 5892 [are] walled, 1219-7 [and] very 3966 great: 1419 and moreover we saw 7200-1 the children 3211 of Anak 6061 there.

13:29 The Amalekites 6002 dwell 3427-6 in the land 776 of the south: 5045 and the Hittites, 2850 and the Jebusites, 2983 and the Amorites, 567 dwell 3427-6 in the mountains: 2022 and the Canaanites 3669 dwell 3427-6 by the sea, 3220 and by the coast 3027 of Jordan. 3383

13:30 And Caleb 3612 stilled 2013-55 the people 5971 before Moses, 4872 and said, 559-4 Let us go up 5927-4 at once, 5927-2 and possess 3423-1 it; for we are well able 3201-4 to overcome 3201-2 it.

13:31 But the men 582 that went up 5927-1 with him said, 559-1 We be not able 3201-4 to go up 5927-2 against the people; 5971 for they [are] stronger 2389 than we.

13:32 And they brought up 3318-55 an evil report 1681 of the land 776 which they had searched 8446-1 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 The land, 776 through which we have gone 5674-1 to search 8446-2 it, [is] a land 776 that eateth up 398-6 the inhabitants 3427-6 thereof; and all the people 5971 that we saw 7200-1 in it 8432 [are] men 582 of a great stature. 4060

13:33 And there we saw 7200-1 the giants, 5303 the sons 1121 of Anak, 6061 [which come] of the giants: 5303 and we were in our own sight 5869 as grasshoppers, 2284 and so we were in their sight. 5869

14:1 And all the congregation 5712 lifted up 5375-4 5414-4 their voice, 6963 and cried; and the people 5971 wept 1058-4 that night. 3915

14:2 And all the children 1121 of Israel 3478 murmured 3885-11 against Moses 4872 and against Aaron: 175 and the whole congregation 5712 said 559-4 unto them, Would God that 3863 we had died 4191-1 in the land 776 of Egypt! 4714 or would God 3863 we had died 4191-1 in this wilderness! 4057

14:3 And wherefore hath the LORD 3068 brought 935-56 us unto this land, 776 to fall 5307-2 by the sword, 2719 that our wives 802 and our children 2945 should be a prey? 957 were it not better 2896 for us to return 7725-2 into Egypt? 4714

14:4 And they said 559-4 one 376 to another, 251 Let us make 5414-4 a captain, 7218 and let us return 7725-4 into Egypt. 4714

14:5 Then Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 fell 5307-4 on their faces 6440 before 6440 all the assembly 6951 of the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

14:6 And Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun, 5126 and Caleb 3612 the son 1121 of Jephunneh, 3312 [which were] of them that searched 8446-6 the land, 776 rent 7167-1 their clothes: 899

14:7 And they spake 559-4 unto all the company 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 The land, 776 which we passed 5674-1 through to search 8446-2 it, [is] an exceeding 3966 3966 good 2896 land. 776

14:8 If the LORD 3068 delight 2654-1 in us, then he will bring 935-52 us into this land, 776 and give 5414-1 it us; a land 776 which floweth 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey. 1706

14:9 Only rebel 4775-4 not ye against the LORD, 3068 neither fear 3372-4 ye the people 5971 of the land; 776 for they [are] bread 3899 for us: their defence 6738 is departed 5493-1 from them, and the LORD 3068 [is] with us: fear 3372-4 them not.

14:10 But all the congregation 5712 bade 559-4 stone 7275-2 them with stones. 68 And the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 appeared 7200-8 in the tabernacle 168 of the congregation 4150 before all the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

14:11 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 How long will this people 5971 provoke 5006-17 me? and how long will it be ere 3808 they believe 539-55 me, for all the signs 226 which I have shewed 6213-1 among 7130 them?

14:12 I will smite 5221-55 them with the pestilence, 1698 and disinherit 3423-55 them, and will make 6213-4 of thee a greater 1419 nation 1471 and mightier 6099 than they.

14:13 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto the LORD, 3068 Then the Egyptians 4714 shall hear 8085-1 [it], (for thou broughtest up 5927-52 this people 5971 in thy might 3581 from among 7130 them;)

14:14 And they will tell 559-1 [it] to the inhabitants 3427-6 of this land: 776 [for] they have heard 8085-1 that thou LORD 3068 [art] among 7130 this people, 5971 that thou LORD 3068 art seen 7200-8 face 5869 to face, 5869 and [that] thy cloud 6051 standeth 5975-6 over them, and [that] thou goest 1980-6 before 6440 them, by day time 3119 in a pillar 5982 of a cloud, 6051 and in a pillar 5982 of fire 784 by night. 3915

14:15 Now [if] thou shalt kill 4191-52 [all] this people 5971 as one 259 man, 376 then the nations 1471 which have heard 8085-1 the fame 8088 of thee will speak, 559-1 saying, 559-2

14:16 Because the LORD 3068 was not 1115 able 3201-2 to bring 935-53 this people 5971 into the land 776 which he sware 7650-8 unto them, therefore he hath slain 7819-4 them in the wilderness. 4057

14:17 And now, I beseech thee, let the power 3581 of my Lord 136 be great, 1431-4 according 834 as thou hast spoken, 1696-14 saying, 559-2

14:18 The LORD 3068 [is] longsuffering, 750 639 and of great 7227 mercy, 2617 forgiving 5375-6 iniquity 5771 and transgression, 6588 and by no means 5352-15 clearing 5352-17 [the guilty], visiting 6485-6 the iniquity 5771 of the fathers 1 upon the children 1121 unto the third 8029 and fourth 7256 [generation].

14:19 Pardon, 5545-3 I beseech thee, the iniquity 5771 of this people 5971 according unto the greatness 1433 of thy mercy, 2617 and as thou hast forgiven 5375-1 this people, 5971 from Egypt 4714 even until now. 2008

14:20 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 I have pardoned 5545-1 according to thy word: 1697

14:21 But [as] truly 199 [as] I live, 2416 all the earth 776 shall be filled 4390-11 with the glory 3519 of the LORD. 3068

14:22 Because all those men 582 which have seen 7200-6 my glory, 3519 and my miracles, 226 which I did 6213-1 in Egypt 4714 and in the wilderness, 4057 and have tempted 5254-17 me 853 now these ten 6235 times, 6471 and have not hearkened 8085-1 to my voice; 6963

14:23 Surely they shall not 518 see 7200-4 the land 776 which I sware 7650-8 unto their fathers, 1 neither shall any of them that provoked 5006-18 me see 7200-4 it:

14:24 But my servant 5650 Caleb, 3612 because 6118 he had another 312 spirit 7307 with him, and hath followed 310 me fully, 4390-17 him will I bring 935-52 into the land 776 whereinto he went; 935-1 and his seed 2233 shall possess 3423-55 it.

14:25 (Now the Amalekites 6003 and the Canaanites 3669 dwelt 3427-6 in the valley.) 6010 To morrow 4279 turn 6437-3 you, and get 5265-3 you into the wilderness 4057 by the way 1870 of the Red 5488 sea. 3220

14:26 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses 4872 and unto Aaron, 175 saying, 559-2

14:27 How long [shall I bear with] this evil 7451 congregation, 5712 which murmur 3885-56 against me? I have heard 8085-1 the murmurings 8519 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 which they murmur 3885-56 against me.

14:28 Say 559-3 unto them, [As truly as] 3808 I live, 2416 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 as ye have spoken 1696-14 in mine ears, 241 so will I do 6213-4 to you:

14:29 Your carcases 6297 shall fall 5307-4 in this wilderness; 4057 and all that were numbered 6485-7 of you, according to your whole number, 4557 from twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 and upward, 4605 which have murmured 3885-52 against me,

14:30 Doubtless ye shall not 518 come 935-4 into the land, 776 [concerning] which I sware 3027 5375-1 to make you dwell 7931-15 therein, save Caleb 3612 the son 1121 of Jephunneh, 3312 and Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun. 5126

14:31 But your little ones, 2945 which ye said 559-1 should be a prey, 957 them will I bring in, 935-52 and they shall know 3045-1 the land 776 which ye have despised. 3988-1

14:32 But [as for] you, your carcases, 6297 they shall fall 5307-4 in this wilderness. 4057

14:33 And your children 1121 shall wander 7462-6 in the wilderness 4057 forty 705 years, 8141 and bear 5375-1 your whoredoms, 2184 until your carcases 6297 be wasted 8552-2 in the wilderness. 4057

14:34 After the number 4557 of the days 3117 in which ye searched 8446-1 the land, 776 [even] forty 705 days, 3117 each day 3117 8141 for a year, 3117 8141 shall ye bear 5375-4 your iniquities, 5771 [even] forty 705 years, 8141 and ye shall know 3045-1 my breach of promise. 8569

14:35 I the LORD 3068 have said, 1696-14 I will surely 518 3808 do 6213-4 it 2063 unto all this evil 7451 congregation, 5712 that are gathered together 3259-12 against me: in this wilderness 4057 they shall be consumed, 8552-11 and there they shall die. 4191-4

14:36 And the men, 582 which Moses 4872 sent 7971-1 to search 8446-2 the land, 776 who returned, 7725-4 and made all the congregation 5712 to murmur 3885-55|3885-11 against him, by bringing up 3318-53 a slander 1681 upon the land, 776

14:37 Even those men 582 that did bring up 3318-56 the evil 7451 report 1681 upon the land, 776 died 4191-4 by the plague 4046 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

14:38 But Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun, 5126 and Caleb 3612 the son 1121 of Jephunneh, 3312 [which were] of the men 1992 582 that went 1980-6 to search 8446-2 the land, 776 lived 2421-1 [still].

14:39 And Moses 4872 told 1696-17 these sayings 1697 unto all the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 and the people 5971 mourned 56-101 greatly. 3966

14:40 And they rose up early 7925-55 in the morning, 1242 and gat them up 5927-4 into the top 7218 of the mountain, 2022 saying, 559-2 Lo, 2009 we [be here], and will go up 5927-1 unto the place 4725 which the LORD 3068 hath promised: 559-1 for we have sinned. 2398-1

14:41 And Moses 4872 said, 559-4 Wherefore now do ye transgress 5674-6 the commandment 6310 of the LORD? 3068 but it shall not prosper. 6743-4

14:42 Go not up, 5927-4 for the LORD 3068 [is] not among 7130 you; that ye be not smitten 5062-11 before 6440 your enemies. 341-6

14:43 For the Amalekites 6003 and the Canaanites 3669 [are] there before 6440 you, and ye shall fall 5307-1 by the sword: 2719 because ye are turned away 7725-1 from 310 the LORD, 3068 therefore the LORD 3068 will not be with you.

14:44 But they presumed 6075-55 to go up 5927-2 unto the hill 2022 top: 7218 nevertheless the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD, 3068 and Moses, 4872 departed 4185-1 not out 7130 of the camp. 4264

14:45 Then the Amalekites 6003 came down, 3381-4 and the Canaanites 3669 which dwelt 3427-6 in that hill, 2022 and smote 5221-55 them, and discomfited 3807-55 them, [even] unto Hormah. 2767

15:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

15:2 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, When ye be come 935-4 into the land 776 of your habitations, 4186 which I give 5414-6 unto you,

15:3 And will make 6213-1 an offering by fire 801 unto the LORD, 3068 a burnt offering, 5930 or a sacrifice 2077 in performing 6381-15 a vow, 5088 or in a freewill offering, 5071 or in your solemn feasts, 4150 to make 6213-2 a sweet 5207 savour 7381 unto the LORD, 3068 of the herd, 1241 or of the flock: 6629

15:4 Then shall he that offereth 7126-56 his offering 7133 unto the LORD 3068 bring 7126-52 a meat offering 4503 of a tenth deal 6241 of flour 5560 mingled 1101-7 with the fourth 7243 [part] of an hin 1969 of oil. 8081

15:5 And the fourth 7243 [part] of an hin 1969 of wine 3196 for a drink offering 5262 shalt thou prepare 6213-4 with the burnt offering 5930 or sacrifice, 2077 for one 259 lamb. 3532

15:6 Or for a ram, 352 thou shalt prepare 6213-4 [for] a meat offering 4503 two 8147 tenth deals 6241 of flour 5560 mingled 1101-7 with the third 7992 [part] of an hin 1969 of oil. 8081

15:7 And for a drink offering 5262 thou shalt offer 7126-55 the third 7992 [part] of an hin 1969 of wine, 3196 [for] a sweet 5207 savour 7381 unto the LORD. 3068

15:8 And when thou preparest 6213-4 a bullock 1121 1241 [for] a burnt offering, 5930 or [for] a sacrifice 2077 in performing 6381-15 a vow, 5088 or peace offerings 8002 unto the LORD: 3068

15:9 Then shall he bring 7126-52 with a bullock 1241 1121 a meat offering 4503 of three 7969 tenth deals 6241 of flour 5560 mingled 1101-7 with half 2677 an hin 1969 of oil. 8081

15:10 And thou shalt bring 7126-55 for a drink offering 5262 half 2677 an hin 1969 of wine, 3196 [for] an offering made by fire, 801 of a sweet 5207 savour 7381 unto the LORD. 3068

15:11 Thus shall it be done 6213-11 for one 259 bullock, 7794 or for one 259 ram, 352 or for a lamb, 3532 7716 or a kid. 5795

15:12 According to the number 4557 that ye shall prepare, 6213-4 so 3602 shall ye do 6213-4 to every one 259 according to their number. 4557

15:13 All that are born of the country 249 shall do 6213-4 these things after this manner, in offering 7126-53 an offering made by fire, 801 of a sweet 5207 savour 7381 unto the LORD. 3068

15:14 And if a stranger 1616 sojourn 1481-4 with you, or whosoever [be] among 8432 you in your generations, 1755 and will offer 6213-1 an offering made by fire, 801 of a sweet 5207 savour 7381 unto the LORD; 3068 as ye do, 6213-4 so he shall do. 6213-4

15:15 One 259 ordinance 2708 [shall be both] for you of the congregation, 6951 and also for the stranger 1616 that sojourneth 1481-6 [with you], an ordinance 2708 for ever 5769 in your generations: 1755 as ye [are], so shall the stranger 1616 be before 6440 the LORD. 3068

15:16 One 259 law 8451 and one 259 manner 4941 shall be for you, and for the stranger 1616 that sojourneth 1481-6 with you.

15:17 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

15:18 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, When ye come 935-2 into the land 776 whither I bring 935-56 you,

15:19 Then it shall be, that, when ye eat 398-2 of the bread 3899 of the land, 776 ye shall offer up 7311-55 an heave offering 8641 unto the LORD. 3068

15:20 Ye shall offer up 7311-55 a cake 2471 of the first 7225 of your dough 6182 [for] an heave offering: 8641 as [ye do] the heave offering 8641 of the threshingfloor, 1637 so shall ye heave 7311-55 it.

15:21 Of the first 7225 of your dough 6182 ye shall give 5414-4 unto the LORD 3068 an heave offering 8641 in your generations. 1755

15:22 And if ye have erred, 7686-4 and not observed 6213-4 all these commandments, 4687 which the LORD 3068 hath spoken 1696-14 unto Moses, 4872

15:23 [Even] all that the LORD 3068 hath commanded 6680-14 you by the hand 3027 of Moses, 4872 from the day 3117 that the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 [Moses], and henceforward 1973 among your generations; 1755

15:24 Then it shall be, if [ought] be committed 6213-8 by ignorance 7684 without the knowledge 5869 of the congregation, 5712 that all the congregation 5712 shall offer 6213-1 one 259 young 6499 1121 bullock 1241 for a burnt offering, 5930 for a sweet 5207 savour 7381 unto the LORD, 3068 with his meat offering, 4503 and his drink offering, 5262 according to the manner, 4941 and one 259 kid 8163 of the goats 5795 for a sin offering. 2403

15:25 And the priest 3548 shall make an atonement 3722-14 for all the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and it shall be forgiven 5545-8 them; for it [is] ignorance: 7684 and they shall bring 935-52 their offering, 7133 a sacrifice made by fire 801 unto the LORD, 3068 and their sin offering 2403 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 for their ignorance: 7684

15:26 And it shall be forgiven 5545-8 all the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and the stranger 1616 that sojourneth 1481-6 among 8432 them; seeing all the people 5971 [were] in ignorance. 7684

15:27 And if any 259 soul 5315 sin 2398-4 through ignorance, 7684 then he shall bring 7126-52 a she goat 5795 of the first 1323 year 8141 for a sin offering. 2403

15:28 And the priest 3548 shall make an atonement 3722-14 for the soul 5315 that sinneth ignorantly, 7683-6 when he sinneth 2398-2 by ignorance 7684 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 to make an atonement 3722-15 for him; and it shall be forgiven 5545-8 him.

15:29 Ye shall have one 259 law 8451 for him that sinneth 6213-6 through ignorance, 7684 [both for] him that is born 249 among the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and for the stranger 1616 that sojourneth 1481-6 among 8432 them.

15:30 But the soul 5315 that doeth 6213-4 [ought] presumptuously, 7311-6 3027 [whether he be] born in the land, 4480 249 or 4480 a stranger, 1616 the same reproacheth 1442-18 the LORD; 3068 and that soul 5315 shall be cut off 3772-8 from among 7130 his people. 5971

15:31 Because he hath despised 959-1 the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 and hath broken 6565-52 his commandment, 4687 that soul 5315 shall utterly 3772-9 be cut off; 3772-11 his iniquity 5771 [shall be] upon him.

15:32 And while the children 1121 of Israel 3478 were in the wilderness, 4057 they found 4672-4 a man 376 that gathered 7197-26 sticks 6086 upon the sabbath 7676 day. 3117

15:33 And they that found 4672-6 him gathering 7197-26 sticks 6086 brought 7126-55 him unto Moses 4872 and Aaron, 175 and unto all the congregation. 5712

15:34 And they put 3240-55 him in ward, 4929 because it was not declared 6567-27 what should be done 6213-11 to him.

15:35 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 The man 376 shall be surely 4191-2 put to death: 4191-93 all the congregation 5712 shall stone 7275-2 him with stones 68 without 2351 the camp. 4264

15:36 And all the congregation 5712 brought 3318-55 him without 2351 the camp, 4264 and stoned 7275-4 him with stones, 68 and he died; 4191-4 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

15:37 And the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

15:38 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and bid 559-1 them that they make 6213-1 them fringes 6734 in the borders 3671 of their garments 899 throughout their generations, 1755 and that they put 5414-1 upon the fringe 6734 of the borders 3671 a ribband 6616 of blue: 8504

15:39 And it shall be unto you for a fringe, 6734 that ye may look 7200-1 upon it, and remember 2142-1 all the commandments 4687 of the LORD, 3068 and do 6213-1 them; and that ye seek 8446-4 not after 310 your own heart 3824 and your own eyes, 5869 after 310 which ye use to go a whoring: 2181-6

15:40 That ye may remember, 2142-4 and do 6213-1 all my commandments, 4687 and be 1961-1 holy 6918 unto your God. 430

15:41 I [am] the LORD 3068 your God, 430 which brought you out 3318-52 of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 to be your God: 430 I [am] the LORD 3068 your God. 430

16:1 Now Korah, 7141 the son 1121 of Izhar, 3324 the son 1121 of Kohath, 6955 the son 1121 of Levi, 3878 and Dathan 1885 and Abiram, 48 the sons 1121 of Eliab, 446 and On, 203 the son 1121 of Peleth, 6431 sons 1121 of Reuben, 7205 took 3947-4 [men]:

16:2 And they rose up 6965-4 before 6440 Moses, 4872 with certain 582 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 two hundred 3967 and fifty 2572 princes 5387 of the assembly, 5712 famous 7148 in the congregation, 4150 men 582 of renown: 8034

16:3 And they gathered themselves together 6950-11 against Moses 4872 and against Aaron, 175 and said 559-4 unto them, [Ye take] too much 7227 upon you, seeing all the congregation 5712 [are] holy, 6918 every one of them, and the LORD 3068 [is] among 8432 them: wherefore then lift ye up 5375-101 yourselves above the congregation 6951 of the LORD? 3068

16:4 And when Moses 4872 heard 8085-4 [it], he fell 5307-4 upon his face: 6440

16:5 And he spake 1696-17 unto Korah 7141 and unto all his company, 5712 saying, 559-2 Even to morrow 1242 the LORD 3068 will shew 3045-55 who [are] his, and [who is] holy; 6918 and will cause [him] to come near 7126-52 unto him: even [him] whom he hath chosen 977-4 will he cause to come near 7126-55 unto him.

16:6 This do; 6213-3 Take 3947-3 you censers, 4289 Korah, 7141 and all his company; 5712

16:7 And put 5414-3 fire 784 therein, 2004 and put 7760-3 incense 7004 in them before 6440 the LORD 3068 to morrow: 4279 and it shall be [that] the man 376 whom the LORD 3068 doth choose, 977-4 he [shall be] holy: 6918 [ye take] too much 7227 upon you, ye sons 1121 of Levi. 3878

16:8 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto Korah, 7141 Hear, 8085-3 I pray you, ye sons 1121 of Levi: 3878

16:9 [Seemeth it but] a small thing 4592 unto you, that the God 430 of Israel 3478 hath separated 914-52 you from the congregation 5712 of Israel, 3478 to bring you near 7126-53 to himself to do 5647-2 the service 5656 of the tabernacle 4908 of the LORD, 3068 and to stand 5975-2 before 6440 the congregation 5712 to minister 8334-15 unto them?

16:10 And he hath brought thee near 7126-55 [to him], and all thy brethren 251 the sons 1121 of Levi 3878 with thee: and seek 1245-14 ye the priesthood 3550 also?

16:11 For which cause 3651 [both] thou and all thy company 5712 [are] gathered together 3259-12 against the LORD: 3068 and what [is] Aaron, 175 that ye murmur 3885-55|3885-11 against him?

16:12 And Moses 4872 sent 7971-4 to call 7121-2 Dathan 1885 and Abiram, 48 the sons 1121 of Eliab: 446 which said, 559-4 We will not come up: 5927-4

16:13 [Is it] a small thing 4592 that thou hast brought us up 5927-52 out of a land 776 that floweth 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey, 1706 to kill 4191-53 us in the wilderness, 4057 except 3588 thou make thyself altogether 8323-99 a prince 8323-101 over us?

16:14 Moreover 637 thou hast not brought 935-52 us into a land 776 that floweth 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey, 1706 or given 5414-4 us inheritance 5159 of fields 7704 and vineyards: 3754 wilt thou put out 5365-17 the eyes 5869 of these men? 582 we will not come up. 5927-4

16:15 And Moses 4872 was very 3966 wroth, 2734-4 and said 559-4 unto the LORD, 3068 Respect 6437-4 not thou their offering: 4503 I have not taken 5375-1 one 259 ass 2543 from them, neither have I hurt 7489-52 one 259 of them.

16:16 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto Korah, 7141 Be thou and all thy company 5712 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 thou, and they, and Aaron, 175 to morrow: 4279

16:17 And take 3947-3 every man 376 his censer, 4289 and put 5414-1 incense 7004 in them, and bring 7126-52 ye before 6440 the LORD 3068 every man 376 his censer, 4289 two hundred 3967 and fifty 2572 censers; 4289 thou also, and Aaron, 175 each 376 [of you] his censer. 4289

16:18 And they took 3947-4 every man 376 his censer, 4289 and put 5414-4 fire 784 in them, and laid 7760-4 incense 7004 thereon, and stood 5975-4 in the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation 4150 with Moses 4872 and Aaron. 175

16:19 And Korah 7141 gathered 6950-55 all the congregation 5712 against them unto the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation: 4150 and the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 appeared 7200-11 unto all the congregation. 5712

16:20 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses 4872 and unto Aaron, 175 saying, 559-2

16:21 Separate 914-10 yourselves from among 8432 this congregation, 5712 that I may consume 3615-17 them in a moment. 7281

16:22 And they fell 5307-4 upon their faces, 6440 and said, 559-4 O God, 410 the God 430 of the spirits 7307 of all flesh, 1320 shall one 259 man 376 sin, 2398-4 and wilt thou be wroth 7107-4 with all the congregation? 5712

16:23 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

16:24 Speak 1696-16 unto the congregation, 5712 saying, 559-2 Get you up 5927-10 from about 5439 the tabernacle 4908 of Korah, 7141 Dathan, 1885 and Abiram. 48

16:25 And Moses 4872 rose up 6965-4 and went 3212-4 unto Dathan 1885 and Abiram; 48 and the elders 2205 of Israel 3478 followed 3212-4 310 him.

16:26 And he spake 1696-17 unto the congregation, 5712 saying, 559-2 Depart, 5493-3 I pray you, from the tents 168 of these wicked 7563 men, 582 and touch 5060-4 nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed 5595-11 in all their sins. 2403

16:27 So they gat up 5927-11 from the tabernacle 4908 of Korah, 7141 Dathan, 1885 and Abiram, 48 on every side: 5439 and Dathan 1885 and Abiram 48 came out, 3318-1 and stood 5324-12 in the door 6607 of their tents, 168 and their wives, 802 and their sons, 1121 and their little children. 2945

16:28 And Moses 4872 said, 559-4 Hereby ye shall know 3045-4 that the LORD 3068 hath sent 7971-1 me to do 6213-2 all these works; 4639 for [I have] not [done them] of mine own mind. 3820

16:29 If these men die 4191-4 the common death 4194 of all men, 120 or if they be visited 6485-11 after the visitation 6486 of all men; 120 [then] the LORD 3068 hath not sent 7971-1 me.

16:30 But if the LORD 3068 make 1254-4 a new thing, 1278 and the earth 127 open 6475-1 her mouth, 6310 and swallow them up, 1104-1 with all that [appertain] unto them, and they go down 3381-1 quick 2416 into the pit; 7585 then ye shall understand 3045-1 that these men 582 have provoked 5006-14 the LORD. 3068

16:31 And it came to pass, as he had made an end 3615-15 of speaking 1696-15 all these words, 1697 that the ground 127 clave asunder 1234-11 that [was] under them:

16:32 And the earth 776 opened 6605-4 her mouth, 6310 and swallowed them up, 1104-4 and their houses, 1004 and all the men 120 that [appertained] unto Korah, 7141 and all [their] goods. 7399

16:33 They, and all that [appertained] to them, went down 3381-4 alive 2416 into the pit, 7585 and the earth 776 closed 3680-17 upon them: and they perished 6-4 from among 8432 the congregation. 6951

16:34 And all Israel 3478 that [were] round about 5439 them fled 5127-1 at the cry 6963 of them: for they said, 559-1 Lest the earth 776 swallow us up 1104-4 [also].

16:35 And there came out 3318-1 a fire 784 from the LORD, 3068 and consumed 398-4 the two hundred 3967 and fifty 2572 men 376 that offered 7126-56 incense. 7004

16:36 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

16:37 Speak 559-3 unto Eleazar 499 the son 1121 of Aaron 175 the priest, 3548 that he take up 7311-55 the censers 4289 out 996 of the burning, 8316 and scatter 2219-3 thou the fire 784 yonder; 1973 for they are hallowed. 6942-1

16:38 The censers 4289 of these sinners 2400 against their own souls, 5315 let them make 6213-1 them broad 7555 plates 6341 [for] a covering 6826 of the altar: 4196 for they offered 7126-52 them before 6440 the LORD, 3068 therefore they are hallowed: 6942-4 and they shall be a sign 226 unto the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

16:39 And Eleazar 499 the priest 3548 took 3947-4 the brasen 5178 censers, 4289 wherewith they that were burnt 8313-7 had offered; 7126-52 and they were made broad 7554-17 [plates for] a covering 6826 of the altar: 4196

16:40 [To be] a memorial 2146 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 that 834 4616 no stranger, 376 2114-5 which [is] not of the seed 2233 of Aaron, 175 come near 7126-4 to offer 6999-53 incense 7004 before 6440 the LORD; 3068 that he be not as Korah, 7141 and as his company: 5712 as the LORD 3068 said 1696-14 to him by the hand 3027 of Moses. 4872

16:41 But on the morrow 4283 all the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 murmured 3885-11 against Moses 4872 and against Aaron, 175 saying, 559-2 Ye have killed 4191-52 the people 5971 of the LORD. 3068

16:42 And it came to pass, when the congregation 5712 was gathered 6950-9 against Moses 4872 and against Aaron, 175 that they looked 6437-4 toward the tabernacle 168 of the congregation: 4150 and, behold, the cloud 6051 covered 3680-14 it, and the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 appeared. 7200-11

16:43 And Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 came 935-4 before 6440 the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150

16:44 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

16:45 Get you up 7426-10 from among 8432 this congregation, 5712 that I may consume 3615-17 them as in a moment. 7281 And they fell 5307-4 upon their faces. 6440

16:46 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto Aaron, 175 Take 3947-3 a censer, 4289 and put 5414-3 fire 784 therein from off the altar, 4196 and put 7760-3 on incense, 7004 and go 3212-54 quickly 4120 unto the congregation, 5712 and make an atonement 3722-16 for them: for there is wrath 7110 gone out 3318-1 from 6440 the LORD; 3068 the plague 5063 is begun. 2490-52

16:47 And Aaron 175 took 3947-4 as Moses 4872 commanded, 1696-14 and ran 7323-4 into the midst 8432 of the congregation; 6951 and, behold, the plague 5063 was begun 2490-52 among the people: 5971 and he put 5414-4 on incense, 7004 and made an atonement 3722-17 for the people. 5971

16:48 And he stood 5975-4 between the dead 4191-5 and the living; 2416 and the plague 4046 was stayed. 6113-11

16:49 Now they that died 4191-5 in the plague 4046 were fourteen 702 6240 thousand 505 and seven 7651 hundred, 3967 beside them that died 4191-5 about the matter 1697 of Korah. 7141

16:50 And Aaron 175 returned 7725-4 unto Moses 4872 unto the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation: 4150 and the plague 4046 was stayed. 6113-8

17:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

17:2 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and take 3947-3 of every one of them a rod 4294 4294 according to the house 1004 of [their] fathers, 1 of all their princes 5387 according to the house 1004 of their fathers 1 twelve 8147 6240 rods: 4294 write 3789-4 thou every man's 376 name 8034 upon his rod. 4294

17:3 And thou shalt write 3789-4 Aaron's 175 name 8034 upon the rod 4294 of Levi: 3878 for one 259 rod 4294 [shall be] for the head 7218 of the house 1004 of their fathers. 1

17:4 And thou shalt lay them up 3240-52 in the tabernacle 168 of the congregation 4150 before 6440 the testimony, 5715 where I will meet 3259-11 with you.

17:5 And it shall come to pass, [that] the man's 376 rod, 4294 whom I shall choose, 977-4 shall blossom: 6524-4 and I will make to cease 7918-52 from me the murmurings 8519 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 whereby they murmur 3885-56 against you.

17:6 And Moses 4872 spake 1696-17 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and every one of their princes 5387 gave 5414-4 him a rod 4294 4294 apiece, 5387 259 for each prince 5387 one, 259 according to their fathers' 1 houses, 1004 [even] twelve 6240 8147 rods: 4294 and the rod 4294 of Aaron 175 [was] among 8432 their rods. 4294

17:7 And Moses 4872 laid up 3240-55 the rods 4294 before 6440 the LORD 3068 in the tabernacle 168 of witness. 5715

17:8 And it came to pass, that on the morrow 4283 Moses 4872 went 935-4 into the tabernacle 168 of witness; 5715 and, behold, the rod 4294 of Aaron 175 for the house 1004 of Levi 3878 was budded, 6524-1 and brought forth 3318-55 buds, 6525 and bloomed 6692-55 blossoms, 6731 and yielded 1580-4 almonds. 8247

17:9 And Moses 4872 brought out 3318-55 all the rods 4294 from before 6440 the LORD 3068 unto all the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 and they looked, 7200-4 and took 3947-4 every man 376 his rod. 4294

17:10 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Bring Aaron's 175 rod 4294 again 7725-54 before 6440 the testimony, 5715 to be kept 4931 for a token 226 against the rebels; 4805 1121 and thou shalt quite take away 3615-17 their murmurings 8519 from me, that they die 4191-4 not.

17:11 And Moses 4872 did 6213-4 [so]: as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 him, so did 6213-1 he.

17:12 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 spake 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2 Behold, we die, 1478-1 we perish, 6-1 we all perish. 6-1

17:13 Whosoever cometh any thing near 7131 unto the tabernacle 4908 of the LORD 3068 shall die: 4191-4 shall we be consumed 8552-1 with dying? 1478-2

18:1 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Aaron, 175 Thou and thy sons 1121 and thy father's 1 house 1004 with thee shall bear 5375-4 the iniquity 5771 of the sanctuary: 4720 and thou and thy sons 1121 with thee shall bear 5375-4 the iniquity 5771 of your priesthood. 3550

18:2 And thy brethren 251 also of the tribe 4294 of Levi, 3878 the tribe 7626 of thy father, 1 bring 7126-54 thou with thee, that they may be joined 3867-11 unto thee, and minister 8334-17 unto thee: but thou and thy sons 1121 with thee [shall minister] before 6440 the tabernacle 168 of witness. 5715

18:3 And they shall keep 8104-1 thy charge, 4931 and the charge 4931 of all the tabernacle: 168 only they shall not come nigh 7126-4 the vessels 3627 of the sanctuary 6944 and the altar, 4196 that neither they, nor ye also, die. 4191-4

18:4 And they shall be joined 3867-8 unto thee, and keep 8104-1 the charge 4931 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 for all the service 5656 of the tabernacle: 168 and a stranger 2114-5 shall not come nigh 7126-4 unto you.

18:5 And ye shall keep 8104-1 the charge 4931 of the sanctuary, 6944 and the charge 4931 of the altar: 4196 that there be no wrath 7110 any more upon the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

18:6 And I, behold, I have taken 3947-1 your brethren 251 the Levites 3881 from among 8432 the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 to you [they are] given 5414-7 [as] a gift 4979 for the LORD, 3068 to do 5647-2 the service 5656 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150

18:7 Therefore thou and thy sons 1121 with thee shall keep 8104-4 your priest's office 3550 for every thing 1697 of the altar, 4196 and within 1004 the vail; 6532 and ye shall serve: 5647-1 I have given 5414-4 your priest's office 3550 [unto you] as a service 5656 of gift: 4979 and the stranger 2114-5 that cometh nigh 7131 shall be put to death. 4191-93

18:8 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Aaron, 175 Behold, I also have given 5414-1 thee the charge 4931 of mine heave offerings 8641 of all the hallowed things 6944 of the children 1121 of Israel; 3478 unto thee have I given 5414-1 them by reason of the anointing, 4888 and to thy sons, 1121 by an ordinance 2706 for ever. 5769

18:9 This shall be thine of the most 6944 holy things, 6944 [reserved] from the fire: 784 every oblation 7133 of theirs, every meat offering 4503 of theirs, and every sin offering 2403 of theirs, and every trespass offering 817 of theirs, which they shall render 7725-55 unto me, [shall be] most 6944 holy 6944 for thee and for thy sons. 1121

18:10 In the most 6944 holy 6944 [place] shalt thou eat 398-4 it; every male 2145 shall eat 398-4 it: it shall be holy 6944 unto thee.

18:11 And this [is] thine; the heave offering 8641 of their gift, 4976 with all the wave offerings 8573 of the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 I have given 5414-1 them unto thee, and to thy sons 1121 and to thy daughters 1323 with thee, by a statute 2706 for ever: 5769 every one that is clean 2889 in thy house 1004 shall eat 398-4 of it.

18:12 All the best 2459 of the oil, 3323 and all the best 2459 of the wine, 8492 and of the wheat, 1715 the firstfruits 7225 of them which they shall offer 5414-4 unto the LORD, 3068 them have I given 5414-1 thee.

18:13 [And] whatsoever is first ripe 1061 in the land, 776 which they shall bring 935-55 unto the LORD, 3068 shall be thine; every one that is clean 2889 in thine house 1004 shall eat 398-4 [of] it.

18:14 Every thing devoted 2764 in Israel 3478 shall be thine.

18:15 Every thing that openeth 6363 the matrix 7358 in all flesh, 1320 which they bring 7126-55 unto the LORD, 3068 [whether it be] of men 120 or beasts, 929 shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn 1060 of man 120 shalt thou surely 6299-2 redeem, 6299-4 and the firstling 1060 of unclean 2931 beasts 929 shalt thou redeem. 6299-4

18:16 And those that are to be redeemed 6299-7 from a month 2320 old 1121 shalt thou redeem, 6299-4 according to thine estimation, 6187 for the money 3701 of five 2568 shekels, 8255 after the shekel 8255 of the sanctuary, 6944 which [is] twenty 6242 gerahs. 1626

18:17 But the firstling 1060 of a cow, 7794 or the firstling 1060 of a sheep, 3775 or the firstling 1060 of a goat, 5795 thou shalt not redeem; 6299-4 they [are] holy: 6944 thou shalt sprinkle 2236-4 their blood 1818 upon the altar, 4196 and shalt burn 6999-55 their fat 2459 [for] an offering made by fire, 801 for a sweet 5207 savour 7381 unto the LORD. 3068

18:18 And the flesh 1320 of them shall be thine, as the wave 8573 breast 2373 and as the right 3225 shoulder 7785 are thine.

18:19 All the heave offerings 8641 of the holy things, 6944 which the children 1121 of Israel 3478 offer 7311-55 unto the LORD, 3068 have I given 5414-1 thee, and thy sons 1121 and thy daughters 1323 with thee, by a statute 2706 for ever: 5769 it [is] a covenant 1285 of salt 4417 for ever 5769 before 6440 the LORD 3068 unto thee and to thy seed 2233 with thee.

18:20 And the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto Aaron, 175 Thou shalt have no inheritance 5157-4 in their land, 776 neither shalt thou have any part 2506 among 8432 them: I [am] thy part 2506 and thine inheritance 5159 among 8432 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

18:21 And, behold, I have given 5414-1 the children 1121 of Levi 3878 all the tenth 4643 in Israel 3478 for an inheritance, 5159 for 2500 their service 5656 which they serve, 5647-6 [even] the service 5656 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150

18:22 Neither must the children 1121 of Israel 3478 henceforth 5750 come nigh 7126-4 the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 lest they bear 5375-2 sin, 2399 and die. 4191-2

18:23 But the Levites 3881 shall do 5647-1 the service 5656 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and they shall bear 5375-4 their iniquity: 5771 [it shall be] a statute 2708 for ever 5769 throughout your generations, 1755 that among 8432 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 they have 5157-4 no inheritance. 5159

18:24 But the tithes 4643 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 which they offer 7311-55 [as] an heave offering 8641 unto the LORD, 3068 I have given 5414-1 to the Levites 3881 to inherit: 5159 therefore I have said 559-1 unto them, Among 8432 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 they shall have 5157-4 no inheritance. 5159

18:25 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

18:26 Thus speak 1696-17 unto the Levites, 3881 and say 559-1 unto them, When ye take 3947-4 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 the tithes 4643 which I have given 5414-1 you from them for your inheritance, 5159 then ye shall offer up 7311-52 an heave offering 8641 of it for the LORD, 3068 [even] a tenth 4643 [part] of the tithe. 4643

18:27 And [this] your heave offering 8641 shall be reckoned 2803-8 unto you, as though [it were] the corn 1715 of the threshingfloor, 1637 and as the fulness 4395 of the winepress. 3342

18:28 Thus ye also shall offer 7311-55 an heave offering 8641 unto the LORD 3068 of all your tithes, 4643 which ye receive 3947-4 of the children 1121 of Israel; 3478 and ye shall give 5414-1 thereof the LORD'S 3068 heave offering 8641 to Aaron 175 the priest. 3548

18:29 Out of all your gifts 4979 ye shall offer 7311-55 every heave offering 8641 of the LORD, 3068 of all the best 2459 thereof, [even] the hallowed part 4720 thereof out of it.

18:30 Therefore thou shalt say 559-1 unto them, When ye have heaved 7311-53 the best 2459 thereof from it, then it shall be counted 2803-8 unto the Levites 3881 as the increase 8393 of the threshingfloor, 1637 and as the increase 8393 of the winepress. 3342

18:31 And ye shall eat 398-1 it in every place, 4725 ye and your households: 1004 for it [is] your reward 7939 for 2500 your service 5656 in the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150

18:32 And ye shall bear 5375-4 no sin 2399 by reason of it, when ye have heaved 7311-53 from it the best 2459 of it: neither shall ye pollute 2490-17 the holy things 6944 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 lest ye die. 4191-4

19:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses 4872 and unto Aaron, 175 saying, 559-2

19:2 This [is] the ordinance 2708 of the law 8451 which the LORD 3068 hath commanded, 6680-14 saying, 559-2 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 that they bring 3947-4 thee a red 122 heifer 6510 without spot, 8549 wherein [is] no blemish, 3971 [and] upon which never 3808 came 5927-1 yoke: 5923

19:3 And ye shall give 5414-1 her unto Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 that he may bring her forth 3318-52 without 2351 the camp, 4264 and [one] shall slay 7819-1 her before 6440 his face:

19:4 And Eleazar 499 the priest 3548 shall take 3947-1 of her blood 1818 with his finger, 676 and sprinkle 5137-52 of her blood 1818 directly 5227 before 6440 the tabernacle 168 of the congregation 4150 seven 7651 times: 6471

19:5 And [one] shall burn 8313-1 the heifer 6510 in his sight; 5869 her skin, 5785 and her flesh, 1320 and her blood, 1818 with her dung, 6569 shall he burn: 8313-4

19:6 And the priest 3548 shall take 3947-1 cedar 730 wood, 6086 and hyssop, 231 and scarlet, 8438 8144 and cast 7993-52 [it] into the midst 8432 of the burning 8316 of the heifer. 6510

19:7 Then the priest 3548 shall wash 3526-14 his clothes, 899 and he shall bathe 7364-1 his flesh 1320 in water, 4325 and afterward 310 he shall come 935-4 into the camp, 4264 and the priest 3548 shall be unclean 2930-1 until the even. 6153

19:8 And he that burneth 8313-6 her shall wash 3526-17 his clothes 899 in water, 4325 and bathe 7364-1 his flesh 1320 in water, 4325 and shall be unclean 2930-1 until the even. 6153

19:9 And a man 376 [that is] clean 2889 shall gather 622-1 up the ashes 665 of the heifer, 6510 and lay [them] up 3240-52 without 2351 the camp 4264 in a clean 2889 place, 4725 and it shall be kept 4931 for the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 for a water 4325 of separation: 5079 it [is] a purification for sin. 2403

19:10 And he that gathereth 622-6 the ashes 665 of the heifer 6510 shall wash 3526-14 his clothes, 899 and be unclean 2930-1 until the even: 6153 and it shall be unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and unto the stranger 1616 that sojourneth 1481-6 among 8432 them, for a statute 2708 for ever. 5769

19:11 He that toucheth 5060-6 the dead 4191-5 body 5315 of any man 120 shall be unclean 2930-1 seven 7651 days. 3117

19:12 He shall purify 2398-101 himself with it on the third 7992 day, 3117 and on the seventh 7637 day 3117 he shall be clean: 2891-4 but if he purify 2398-101 not himself the third 7992 day, 3117 then the seventh 7637 day 3117 he shall not be clean. 2891-4

19:13 Whosoever toucheth 5060-6 the dead 4191-5 body 5315 of any man 120 that is dead, 4191-4 and purifieth 2398-101 not himself, defileth 2930-14 the tabernacle 4908 of the LORD; 3068 and that soul 5315 shall be cut off 3772-8 from Israel: 3478 because the water 4325 of separation 5079 was not sprinkled 2236-27 upon him, he shall be unclean; 2931 his uncleanness 2932 [is] yet upon him.

19:14 This [is] the law, 8451 when a man 120 dieth 4191-4 in a tent: 168 all that come 935-6 into the tent, 168 and all that [is] in the tent, 168 shall be unclean 2930-4 seven 7651 days. 3117

19:15 And every open 6605-7 vessel, 3627 which hath no covering 6781 bound 6616 upon it, [is] unclean. 2931

19:16 And whosoever toucheth 5060-4 one that is slain 2491 with a sword 2719 in the open 6440 fields, 7704 or a dead 4191-5 body, or a bone 6106 of a man, 120 or a grave, 6913 shall be unclean 2930-4 seven 7651 days. 3117

19:17 And for an unclean 2931 [person] they shall take 3947-1 of the ashes 6083 of the burnt 8316 heifer of purification for sin, 2403 and running 2416 water 4325 shall be put 5414-1 thereto in a vessel: 3627

19:18 And a clean 2889 person 376 shall take 3947-1 hyssop, 231 and dip 2881-1 [it] in the water, 4325 and sprinkle 5137-52 [it] upon the tent, 168 and upon all the vessels, 3627 and upon the persons 5315 that were there, and upon him that touched 5060-6 a bone, 6106 or one slain, 2491 or one dead, 4191-5 or a grave: 6913

19:19 And the clean 2889 [person] shall sprinkle 5137-52 upon the unclean 2931 on the third 7992 day, 3117 and on the seventh 7637 day: 3117 and on the seventh 7637 day 3117 he shall purify 2398-14 himself, and wash 3526-14 his clothes, 899 and bathe 7364-1 himself in water, 4325 and shall be clean 2891-1 at even. 6153

19:20 But the man 376 that shall be unclean, 2930-4 and shall not purify 2398-101 himself, that soul 5315 shall be cut off 3772-8 from among 8432 the congregation, 6951 because he hath defiled 2930-14 the sanctuary 4720 of the LORD: 3068 the water 4325 of separation 5079 hath not been sprinkled 2236-27 upon him; he [is] unclean. 2931

19:21 And it shall be a perpetual 5769 statute 2708 unto them, that he that sprinkleth 5137-56 the water 4325 of separation 5079 shall wash 3526-17 his clothes; 899 and he that toucheth 5060-6 the water 4325 of separation 5079 shall be unclean 2930-4 until even. 6153

19:22 And whatsoever the unclean 2931 [person] toucheth 5060-4 shall be unclean; 2930-4 and the soul 5315 that toucheth 5060-6 [it] shall be unclean 2930-4 until even. 6153

20:1 Then came 935-4 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 [even] the whole congregation, 5712 into the desert 4057 of Zin 6790 in the first 7223 month: 2320 and the people 5971 abode 3427-4 in Kadesh; 6946 and Miriam 4813 died 4191-4 there, and was buried 6912-11 there.

20:2 And there was no water 4325 for the congregation: 5712 and they gathered themselves together 6950-11 against Moses 4872 and against Aaron. 175

20:3 And the people 5971 chode 7378-4 with Moses, 4872 and spake, 559-4 saying, 559-2 Would God that 3863 we had died 1478-1 when our brethren 251 died 1478-2 before 6440 the LORD! 3068

20:4 And why have ye brought 935-52 up the congregation 6951 of the LORD 3068 into this wilderness, 4057 that we and our cattle 1165 should die 4191-2 there?

20:5 And wherefore have ye made us to come up 5927-52 out of Egypt, 4714 to bring 935-53 us in unto this evil 7451 place? 4725 it [is] no place 4725 of seed, 2233 or of figs, 8384 or of vines, 1612 or of pomegranates; 7416 neither [is] there any water 4325 to drink. 8354-2

20:6 And Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 went 935-4 from the presence 6440 of the assembly 6951 unto the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and they fell 5307-4 upon their faces: 6440 and the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 appeared 7200-11 unto them.

20:7 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

20:8 Take 3947-3 the rod, 4294 and gather thou the assembly 5712 together, 6950-54 thou, and Aaron 175 thy brother, 251 and speak 1696-14 ye unto the rock 5553 before their eyes; 5869 and it shall give forth 5414-1 his water, 4325 and thou shalt bring forth 3318-52 to them water 4325 out of the rock: 5553 so thou shalt give the congregation 5712 and their beasts 1165 drink. 8248-52

20:9 And Moses 4872 took 3947-4 the rod 4294 from before 6440 the LORD, 3068 as he commanded 6680-14 him.

20:10 And Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 gathered the congregation 6951 together 6950-55 before 6440 the rock, 5553 and he said 559-4 unto them, Hear 8085-3 now, ye rebels; 4784-6 must we fetch you water 4325 out 3318-55 of this rock? 5553

20:11 And Moses 4872 lifted up 7311-55 his hand, 3027 and with his rod 4294 he smote 5221-55 the rock 5553 twice: 6471 and the water 4325 came out 3318-4 abundantly, 7227 and the congregation 5712 drank, 8354-4 and their beasts 1165 [also].

20:12 And the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto Moses 4872 and Aaron, 175 Because ye believed 539-52 me not, to sanctify 6942-53 me in the eyes 5869 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 therefore ye shall not bring 935-55 this congregation 6951 into the land 776 which I have given 5414-1 them.

20:13 This 1992 [is] the water 4325 of Meribah; 4809 because the children 1121 of Israel 3478 strove 7378-1 with the LORD, 3068 and he was sanctified 6942-11 in them.

20:14 And Moses 4872 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 from Kadesh 6946 unto the king 4428 of Edom, 123 Thus saith 559-1 thy brother 251 Israel, 3478 Thou knowest 3045-1 all the travail 8513 that hath befallen 4672-1 us:

20:15 How our fathers 1 went down 3381-4 into Egypt, 4714 and we have dwelt 3427-4 in Egypt 4714 a long 7227 time; 3117 and the Egyptians 4714 vexed 7489-55 us, and our fathers: 1

20:16 And when we cried 6817-4 unto the LORD, 3068 he heard 8085-4 our voice, 6963 and sent 7971-4 an angel, 4397 and hath brought us forth 3318-55 out of Egypt: 4714 and, behold, we [are] in Kadesh, 6946 a city 5892 in the uttermost 7097 of thy border: 1366

20:17 Let us pass, 5674-4 I pray thee, through thy country: 776 we will not pass 5674-4 through the fields, 7704 or through the vineyards, 3754 neither will we drink 8354-4 [of] the water 4325 of the wells: 875 we will go 3212-4 by the king's 4428 [high] way, 1870 we will not turn 5186-4 to the right hand 3225 nor to the left, 8040 until we have passed 5674-4 thy borders. 1366

20:18 And Edom 123 said 559-4 unto him, Thou shalt not pass 5674-4 by me, lest I come out 3318-4 against 7125-2 thee with the sword. 2719

20:19 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto him, We will go 5927-4 by the high way: 4546 and if I and my cattle 4735 drink 8354-4 of thy water, 4325 then I will pay 5414-1 4377 for it: I will only, without [doing] any thing 1697 [else], go through 5674-4 on my feet. 7272

20:20 And he said, 559-4 Thou shalt not go through. 5674-4 And Edom 123 came out 3318-4 against 7125-2 him with much 3515 people, 5971 and with a strong 2389 hand. 3027

20:21 Thus Edom 123 refused 3985-17 to give 5414-2 Israel 3478 passage 5674-2 through his border: 1366 wherefore Israel 3478 turned 5186-4 away from him.

20:22 And the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 [even] the whole congregation, 5712 journeyed 5265-4 from Kadesh, 6946 and came 935-4 unto mount 2022 Hor. 2023

20:23 And the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 in mount 2022 Hor, 2023 by the coast 1366 of the land 776 of Edom, 123 saying, 559-2

20:24 Aaron 175 shall be gathered 622-11 unto his people: 5971 for he shall not enter 935-4 into the land 776 which I have given 5414-1 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 because ye rebelled 4784-1 against my word 6310 at the water 4325 of Meribah. 4809

20:25 Take 3947-3 Aaron 175 and Eleazar 499 his son, 1121 and bring them up 5927-54 unto mount 2022 Hor: 2023

20:26 And strip 6584-54 Aaron 175 of his garments, 899 and put 3847-52 them upon Eleazar 499 his son: 1121 and Aaron 175 shall be gathered 622-11 [unto his people], and shall die 4191-1 there.

20:27 And Moses 4872 did 6213-4 as the LORD 3068 commanded: 6680-14 and they went up 5927-4 into mount 2022 Hor 2023 in the sight 5869 of all the congregation. 5712

20:28 And Moses 4872 stripped 6584-55 Aaron 175 of his garments, 899 and put 3847-55 them upon Eleazar 499 his son; 1121 and Aaron 175 died 4191-4 there in the top 7218 of the mount: 2022 and Moses 4872 and Eleazar 499 came down 3381-4 from the mount. 2022

20:29 And when all the congregation 5712 saw 7200-4 that Aaron 175 was dead, 1478-1 they mourned 1058-4 for Aaron 175 thirty 7970 days, 3117 [even] all the house 1004 of Israel. 3478

21:1 And [when] king 4428 Arad 6166 the Canaanite, 3669 which dwelt 3427-6 in the south, 5045 heard 8085-4 tell that Israel 3478 came 935-6 by the way 1870 of the spies; 871 then he fought 3898-11 against Israel, 3478 and took 7617-4 [some] of them prisoners. 7628

21:2 And Israel 3478 vowed 5087-4 a vow 5088 unto the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 If thou wilt indeed 5414-2 deliver 5414-4 this people 5971 into my hand, 3027 then I will utterly destroy 2763-52 their cities. 5892

21:3 And the LORD 3068 hearkened 8085-4 to the voice 6963 of Israel, 3478 and delivered up 5414-4 the Canaanites; 3669 and they utterly destroyed 2763-55 them and their cities: 5892 and he called 7121-4 the name 8034 of the place 4725 Hormah. 2767

21:4 And they journeyed 5265-4 from mount 2022 Hor 2023 by the way 1870 of the Red 5488 sea, 3220 to compass 5437-2 the land 776 of Edom: 123 and the soul 5315 of the people 5971 was much discouraged 7114-4 because of the way. 1870

21:5 And the people 5971 spake 1696-17 against God, 430 and against Moses, 4872 Wherefore have ye brought us up 5927-52 out of Egypt 4714 to die 4191-2 in the wilderness? 4057 for [there is] no bread, 3899 neither [is there any] water; 4325 and our soul 5315 loatheth 6973-1 this light 7052 bread. 3899

21:6 And the LORD 3068 sent 7971-17 fiery 8314 serpents 5175 among the people, 5971 and they bit 5391-17 the people; 5971 and much 7227 people 5971 of Israel 3478 died. 4191-4

21:7 Therefore the people 5971 came 935-4 to Moses, 4872 and said, 559-4 We have sinned, 2398-1 for we have spoken 1696-14 against the LORD, 3068 and against thee; pray 6419-100 unto the LORD, 3068 that he take away 5493-55 the serpents 5175 from us. And Moses 4872 prayed 6419-101 for the people. 5971

21:8 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Make 6213-3 thee a fiery serpent, 8314 and set 7760-3 it upon a pole: 5251 and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, 5391-7 when he looketh 7200-1 upon it, shall live. 2425-1

21:9 And Moses 4872 made 6213-4 a serpent 5175 of brass, 5178 and put 7760-4 it upon a pole, 5251 and it came to pass, that if a serpent 5175 had bitten 5391-1 any man, 376 when he beheld 5027-52 the serpent 5175 of brass, 5178 he lived. 2425-1

21:10 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 set forward, 5265-4 and pitched 2583-4 in Oboth. 88

21:11 And they journeyed 5265-4 from Oboth, 88 and pitched 2583-4 at Ijeabarim, 5863|5856 in the wilderness 4057 which [is] before 6440 Moab, 4124 toward the sunrising. 4217 8121

21:12 From thence they removed, 5265-1 and pitched 2583-4 in the valley 5158 of Zared. 2218

21:13 From thence they removed, 5265-1 and pitched 2583-4 on the other side 5676 of Arnon, 769 which [is] in the wilderness 4057 that cometh out 3318-6 of the coasts 1366 of the Amorites: 567 for Arnon 769 [is] the border 1366 of Moab, 4124 between Moab 4124 and the Amorites. 567

21:14 Wherefore it is said 559-11 in the book 5612 of the wars 4421 of the LORD, 3068 What he did 2052 in the Red sea, 5492 and in the brooks 5158 of Arnon, 769

21:15 And at the stream 793 of the brooks 5158 that goeth down 5186-1 to the dwelling 3427-2 of Ar, 6144 and lieth 8172-8 upon the border 1366 of Moab. 4124

21:16 And from thence [they went] to Beer: 876 that [is] the well 875 whereof the LORD 3068 spake 559-1 unto Moses, 4872 Gather 622-3 the people 5971 together, and I will give 5414-4 them water. 4325

21:17 Then Israel 3478 sang 7891-4 this song, 7892 Spring up, 5927-3 O well; 875 sing 6030-3 ye unto it:

21:18 The princes 8269 digged 2658-1 the well, 875 the nobles 5081 of the people 5971 digged 3738-1 it, by [the direction of] the lawgiver, 2710-26 with their staves. 4938 And from the wilderness 4057 [they went] to Mattanah: 4980

21:19 And from Mattanah 4980 to Nahaliel: 5160 and from Nahaliel 5160 to Bamoth: 1120

21:20 And from Bamoth 1120 [in] the valley, 1516 that [is] in the country 7704 of Moab, 4124 to the top 7218 of Pisgah, 6449 which looketh 8259-8 toward 6440 Jeshimon. 3452

21:21 And Israel 3478 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 unto Sihon 5511 king 4428 of the Amorites, 567 saying, 559-2

21:22 Let me pass 5674-4 through thy land: 776 we will not turn 5186-4 into the fields, 7704 or into the vineyards; 3754 we will not drink 8354-4 [of] the waters 4325 of the well: 875 [but] we will go 3212-4 along by the king's 4428 [high] way, 1870 until we be past 5674-4 thy borders. 1366

21:23 And Sihon 5511 would not suffer 5414-1 Israel 3478 to pass 5674-2 through his border: 1366 but Sihon 5511 gathered 622-4 all his people 5971 together, and went out 3318-4 against 7125-2 Israel 3478 into the wilderness: 4057 and he came 935-4 to Jahaz, 3096 and fought 3898-11 against Israel. 3478

21:24 And Israel 3478 smote 5221-55 him with the edge 6310 of the sword, 2719 and possessed 3423-4 his land 776 from Arnon 769 unto Jabbok, 2999 even unto the children 1121 of Ammon: 5983 for the border 1366 of the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 [was] strong. 5794

21:25 And Israel 3478 took 3947-4 all these cities: 5892 and Israel 3478 dwelt 3427-4 in all the cities 5892 of the Amorites, 567 in Heshbon, 2809 and in all the villages 1323 thereof.

21:26 For Heshbon 2809 [was] the city 5892 of Sihon 5511 the king 4428 of the Amorites, 567 who had fought 3898-8 against the former 7223 king 4428 of Moab, 4124 and taken 3947-4 all his land 776 out of his hand, 3027 even unto Arnon. 769

21:27 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs 4911-6 say, 559-4 Come 935-3 into Heshbon, 2809 let the city 5892 of Sihon 5511 be built 1129-11 and prepared: 3559-113

21:28 For there is a fire 784 gone out 3318-1 of Heshbon, 2809 a flame 3852 from the city 7151 of Sihon: 5511 it hath consumed 398-1 Ar 6144 of Moab, 4124 [and] the lords 1167 of the high places 1116 of Arnon. 769

21:29 Woe 188 to thee, Moab! 4124 thou art undone, 6-1 O people 5971 of Chemosh: 3645 he hath given 5414-1 his sons 1121 that escaped, 6412 and his daughters, 1323 into captivity 7622 unto Sihon 5511 king 4428 of the Amorites. 567

21:30 We have shot 3384-4 at them; Heshbon 2809 is perished 6-1 even unto Dibon, 1769 and we have laid them waste 8074-55 even unto Nophah, 5302 which [reacheth] unto Medeba. 4311

21:31 Thus Israel 3478 dwelt 3427-4 in the land 776 of the Amorites. 567

21:32 And Moses 4872 sent 7971-4 to spy out 7270-15 Jaazer, 3270 and they took 3920-4 the villages 1323 thereof, and drove out 3423-55|3423-4-k the Amorites 567 that [were] there.

21:33 And they turned 6437-4 and went up 5927-4 by the way 1870 of Bashan: 1316 and Og 5747 the king 4428 of Bashan 1316 went out 3318-4 against 7125-2 them, he, and all his people, 5971 to the battle 4421 at Edrei. 154

21:34 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Fear 3372-4 him not: for I have delivered 5414-1 him into thy hand, 3027 and all his people, 5971 and his land; 776 and thou shalt do 6213-1 to him as thou didst 6213-1 unto Sihon 5511 king 4428 of the Amorites, 567 which dwelt 3427-6 at Heshbon. 2809

21:35 So they smote 5221-55 him, and his sons, 1121 and all his people, 5971 until there was none 1115 left 7604-52 him alive: 8300 and they possessed 3423-4 his land. 776

22:1 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 set forward, 5265-4 and pitched 2583-4 in the plains 6160 of Moab 4124 on this side 5676 Jordan 3383 [by] Jericho. 3405

22:2 And Balak 1111 the son 1121 of Zippor 6834 saw 7200-4 all that Israel 3478 had done 6213-1 to the Amorites. 567

22:3 And Moab 4124 was sore 3966 afraid 1481-4 of 6440 the people, 5971 because they [were] many: 7227 and Moab 4124 was distressed 6973-4 because of 6440 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

22:4 And Moab 4124 said 559-4 unto the elders 2205 of Midian, 4080 Now shall this company 6951 lick up 3897-17 all [that are] round about 5439 us, as the ox 7794 licketh up 3897-2 the grass 3418 of the field. 7704 And Balak 1111 the son 1121 of Zippor 6834 [was] king 4428 of the Moabites 4124 at that time. 6256

22:5 He sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 therefore unto Balaam 1109 the son 1121 of Beor 1160 to Pethor, 6604 which [is] by the river 5104 of the land 776 of the children 1121 of his people, 5971 to call 7121-2 him, saying, 559-2 Behold, there is a people 5971 come out 3318-1 from Egypt: 4714 behold, they cover 3680-14 the face 5869 of the earth, 776 and they abide 3427-6 over against 4136 me:

22:6 Come 3212-3 now therefore, I pray thee, curse 779-3 me this people; 5971 for they [are] too mighty 6099 for me: peradventure I shall prevail, 3201-4 [that] we may smite 5221-55 them, and [that] I may drive them out 1644-17 of the land: 776 for I wot 3045-1 that he whom thou blessest 1288-17 [is] blessed, 1288-30 and he whom thou cursest 779-4 is cursed. 779-93

22:7 And the elders 2205 of Moab 4124 and the elders 2205 of Midian 4080 departed 3212-4 with the rewards of divination 7081 in their hand; 3027 and they came 935-4 unto Balaam, 1109 and spake 1696-17 unto him the words 1697 of Balak. 1111

22:8 And he said 559-4 unto them, Lodge 3885-3 here this night, 3915 and I will bring you word 1697 again, 7725-52 as the LORD 3068 shall speak 1696-17 unto me: and the princes 8269 of Moab 4124 abode 3427-4 with Balaam. 1109

22:9 And God 430 came 935-4 unto Balaam, 1109 and said, 559-4 What men 582 [are] these with thee?

22:10 And Balaam 1109 said 559-4 unto God, 430 Balak 1111 the son 1121 of Zippor, 6834 king 4428 of Moab, 4124 hath sent 7971-1 unto me, [saying],

22:11 Behold, [there is] a people 5971 come out 3318-6 of Egypt, 4714 which covereth 3680-17 the face 5869 of the earth: 776 come 3212-3 now, curse 6895-3 me them; peradventure I shall be able 3201-4 to overcome 3898-9 them, and drive them out. 1644-14

22:12 And God 430 said 559-4 unto Balaam, 1109 Thou shalt not go 3212-4 with them; thou shalt not curse 779-4 the people: 5971 for they [are] blessed. 1288-7

22:13 And Balaam 1109 rose up 6965-4 in the morning, 1242 and said 559-4 unto the princes 8269 of Balak, 1111 Get 3212-3 you into your land: 776 for the LORD 3068 refuseth 3985-14 to give me leave 5414-2 to go 1980-2 with you.

22:14 And the princes 8269 of Moab 4124 rose up, 6965-4 and they went 935-4 unto Balak, 1111 and said, 559-4 Balaam 1109 refuseth 3985-14 to come 1980-2 with us.

22:15 And Balak 1111 sent 7971-2 yet again 3254-55 princes, 8269 more, 7227 and more honourable 3513-12 than they.

22:16 And they came 935-4 to Balaam, 1109 and said 559-4 to him, Thus saith 559-1 Balak 1111 the son 1121 of Zippor, 6834 Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder 4513-11 thee from coming 1980-2 unto me:

22:17 For I will promote thee unto very 3966 great 3513-15 honour, 3513-17 and I will do 6213-4 whatsoever thou sayest 559-4 unto me: come 3212-3 therefore, I pray thee, curse 6895-3 me this people. 5971

22:18 And Balaam 1109 answered 6030-4 and said 559-4 unto the servants 5650 of Balak, 1111 If Balak 1111 would give 5414-4 me his house 1004 full 4393 of silver 3701 and gold, 2091 I cannot 3808 3201-4 go beyond 5674-2 the word 6310 of the LORD 3068 my God, 430 to do 6213-2 less 6996 or more. 1419

22:19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry 3427-3 ye also here this night, 3915 that I may know 3045-4 what the LORD 3068 will say 1696-15 unto me more. 3254-55

22:20 And God 430 came 935-4 unto Balaam 1109 at night, 3915 and said 559-4 unto him, If the men 582 come 935-1 to call 7121-2 thee, rise up, 6965-3 [and] go 3212-3 with them; but yet 389 the word 1697 which I shall say 1696-17 unto thee, that shalt thou do. 6213-4

22:21 And Balaam 1109 rose up 6965-4 in the morning, 1242 and saddled 2280-4 his ass, 860 and went 3212-4 with the princes 8269 of Moab. 4124

22:22 And God's 430 anger 639 was kindled 2734-4 because he went: 1980-6 and the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 stood 3320-101 in the way 1870 for an adversary 7854 against him. Now he was riding 7392-6 upon his ass, 860 and his two 8147 servants 5288 [were] with him.

22:23 And the ass 860 saw 7200-4 the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 standing 5324-12 in the way, 1870 and his sword 2719 drawn 8025-7 in his hand: 3027 and the ass 860 turned aside 5186-4 out of the way, 1870 and went 3212-4 into the field: 7704 and Balaam 1109 smote 5221-55 the ass, 860 to turn 5186-53 her into the way. 1870

22:24 But the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 stood 5975-4 in a path 4934 of the vineyards, 3754 a wall 1447 [being] on this side, and a wall 1447 on that side.

22:25 And when the ass 860 saw 7200-4 the angel 4397 of the LORD, 3068 she thrust 3905-11 herself unto the wall, 7023 and crushed 3905-4 Balaam's 1109 foot 7272 against the wall: 7023 and he smote 5221-53 her again. 3254-55

22:26 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 went 5674-2 further, 3254-55 and stood 5975-4 in a narrow 6862 place, 4725 where [was] no way 1870 to turn 5186-2 either to the right hand 3225 or to the left. 8040

22:27 And when the ass 860 saw 7200-4 the angel 4397 of the LORD, 3068 she fell down 7257-4 under Balaam: 1109 and Balaam's 1109 anger 639 was kindled, 2734-4 and he smote 5221-55 the ass 860 with a staff. 4731

22:28 And the LORD 3068 opened 6605-4 the mouth 6310 of the ass, 860 and she said 559-4 unto Balaam, 1109 What have I done 6213-1 unto thee, that thou hast smitten 5221-52 me these three 7969 times? 7272

22:29 And Balaam 1109 said 559-4 unto the ass, 860 Because thou hast mocked 5953-98 me: I would 3863 there were 3426 a sword 2719 in mine hand, 3027 for now would I kill 2026-1 thee.

22:30 And the ass 860 said 559-4 unto Balaam, 1109 [Am] not I thine ass, 860 upon which thou hast ridden 7392-1 ever since [I was] thine unto this day? 3117 was I ever 5532-53 wont 5532-52 to do 6213-2 so unto thee? And he said, 559-4 Nay.

22:31 Then the LORD 3068 opened 1540-17 the eyes 5869 of Balaam, 1109 and he saw 7200-4 the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 standing 5324-12 in the way, 1870 and his sword 2719 drawn 8025-7 in his hand: 3027 and he bowed down his head, 6915-4 and fell flat 7812-101 on his face. 639

22:32 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten 5221-52 thine ass 860 these three 7969 times? 7272 behold, I went out 3318-1 to withstand 7854 thee, because [thy] way 1870 is perverse 3399-1 before me:

22:33 And the ass 860 saw 7200-4 me, and turned 5186-4 from me 6440 these three 7969 times: 7272 unless 194 she had turned 5186-1 from me, 6440 surely now also I had slain 2026-1 thee, and saved her alive. 2421-52

22:34 And Balaam 1109 said 559-4 unto the angel 4397 of the LORD, 3068 I have sinned; 2398-1 for I knew 3045-1 not that thou stoodest 5324-12 in the way 1870 against 7125-2 me: now therefore, if it displease 7489-1 thee, 5869 I will get me back again. 7725-4

22:35 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Balaam, 1109 Go 3212-3 with the men: 582 but only 657 the word 1697 that I shall speak 1696-17 unto thee, that thou shalt speak. 1696-17 So Balaam 1109 went 3212-4 with the princes 8269 of Balak. 1111

22:36 And when Balak 1111 heard 8085-4 that Balaam 1109 was come, 935-6 he went out 3318-4 to meet 7125-2 him unto a city 5892 of Moab, 4124 which [is] in the border 1366 of Arnon, 769 which [is] in the utmost 7097 coast. 1366

22:37 And Balak 1111 said 559-4 unto Balaam, 1109 Did I not earnestly 7971-2 send 7971-1 unto thee to call 7121-2 thee? wherefore camest 1980-1 thou not unto me? am I not able 3201-4 indeed 552 to promote thee to honour? 3513-15

22:38 And Balaam 1109 said 559-4 unto Balak, 1111 Lo, I am come 935-1 unto thee: have I now any power 3201-4 at all 3201-2 to say 1696-15 any thing? 3972 the word 1697 that God 430 putteth 7760-4 in my mouth, 6310 that shall I speak. 1696-17

22:39 And Balaam 1109 went 3212-4 with Balak, 1111 and they came 935-4 unto Kirjathhuzoth. 7151|2351|7155

22:40 And Balak 1111 offered 2076-4 oxen 1241 and sheep, 6629 and sent 7971-17 to Balaam, 1109 and to the princes 8269 that [were] with him.

22:41 And it came to pass on the morrow, 1242 that Balak 1111 took 3947-4 Balaam, 1109 and brought him up 5927-55 into the high places 1116 of Baal, 1120 that thence he might see 7200-4 the utmost 7097 [part] of the people. 5971

23:1 And Balaam 1109 said 559-4 unto Balak, 1111 Build 1129-3 me here seven 7651 altars, 4196 and prepare 3559-54 me here seven 7651 oxen 6499 and seven 7651 rams. 352

23:2 And Balak 1111 did 6213-4 as Balaam 1109 had spoken; 1696-14 and Balak 1111 and Balaam 1109 offered 5927-55 on [every] altar 4196 a bullock 6499 and a ram. 352

23:3 And Balaam 1109 said 559-4 unto Balak, 1111 Stand 3320-100 by thy burnt offering, 5930 and I will go: 3212-4 peradventure the LORD 3068 will come 7136-11 to meet 7125-2 me: and whatsoever 1697 he sheweth 7200-55 me I will tell 5046-52 thee. And he went 3212-4 to an high place. 8205

23:4 And God 430 met 7136-11 Balaam: 1109 and he said 559-4 unto him, I have prepared 6186-1 seven 7651 altars, 4196 and I have offered 5927-55 upon [every] altar 4196 a bullock 6499 and a ram. 352

23:5 And the LORD 3068 put 7760-4 a word 1697 in Balaam's 1109 mouth, 6310 and said, 559-4 Return 7725-3 unto Balak, 1111 and thus thou shalt speak. 1696-17

23:6 And he returned 7725-4 unto him, and, lo, he stood 5324-12 by his burnt sacrifice, 5930 he, and all the princes 8269 of Moab. 4124

23:7 And he took up 5375-4 his parable, 4912 and said, 559-4 Balak 1111 the king 4428 of Moab 4124 hath brought 5148-55 me from Aram, 758 out of the mountains 2042 of the east, 6924 [saying], Come, 3212-3 curse 779-3 me Jacob, 3290 and come, 3212-3 defy 2194-3 Israel. 3478

23:8 How 4100 shall I curse, 5344-4 whom God 410 hath not cursed? 6895-1 or how shall I defy, 2194-4 [whom] the LORD 3068 hath not defied? 2194-1

23:9 For from the top 7218 of the rocks 6697 I see 7200-4 him, and from the hills 1389 I behold 7789-4 him: lo, the people 5971 shall dwell 7931-4 alone, 910 and shall not be reckoned 2803-101 among the nations. 1471

23:10 Who can count 4487-1 the dust 6083 of Jacob, 3290 and the number 4557 of the fourth 7255 [part] of Israel? 3478 Let me 5315 die 4191-4 the death 4194 of the righteous, 3477 and let my last end 319 be like his!

23:11 And Balak 1111 said 559-4 unto Balaam, 1109 What hast thou done 6213-1 unto me? I took 3947-1 thee to curse 6895-2 mine enemies, 341-6 and, behold, thou hast blessed 1288-14 [them] altogether. 1288-15

23:12 And he answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 Must I not take heed 8104-4 to speak 1696-15 that which the LORD 3068 hath put 7760-4 in my mouth? 6310

23:13 And Balak 1111 said 559-4 unto him, Come, 3212-3 I pray thee, with me unto another 312 place, 4725 from whence thou mayest see 7200-4 them: thou shalt see 7200-4 but 657 the utmost part 7097 of them, and shalt not see 7200-4 them all: and curse 6895-3 me them from thence.

23:14 And he brought 3947-4 him into the field 7704 of Zophim, 6839|6822-6 to the top 7218 of Pisgah, 6449 and built 1129-4 seven 7651 altars, 4196 and offered 5927-55 a bullock 6499 and a ram 352 on [every] altar. 4196

23:15 And he said 559-4 unto Balak, 1111 Stand 3320-100 here 3541 by thy burnt offering, 5930 while I meet 7136-11 [the LORD] yonder. 3541

23:16 And the LORD 3068 met 7136-11 Balaam, 1109 and put 7760-4 a word 1697 in his mouth, 6310 and said, 559-4 Go again 7725-3 unto Balak, 1111 and say 1696-17 thus.

23:17 And when he came 935-4 to him, behold, he stood 5324-12 by his burnt offering, 5930 and the princes 8269 of Moab 4124 with him. And Balak 1111 said 559-4 unto him, What hath the LORD 3068 spoken? 1696-14

23:18 And he took up 5375-4 his parable, 4912 and said, 559-4 Rise up, 6965-3 Balak, 1111 and hear; 8085-3 hearken 238-54 unto me, thou son 1121 of Zippor: 6834

23:19 God 410 [is] not a man, 376 that he should lie; 3576-17 neither the son 1121 of man, 120 that he should repent: 5162-101 hath he said, 559-1 and shall he not do 6213-4 [it]? or hath he spoken, 1696-14 and shall he not make it good? 6965-55

23:20 Behold, I have received 3947-1 [commandment] to bless: 1288-15 and he hath blessed; 1288-14 and I cannot reverse 7725-55 it.

23:21 He hath not beheld 5027-52 iniquity 205 in Jacob, 3290 neither hath he seen 7200-1 perverseness 5999 in Israel: 3478 the LORD 3068 his God 430 [is] with him, and the shout 8643 of a king 4428 [is] among them.

23:22 God 410 brought them out 3318-56 of Egypt; 4714 he hath as it were the strength 8443 of an unicorn. 7214

23:23 Surely [there is] no enchantment 5173 against Jacob, 3290 neither [is there] any divination 7081 against Israel: 3478 according to this time 6256 it shall be said 559-11 of Jacob 3290 and of Israel, 3478 What hath God 410 wrought! 6466-1

23:24 Behold, the people 5971 shall rise up 6965-4 as a great lion, 3833 and lift up 5375-101 himself as a young lion: 738 he shall not lie down 7901-4 until he eat 398-4 [of] the prey, 2964 and drink 8354-4 the blood 1818 of the slain. 2491

23:25 And Balak 1111 said 559-4 unto Balaam, 1109 Neither curse 5344-4 them at all, 6895-2 nor bless 1288-17 them at all. 1288-15

23:26 But Balaam 1109 answered 6030-4 and said 559-4 unto Balak, 1111 Told 1696-14 not I thee, saying, 559-2 All that the LORD 3068 speaketh, 1696-17 that I must do? 6213-4

23:27 And Balak 1111 said 559-4 unto Balaam, 1109 Come, 3212-3 I pray thee, I will bring 3947-4 thee unto another 312 place; 4725 peradventure it will please 3474-4 5869 God 430 that thou mayest curse 6895-1 me them from thence.

23:28 And Balak 1111 brought 3947-4 Balaam 1109 unto the top 7218 of Peor, 6465 that looketh 8259-12 toward 6440 Jeshimon. 3452

23:29 And Balaam 1109 said 559-4 unto Balak, 1111 Build 1129-3 me here seven 7651 altars, 4196 and prepare 3559-54 me here seven 7651 bullocks 6499 and seven 7651 rams. 352

23:30 And Balak 1111 did 6213-4 as Balaam 1109 had said, 559-1 and offered 5927-55 a bullock 6499 and a ram 352 on [every] altar. 4196

24:1 And when Balaam 1109 saw 7200-4 that it pleased 5869 2895-1 the LORD 3068 to bless 1288-15 Israel, 3478 he went 1980-1 not, as at other times, 6471 6471 to seek 7125-2 for enchantments, 5173 but he set 7896-4 his face 6440 toward the wilderness. 4057

24:2 And Balaam 1109 lifted up 5375-4 his eyes, 5869 and he saw 7200-4 Israel 3478 abiding 7931-6 [in his tents] according to their tribes; 7626 and the spirit 7307 of God 430 came upon him.

24:3 And he took up 5375-4 his parable, 4912 and said, 559-4 Balaam 1109 the son 1121 of Beor 1160 hath said, 5002-7 and the man 1397 whose eyes 5869 are open 8365-7 hath said: 5002-7

24:4 He hath said, 5002-7 which heard 8085-6 the words 561 of God, 410 which saw 2372-4 the vision 4236 of the Almighty, 7706 falling 5307-6 [into a trance], but having his eyes 5869 open: 1540-7

24:5 How goodly 2895-1 are thy tents, 168 O Jacob, 3290 [and] thy tabernacles, 4908 O Israel! 3478

24:6 As the valleys 5158 are they spread forth, 5186-8 as gardens 1593 by the river's 5104 side, as the trees of lign aloes 174 which the LORD 3068 hath planted, 5193-1 [and] as cedar trees 730 beside the waters. 4325

24:7 He shall pour 5140-4 the water 4325 out of his buckets, 1805 and his seed 2233 [shall be] in many 7227 waters, 4325 and his king 4428 shall be higher 7311-4 than Agag, 90 and his kingdom 4438 shall be exalted. 5375-101

24:8 God 410 brought him forth 3318-56 out of Egypt; 4714 he hath as it were the strength 8443 of an unicorn: 7214 he shall eat 398-4 up the nations 1471 his enemies, 6862 and shall break 1633-17 their bones, 6106 and pierce 4272-4 [them] through with his arrows. 2671

24:9 He couched, 3766-1 he lay down 7901-1 as a lion, 738 and as a great lion: 3833 who shall stir him up? 6965-55 Blessed 1288-7 [is] he that blesseth 1288-18 thee, and cursed 779-7 [is] he that curseth 779-6 thee.

24:10 And Balak's 1111 anger 639 was kindled 2734-4 against Balaam, 1109 and he smote 5606-4 his hands 3709 together: and Balak 1111 said 559-4 unto Balaam, 1109 I called 7121-1 thee to curse 6895-2 mine enemies, 341-6 and, behold, thou hast altogether 1288-15 blessed 1288-14 [them] these three 7969 times. 6471

24:11 Therefore now flee 1272-3 thou to thy place: 4725 I thought 559-1 to promote thee unto great 3513-15 honour; 3513-17 but, lo, the LORD 3068 hath kept thee back 4513-1 from honour. 3519

24:12 And Balaam 1109 said 559-4 unto Balak, 1111 Spake 1696-14 I not also to thy messengers 4397 which thou sentest 7971-1 unto me, saying, 559-2

24:13 If Balak 1111 would give 5414-4 me his house 1004 full 4393 of silver 3701 and gold, 2091 I cannot 3808 3201-4 go beyond 5674-2 the commandment 6310 of the LORD, 3068 to do 6213-2 [either] good 2896 or bad 7451 of mine own mind; 3820 [but] what the LORD 3068 saith, 1696-17 that will I speak? 1696-17

24:14 And now, behold, I go 1980-6 unto my people: 5971 come 3212-3 [therefore, and] I will advertise 3289-4 thee what this people 5971 shall do 6213-4 to thy people 5971 in the latter 319 days. 3117

24:15 And he took up 5375-4 his parable, 4912 and said, 559-4 Balaam 1109 the son 1121 of Beor 1160 hath said, 5002-7 and the man 1397 whose eyes 5869 are open 8365-7 hath said: 5002-7

24:16 He hath said, 5002-7 which heard 8085-6 the words 561 of God, 410 and knew 3045-6 the knowledge 1847 of the most High, 5945 [which] saw 2372-4 the vision 4236 of the Almighty, 7706 falling 5307-6 [into a trance], but having his eyes 5869 open: 1540-7

24:17 I shall see 7200-4 him, but not now: I shall behold 7789-4 him, but not nigh: 7138 there shall come 1869-1 a Star 3556 out of Jacob, 3290 and a Sceptre 7626 shall rise 6965-1 out of Israel, 3478 and shall smite 4272-1 the corners 6285 of Moab, 4124 and destroy 6979-43 all the children 1121 of Sheth. 8352|8351

24:18 And Edom 123 shall be a possession, 3424 Seir 8165 also shall be a possession 3424 for his enemies; 341-6 and Israel 3478 shall do 6213-6 valiantly. 2428

24:19 Out of Jacob 3290 shall come he that shall have dominion, 7287-4 and shall destroy 6-52 him that remaineth 8300 of the city. 5892

24:20 And when he looked 7200-4 on Amalek, 6002 he took up 5375-4 his parable, 4912 and said, 559-4 Amalek 6002 [was] the first 7225 of the nations; 1471 but his latter end 319 [shall be] that he perish 8 for ever. 5703

24:21 And he looked 7200-4 on the Kenites, 70 7 and took up 5375-4 his parable, 4912 and said, 559-4 Strong 386 is thy dwellingplace, 4186 and thou puttest 7760-3 thy nest 7064 in a rock. 5553

24:22 Nevertheless 518 the Kenite 70 4 shall be wasted, 1197-15 until Asshur 804 shall carry thee away captive. 7617-4

24:23 And he took up 5375-4 his parable, 4912 and said, 559-4 Alas, 188 who shall live 2421-4 when God 410 doeth 7760-2 this!

24:24 And ships 6716 [shall come] from the coast 3027 of Chittim, 3794 and shall afflict 6031-14 Asshur, 804 and shall afflict 6031-14 Eber, 5677 and he also shall perish 8 for ever. 5703

24:25 And Balaam 1109 rose up, 6965-4 and went 3212-4 and returned 7725-4 to his place: 4725 and Balak 1111 also went 1980-1 his way. 1870

25:1 And Israel 3478 abode 3427-4 in Shittim, 7851 and the people 5971 began 2490-55 to commit whoredom 2181-2 with the daughters 1323 of Moab. 4124

25:2 And they called 7121-4 the people 5971 unto the sacrifices 2077 of their gods: 430 and the people 5971 did eat, 398-4 and bowed down 7812-101 to their gods. 430

25:3 And Israel 3478 joined 6775-11 himself unto Baalpeor: 1187 and the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 was kindled 2734-4 against Israel. 3478

25:4 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Take 3947-3 all the heads 7218 of the people, 5971 and hang them up 3363-54 before the LORD 3068 against 5048 the sun, 8121 that the fierce 2740 anger 639 of the LORD 3068 may be turned away 7725-4 from Israel. 3478

25:5 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto the judges 8199-6 of Israel, 3478 Slay 2026-3 ye every one 376 his men 582 that were joined 6775-12 unto Baalpeor. 1187

25:6 And, behold, one 376 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 came 935-6 and brought 7126-55 unto his brethren 251 a Midianitish woman 4084 in the sight 5869 of Moses, 4872 and in the sight 5869 of all the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 who [were] weeping 1058-6 [before] the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation. 4150

25:7 And when Phinehas, 6372 the son 1121 of Eleazar, 499 the son 1121 of Aaron 175 the priest, 3548 saw 7200-4 [it], he rose up 6965-4 from among 8432 the congregation, 5712 and took 3947-4 a javelin 7420 in his hand; 3027

25:8 And he went 935-4 after 310 the man 376 of Israel 3478 into the tent, 6898 and thrust both 8147 of them through, 1856-4 the man 376 of Israel, 3478 and the woman 802 through 413 her belly. 6897 So the plague 4046 was stayed 6113-11 from the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

25:9 And those that died 4191-5 in the plague 4046 were twenty 6242 and four 702 thousand. 505

25:10 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

25:11 Phinehas, 6372 the son 1121 of Eleazar, 499 the son 1121 of Aaron 175 the priest, 3548 hath turned my wrath 2534 away 7725-52 from the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 while he was zealous 7065-15 for my sake 7068 among 8432 them, that I consumed 3615-14 not the children 1121 of Israel 3478 in my jealousy. 7068

25:12 Wherefore say, 559-3 Behold, I give 5414-6 unto him my covenant 1285 of peace: 7965

25:13 And he shall have it, and his seed 2233 after 310 him, [even] the covenant 1285 of an everlasting 5769 priesthood; 3550 because 834 he was zealous 7065-14 for his God, 430 and made an atonement 3722-17 for the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

25:14 Now the name 8034 of the Israelite 376 3478 that was slain, 5221-94 [even] that was slain 5221-90 with the Midianitish woman, 4084 [was] Zimri, 2174 the son 1121 of Salu, 5543 a prince 5387 of a chief 1 house 1004 among the Simeonites. 8099

25:15 And the name 8034 of the Midianitish 4084 woman 802 that was slain 5221-94 [was] Cozbi, 3579 the daughter 1323 of Zur; 6698 he [was] head 7218 over a people, 523 [and] of a chief 1 house 1004 in Midian. 4080

25:16 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

25:17 Vex 6887-2 the Midianites, 4084 and smite 5221-52 them:

25:18 For they vex 6887-6 you with their wiles, 5231 wherewith they have beguiled 5230-14 you in the matter 1697 of Peor, 6465 and in the matter 1697 of Cozbi, 3579 the daughter 1323 of a prince 5387 of Midian, 4080 their sister, 269 which was slain 5221-94 in the day 3117 of the plague 4046 for Peor's 6465 sake. 1697

26:1 And it came to pass after 310 the plague, 4046 that the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto Moses 4872 and unto Eleazar 499 the son 1121 of Aaron 175 the priest, 3548 saying, 559-2

26:2 Take 5375-3 the sum 7218 of all the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 from twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 and upward, 4605 throughout their fathers' 1 house, 1004 all that are able to go 3318-6 to war 6635 in Israel. 3478

26:3 And Moses 4872 and Eleazar 499 the priest 3548 spake 1696-17 with them in the plains 6160 of Moab 4124 by Jordan 3383 [near] Jericho, 3405 saying, 559-2

26:4 [Take the sum of the people], from twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 and upward; 4605 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses 4872 and the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 which went forth 3318-6 out of the land 776 of Egypt. 4714

26:10 And the earth 776 opened 6605-4 her mouth, 6310 and swallowed them up 1104-4 together with Korah, 7141 when that company 5712 died, 4194 what time the fire 784 devoured 398-2 two hundred 3967 and fifty 2572 men: 376 and they became a sign. 5251

26:53 Unto these the land 776 shall be divided 2505-11 for an inheritance 5159 according to the number 4557 of names. 8034

26:54 To many 7227 thou shalt give the more 7235-55 inheritance, 5159 and to few 4592 thou shalt give the less 4591-55 inheritance: 5159 to every one 376 shall his inheritance 5159 be given 5414-93 according 6310 to those that were numbered 6485-7 of him.

26:55 Notwithstanding the land 776 shall be divided 2505-11 by lot: 1486 according to the names 8034 of the tribes 4294 of their fathers 1 they shall inherit. 5157-4

26:56 According 6310 to the lot 1486 shall the possession 5159 thereof be divided 2505-11 between many 7227 and few. 4592

26:57 And these [are] they that were numbered 6485-7 of the Levites 3881 after their families: 4940 of Gershon, 1648 the family 4940 of the Gershonites: 1649 of Kohath, 6955 the family 4940 of the Kohathites: 6956 of Merari, 4847 the family 4940 of the Merarites. 4848

26:58 These [are] the families 4940 of the Levites: 3881 the family 4940 of the Libnites, 3846 the family 4940 of the Hebronites, 2276 the family 4940 of the Mahlites, 4250 the family 4940 of the Mushites, 4188 the family 4940 of the Korathites. 7145 And Kohath 6955 begat 3205-52 Amram. 6019

26:59 And the name 8034 of Amram's 6019 wife 802 [was] Jochebed, 3115 the daughter 1323 of Levi, 3878 whom [her mother] bare 3205-1 to Levi 3878 in Egypt: 4714 and she bare 3205-4 unto Amram 6019 Aaron 175 and Moses, 4872 and Miriam 4813 their sister. 269

26:60 And unto Aaron 175 was born 3205-11 Nadab, 5070 and Abihu, 30 Eleazar, 499 and Ithamar. 385

26:61 And Nadab 5070 and Abihu 30 died, 4191-4 when they offered 7126-53 strange 2114-5 fire 784 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

26:62 And those that were numbered 6485-7 of them were twenty 6242 and three 7969 thousand, 505 all males 2145 from a month 2320 old 1121 and upward: 4605 for they were not numbered 6485-120 among 8432 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 because there was no inheritance 5159 given 5414-8 them among 8432 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

26:63 These [are] they that were numbered 6485-7 by Moses 4872 and Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 who numbered 6485-1 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 in the plains 6160 of Moab 4124 by Jordan 3383 [near] Jericho. 3405

26:64 But among these there was not a man 376 of them whom Moses 4872 and Aaron 175 the priest 3548 numbered, 6485-7 when they numbered 6485-1 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 in the wilderness 4057 of Sinai. 5514

26:65 For the LORD 3068 had said 559-1 of them, They shall surely 4191-2 die 4191-4 in the wilderness. 4057 And there was not left 3498-8 a man 376 of them, save Caleb 3612 the son 1121 of Jephunneh, 3312 and Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun. 5126

27:1 Then came 7126-4 the daughters 1323 of Zelophehad, 6765 the son 1121 of Hepher, 2660 the son 1121 of Gilead, 1568 the son 1121 of Machir, 4353 the son 1121 of Manasseh, 4519 of the families 4940 of Manasseh 4519 the son 1121 of Joseph: 3130 and these [are] the names 8034 of his daughters; 1323 Mahlah, 4244 Noah, 5270 and Hoglah, 2295 and Milcah, 4435 and Tirzah. 8656

27:2 And they stood 5975-4 before 6440 Moses, 4872 and before 6440 Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 and before 6440 the princes 5387 and all the congregation, 5712 [by] the door 6607 of the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 saying, 559-2

27:3 Our father 1 died 4191-1 in the wilderness, 4057 and he was not in 8432 the company 5712 of them that gathered themselves together 3259-12 against the LORD 3068 in the company 5712 of Korah; 7141 but died 4191-1 in his own sin, 2399 and had no sons. 1121

27:4 Why should the name 8034 of our father 1 be done away 1639-11 from among 8432 his family, 4940 because he hath no son? 1121 Give 5414-3 unto us [therefore] a possession 272 among 8432 the brethren 251 of our father. 1

27:5 And Moses 4872 brought 7126-55 their cause 4941 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

27:6 And the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

27:7 The daughters 1323 of Zelophehad 6765 speak 1696-6 right: 3651 thou shalt surely 5414-2 give 5414-4 them a possession 272 of an inheritance 5159 among 8432 their father's 1 brethren; 251 and thou shalt cause the inheritance 5159 of their father 1 to pass 5674-52 unto them.

27:8 And thou shalt speak 1696-17 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 If a man 376 die, 4191-4 and have no son, 1121 then ye shall cause his inheritance 5159 to pass 5674-52 unto his daughter. 1323

27:9 And if he have no daughter, 1323 then ye shall give 5414-1 his inheritance 5159 unto his brethren. 251

27:10 And if he have no brethren, 251 then ye shall give 5414-1 his inheritance 5159 unto his father's 1 brethren. 251

27:11 And if his father 1 have no brethren, 251 then ye shall give 5414-1 his inheritance 5159 unto his kinsman 7607 that is next 7138 to him of his family, 4940 and he shall possess 3423-1 it: and it shall be unto the children 1121 of Israel 3478 a statute 2708 of judgment, 4941 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

27:12 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Get thee up 5927-3 into this mount 2022 Abarim, 5682 and see 7200-3 the land 776 which I have given 5414-1 unto the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

27:13 And when thou hast seen 7200-1 it, thou also shalt be gathered 622-8 unto thy people, 5971 as Aaron 175 thy brother 251 was gathered. 622-8

27:14 For ye rebelled 4784-1 against my commandment 6310 in the desert 4057 of Zin, 6790 in the strife 4808 of the congregation, 5712 to sanctify 6942-53 me at the water 4325 before their eyes: 5869 that [is] the water 4325 of Meribah 4809 in Kadesh 6946 in the wilderness 4057 of Zin. 6790

27:15 And Moses 4872 spake 1696-17 unto the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2

27:16 Let the LORD, 3068 the God 430 of the spirits 7307 of all flesh, 1320 set 6485-4 a man 376 over the congregation, 5712

27:17 Which may go out 3318-4 before 6440 them, and which may go in 935-4 before 6440 them, and which may lead them out, 3318-55 and which may bring them in; 935-55 that the congregation 5712 of the LORD 3068 be not as sheep 6629 which have no shepherd. 7462-6

27:18 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Take 3947-3 thee Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun, 5126 a man 376 in whom [is] the spirit, 7307 and lay 5564-1 thine hand 3027 upon him;

27:19 And set 5975-52 him before 6440 Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 and before 6440 all the congregation; 5712 and give him a charge 6680-14 in their sight. 5869

27:20 And thou shalt put 5414-1 [some] of thine honour 1935 upon him, that all the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 may be obedient. 8085-4

27:21 And he shall stand 5975-4 before 6440 Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 who shall ask 7592-1 [counsel] for him after the judgment 4941 of Urim 224 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 at his word 6310 shall they go out, 3318-4 and at his word 6310 they shall come in, 935-4 [both] he, and all the children 1121 of Israel 3478 with him, even all the congregation. 5712

27:22 And Moses 4872 did 6213-4 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 him: and he took 3947-4 Joshua, 3091 and set 5975-55 him before 6440 Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 and before 6440 all the congregation: 5712

27:23 And he laid 5564-4 his hands 3027 upon him, and gave him a charge, 6680-17 as the LORD 3068 commanded 1696-14 by the hand 3027 of Moses. 4872

28:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

28:2 Command 6680-16 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, My offering, 7133 [and] my bread 3899 for my sacrifices made by fire, 801 [for] a sweet 5207 savour 7381 unto me, shall ye observe 8104-4 to offer 7126-53 unto me in their due season. 4150

28:3 And thou shalt say 559-1 unto them, This [is] the offering made by fire 801 which ye shall offer 7126-55 unto the LORD; 3068 two 8147 lambs 3532 of the first 1121 year 8141 without spot 8549 day by day, 3117 [for] a continual 8548 burnt offering. 5930

28:4 The one 259 lamb 3532 shalt thou offer 6213-4 in the morning, 1242 and the other 8145 lamb 3532 shalt thou offer 6213-4 at even; 6153

28:6 [It is] a continual 8548 burnt offering, 5930 which was ordained 6213-7 in mount 2022 Sinai 5514 for a sweet 5207 savour, 7381 a sacrifice made by fire 801 unto the LORD. 3068

28:7 And the drink offering 5262 thereof [shall be] the fourth 7243 [part] of an hin 1969 for the one 259 lamb: 3532 in the holy 6944 [place] shalt thou cause the strong wine 7941 to be poured 5258-54 unto the LORD 3068 [for] a drink offering. 5262

29:35 On the eighth 8066 day 3117 ye shall have a solemn assembly: 6116 ye shall do 6213-4 no servile 5656 work 4399 [therein]:

29:36 But ye shall offer 7126-52 a burnt offering, 5930 a sacrifice made by fire, 801 of a sweet 5207 savour 7381 unto the LORD: 3068 one 259 bullock, 6499 one 259 ram, 352 seven 7651 lambs 3532 of the first 1121 year 8141 without blemish: 8549

29:40 And Moses 4872 told 559-4 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 according to all that the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

30:1 And Moses 4872 spake 1696-17 unto the heads 7218 of the tribes 4294 concerning the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 This [is] the thing 1697 which the LORD 3068 hath commanded. 6680-14

30:2 If a man 376 vow 5087-4 a vow 5088 unto the LORD, 3068 or swear 7650-9 an oath 7621 to bind 631-2 his soul 5315 with a bond; 632 he shall not break 2490-55 his word, 1697 he shall do 6213-4 according to all that proceedeth 3318-6 out of his mouth. 6310

30:3 If a woman 802 also vow 5087-4 a vow 5088 unto the LORD, 3068 and bind 631-1 herself by a bond, 632 [being] in her father's 1 house 1004 in her youth; 5271

30:4 And her father 1 hear 8085-1 her vow, 5088 and her bond 632 wherewith she hath bound 631-1 her soul, 5315 and her father 1 shall hold his peace 2790-52 at her: then all her vows 5088 shall stand, 6965-1 and every bond 632 wherewith she hath bound 631-1 her soul 5315 shall stand. 6965-4

30:5 But if her father 1 disallow 5106-52 her in the day 3117 that he heareth; 8085-2 not any of her vows, 5088 or of her bonds 632 wherewith she hath bound 631-1 her soul, 5315 shall stand: 6965-4 and the LORD 3068 shall forgive 5545-4 her, because her father 1 disallowed 5106-52 her.

30:6 And if she had at all an husband, 376 when she vowed, 5088 or uttered 4008 ought out of her lips, 8193 wherewith she bound 631-1 her soul; 5315

30:7 And her husband 376 heard 8085-1 [it,] and held his peace 2790-52 at her in the day 3117 that he heard 8085-2 [it]: then her vows 5088 shall stand, 6965-1 and her bonds 632 wherewith she bound 631-1 her soul 5315 shall stand. 6965-4

30:8 But if her husband 376 disallowed 5106-55 her on the day 3117 that he heard 8085-2 [it]; then he shall make her vow 5088 which 834 she vowed, 5921 and that which she uttered 4008 with her lips, 8193 wherewith she bound 631-1 her soul, 5315 of none effect: 6565-52 and the LORD 3068 shall forgive 5545-4 her.

30:9 But every vow 5088 of a widow, 490 and of her that is divorced, 1644-7 wherewith they have bound 631-1 their souls, 5315 shall stand 6965-4 against her.

30:10 And if she vowed 5087-1 in her husband's 376 house, 1004 or bound 631-1 her soul 5315 by a bond 632 with an oath; 7621

30:11 And her husband 376 heard 8085-1 [it], and held his peace 2790-52 at her, [and] disallowed 5106-52 her not: then all her vows 5088 shall stand, 6965-1 and every bond 632 wherewith she bound 631-1 her soul 5315 shall stand. 6965-4

30:12 But if her husband 376 hath utterly 6565-53 made them void 6565-55 on the day 3117 he heard 8085-2 [them; then] whatsoever proceeded 4161 out of her lips 8193 concerning her vows, 5088 or concerning the bond 632 of her soul, 5315 shall not stand: 6965-4 her husband 376 hath made them void; 6565-52 and the LORD 3068 shall forgive 5545-4 her.

30:13 Every vow, 5088 and every binding 632 oath 7621 to afflict 6031-15 the soul, 5315 her husband 376 may establish 6965-55 it, or her husband 376 may make it void. 6565-55

30:14 But if her husband 376 altogether 2790-53 hold his peace 2790-55 at her from day 3117 to day; 3117 then he establisheth 6965-52 all her vows, 5088 or all her bonds, 632 which [are] upon her: he confirmeth 6965-52 them, because he held his peace 2790-52 at her in the day 3117 that he heard 8085-2 [them].

30:15 But if he shall any ways 6565-53 make them void 6565-55 after 310 that he hath heard 8085-2 [them]; then he shall bear 5375-1 her iniquity. 5771

30:16 These [are] the statutes, 2706 which the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses, 4872 between a man 376 and his wife, 802 between the father 1 and his daughter, 1323 [being yet] in her youth 5271 in her father's 1 house. 1004

31:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

31:2 Avenge 5358-3 5360 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 of the Midianites: 4084 afterward 310 shalt thou be gathered 622-11 unto thy people. 5971

31:3 And Moses 4872 spake 1696-17 unto the people, 5971 saying, 559-2 Arm 2502-10 some 582 of yourselves unto the war, 6635 and let them go against the Midianites, 4080 and avenge 5414-2 5360 the LORD 3068 of Midian. 4080

31:4 Of every tribe 4294 4294 a thousand, 505 505 throughout all the tribes 4294 of Israel, 3478 shall ye send 7971-4 to the war. 6635

31:5 So there were delivered 4560-11 out of the thousands 505 of Israel, 3478 a thousand 505 of [every] tribe, 4294 twelve 8147 6240 thousand 505 armed 2502-7 for war. 6635

31:6 And Moses 4872 sent 7971-4 them to the war, 6635 a thousand 505 of [every] tribe, 4294 them and Phinehas 6372 the son 1121 of Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 to the war, 6635 with the holy 6944 instruments, 3627 and the trumpets 2689 to blow 8643 in his hand. 3027

31:7 And they warred 6633-4 against the Midianites, 4080 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses; 4872 and they slew 2026-4 all the males. 2145

31:8 And they slew 2026-1 the kings 4428 of Midian, 4080 beside the rest 5921 of them that were slain; 2491 [namely], Evi, 189 and Rekem, 7552 and Zur, 6698 and Hur, 2354 and Reba, 7254 five 2568 kings 4428 of Midian: 4080 Balaam 1109 also the son 1121 of Beor 1160 they slew 2026-1 with the sword. 2719

31:9 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 took [all] the women 802 of Midian 4080 captives, 7617-4 and their little ones, 2945 and took the spoil 962-1 of all their cattle, 929 and all their flocks, 4735 and all their goods. 2428

31:10 And they burnt 8313-1 all their cities 5892 wherein they dwelt, 4186 and all their goodly castles, 2918 with fire. 784

31:11 And they took 3947-4 all the spoil, 7998 and all the prey, 4455 [both] of men 120 and of beasts. 929

31:12 And they brought 935-55 the captives, 7628 and the prey, 4455 and the spoil, 7998 unto Moses, 4872 and Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 and unto the congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 unto the camp 4264 at the plains 6160 of Moab, 4124 which [are] by Jordan 3383 [near] Jericho. 3405

31:13 And Moses, 4872 and Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 and all the princes 5387 of the congregation, 5712 went forth 3318-4 to meet 7125-2 them without 2351 the camp. 4264

31:14 And Moses 4872 was wroth 7107-4 with the officers 6485-7 of the host, 2428 [with] the captains 8269 over thousands, 505 and captains 8269 over hundreds, 3967 which came 935-6 from 6635 the battle. 4421

31:15 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto them, Have ye saved all the women 5347 alive? 2421-14

31:16 Behold, these 2007 caused 1961-1 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 through the counsel 1697 of Balaam, 1109 to commit 4560-2 trespass 4604 against the LORD 3068 in the matter 1697 of Peor, 6465 and there was a plague 4046 among the congregation 5712 of the LORD. 3068

31:17 Now therefore kill 2026-3 every male 2145 among the little ones, 2945 and kill 2026-3 every woman 802 that hath known 3045-6 man 376 by lying 4904 with him. 2145

31:18 But all the women 802 children, 2945 that have not known 3045-1 a man 2145 by lying 4904 with him, keep alive 2421-54 for yourselves.

31:19 And do ye abide 2583-3 without 2351 the camp 4264 seven 7651 days: 3117 whosoever hath killed 2026-6 any person, 5315 and whosoever hath touched 5060-6 any slain, 2491 purify 2398-101 [both] yourselves and your captives 7628 on the third 7992 day, 3117 and on the seventh 7637 day. 3117

31:20 And purify 2398-101 all [your] raiment, 899 and all that is made 3627 of skins, 5785 and all work 4639 of goats' 5795 [hair], and all things made 3627 of wood. 6086

31:21 And Eleazar 499 the priest 3548 said 559-4 unto the men 582 of war 6635 which went 935-6 to the battle, 4421 This [is] the ordinance 2708 of the law 8451 which the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses; 4872

31:22 Only the gold, 2091 and the silver, 3701 the brass, 5178 the iron, 1270 the tin, 913 and the lead, 5777

31:23 Every thing 1697 that may abide 935-4 the fire, 784 ye shall make [it] go 5674-55 through the fire, 784 and it shall be clean: 2891-1 nevertheless it shall be purified 2398-101 with the water 4325 of separation: 5079 and all that abideth 935-4 not the fire 784 ye shall make go 5674-55 through the water. 4325

31:24 And ye shall wash 3526-14 your clothes 899 on the seventh 7637 day, 3117 and ye shall be clean, 2891-1 and afterward 310 ye shall come 935-4 into the camp. 4264

31:25 And the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

31:26 Take 5375-3 the sum 7218 of the prey 4455 that was taken, 7628 [both] of man 120 and of beast, 929 thou, and Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 and the chief 7218 fathers 1 of the congregation: 5712

31:27 And divide 2673-1 the prey 4455 into two parts; between them that took 8610-6 the war 4421 upon them, who went out 3318-6 to battle, 6635 and between all the congregation: 5712

31:28 And levy 7311-52 a tribute 4371 unto the LORD 3068 of the men 582 of war 4421 which went out 3318-6 to battle: 6635 one 259 soul 5315 of five 2568 hundred, 3967 [both] of the persons, 120 and of the beeves, 1241 and of the asses, 2543 and of the sheep: 6629

31:29 Take 3947-4 [it] of their half, 4276 and give 5414-1 it unto Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 [for] an heave offering 8641 of the LORD. 3068

31:30 And of the children 1121 of Israel's 3478 half, 4276 thou shalt take 3947-4 one 259 portion 270-7 of fifty, 2572 of the persons, 120 of the beeves, 1241 of the asses, 2543 and of the flocks, 6629 of all manner of beasts, 929 and give 5414-1 them unto the Levites, 3881 which keep 8104-6 the charge 4931 of the tabernacle 4908 of the LORD. 3068

31:31 And Moses 4872 and Eleazar 499 the priest 3548 did 6213-4 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

31:32 And the booty, 4455 [being] the rest 3499 of the prey 957 which the men 5971 of war 6635 had caught, 962-1 was six 8337 hundred 3967 thousand 505 and seventy 7657 thousand 505 and five 2568 thousand 505 sheep, 6629

31:33 And threescore and twelve 7657 8147 thousand 505 beeves, 1241

31:34 And threescore 8346 and one 259 thousand 505 asses, 2543

31:35 And thirty 7970 and two 8147 thousand 505 persons 5315 120 in all, 3605 5315 of women 802 that had not known 3045-1 man 2145 by lying 4904 with him.

31:36 And the half, 4275 [which was] the portion 2506 of them that went out 3318-6 to war, 6635 was in number 4557 three 7969 hundred 3967 thousand 505 and seven 7651 and thirty 7970 thousand 505 and five 2568 hundred 3967 sheep: 6629

31:37 And the LORD'S 3068 tribute 4371 of the sheep 6629 was six 8337 hundred 3967 and threescore and fifteen. 7657 2568

31:38 And the beeves 1241 [were] thirty 7970 and six 8337 thousand; 505 of which the LORD'S 3068 tribute 4371 [was] threescore and twelve. 7657 8147

31:39 And the asses 2543 [were] thirty 7970 thousand 505 and five 2568 hundred; 3967 of which the LORD'S 3068 tribute 4371 [was] threescore 8346 and one. 259

31:40 And the persons 120 5315 [were] sixteen 8337 6240 thousand; 505 of which the LORD'S 3068 tribute 4371 [was] thirty 7970 and two 8147 persons. 5315

31:41 And Moses 4872 gave 5414-4 the tribute, 4371 [which was] the LORD'S 3068 heave offering, 8641 unto Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

31:42 And of the children 1121 of Israel's 3478 half, 4276 which Moses 4872 divided 2673-1 from the men 582 that warred, 6633-6

31:43 (Now the half 4275 [that pertained unto] the congregation 5712 was three 7969 hundred 3967 thousand 505 and thirty 7970 thousand 505 [and] seven 7651 thousand 505 and five 2568 hundred 3967 sheep, 4480 6629

31:44 And thirty 7970 and six 8337 thousand 505 beeves, 1241

31:45 And thirty 7970 thousand 505 asses 2543 and five 2568 hundred, 3967

31:46 And sixteen 8337 6240 thousand 505 persons;) 5315 120

31:47 Even of the children 1121 of Israel's 3478 half, 4276 Moses 4872 took 3947-4 one 259 portion 270-7 of fifty, 2572 [both] of man 120 and of beast, 929 and gave 5414-4 them unto the Levites, 3881 which kept 8104-6 the charge 4931 of the tabernacle 4908 of the LORD; 3068 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

31:48 And the officers 6485-7 which [were] over thousands 505 of the host, 6635 the captains 8269 of thousands, 505 and captains 8269 of hundreds, 3967 came near 7126-4 unto Moses: 4872

31:49 And they said 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 Thy servants 5650 have taken 5375-1 the sum 7218 of the men 582 of war 4421 which [are] under our charge, 3027 and there lacketh 6485-8 not one man 376 of us.

31:50 We have therefore brought 7126-55 an oblation 7133 for the LORD, 3068 what every man 376 hath gotten, 4672-1 of jewels 3627 of gold, 2091 chains, 685 and bracelets, 6781 rings, 2885 earrings, 5694 and tablets, 3558 to make an atonement 3722-15 for our souls 5315 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

31:51 And Moses 4872 and Eleazar 499 the priest 3548 took 3947-4 the gold 2091 of them, [even] all wrought 4639 jewels. 3627

31:52 And all the gold 2091 of the offering 8641 that they offered up 7311-52 to the LORD, 3068 of the captains 8269 of thousands, 505 and of the captains 8269 of hundreds, 3967 was sixteen 8337 6240 thousand 505 seven 7651 hundred 3967 and fifty 2572 shekels. 8255

31:53 ([For] the men 582 of war 6635 had taken spoil, 962-1 every man 376 for himself.)

31:54 And Moses 4872 and Eleazar 499 the priest 3548 took 3947-4 the gold 2091 of the captains 8269 of thousands 505 and of hundreds, 3967 and brought 935-55 it into the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 [for] a memorial 2146 for the children 1121 of Israel 3478 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

32:1 Now the children 1121 of Reuben 7205 and the children 1121 of Gad 1410 had a very 3966 great 6099 multitude 7227 of cattle: 4735 and when they saw 7200-4 the land 776 of Jazer, 3270 and the land 776 of Gilead, 1568 that, behold, the place 4725 [was] a place 4725 for cattle; 4735

32:2 The children 1121 of Gad 1410 and the children 1121 of Reuben 7205 came 935-4 and spake 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 and to Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 and unto the princes 5387 of the congregation, 5712 saying, 559-2

32:3 Ataroth, 5852 and Dibon, 1769 and Jazer, 3270 and Nimrah, 5247 and Heshbon, 2809 and Elealeh, 500 and Shebam, 7643 and Nebo, 5015 and Beon, 1194

32:4 [Even] the country 776 which the LORD 3068 smote 5221-52 before 6440 the congregation 5712 of Israel, 3478 [is] a land 776 for cattle, 4735 and thy servants 5650 have cattle: 4735

32:5 Wherefore, said 559-4 they, if we have found 4672-1 grace 2580 in thy sight, 5869 let this land 776 be given 5414-93 unto thy servants 5650 for a possession, 272 [and] bring us not over 5674-55 Jordan. 3383

32:6 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto the children 1121 of Gad 1410 and to the children 1121 of Reuben, 7205 Shall your brethren 251 go 935-4 to war, 4421 and shall ye sit 3427-4 here?

32:7 And wherefore discourage 5106-55|5106-4-k ye the heart 3820 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 from going over 5674-2 into the land 776 which the LORD 3068 hath given 5414-1 them?

32:8 Thus did 6213-1 your fathers, 1 when I sent 7971-2 them from Kadeshbarnea 6947 to see 7200-2 the land. 776

32:9 For when they went up 5927-4 unto the valley 5158 of Eshcol, 812 and saw 7200-4 the land, 776 they discouraged 5106-55 the heart 3820 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 that they should not go 935-2 into the land 776 which the LORD 3068 had given 5414-1 them.

32:10 And the LORD'S 3068 anger 639 was kindled 2734-4 the same time, 3117 and he sware, 7650-11 saying, 559-2

32:11 Surely none 518 of the men 582 that came up 5927-6 out of Egypt, 4714 from twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 and upward, 4605 shall see 7200-4 the land 127 which I sware 7650-8 unto Abraham, 85 unto Isaac, 3327 and unto Jacob; 3290 because they have not wholly 4390-14 followed 310 me:

32:12 Save Caleb 3612 the son 1121 of Jephunneh 3312 the Kenezite, 7074 and Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun: 5126 for they have wholly 4390-14 followed 310 the LORD. 3068

32:13 And the LORD'S 3068 anger 639 was kindled 2734-4 against Israel, 3478 and he made them wander 5128-55 in the wilderness 4057 forty 705 years, 8141 until all the generation, 1755 that had done 6213-6 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 was consumed. 8552-2

32:14 And, behold, ye are risen up 6965-1 in your fathers' 1 stead, an increase 8635 of sinful 2400 men, 582 to augment 5595-2 yet the fierce 2740 anger 639 of the LORD 3068 toward Israel. 3478

32:15 For if ye turn away 7725-4 from after 310 him, he will yet again 3254-1 leave 3240-53 them in the wilderness; 4057 and ye shall destroy 7843-14 all this people. 5971

32:16 And they came near 5066-4 unto him, and said, 559-4 We will build 1129-4 sheepfolds 1448 6629 here for our cattle, 4735 and cities 5892 for our little ones: 2945

32:17 But we ourselves 587 will go ready 2363-7 armed 2502-11 before 6440 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 until we have brought 935-52 them unto their place: 4725 and our little ones 2945 shall dwell 3427-1 in the fenced 4013 cities 5892 because 6440 of the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land. 776

32:18 We will not return 7725-4 unto our houses, 1004 until the children 1121 of Israel 3478 have inherited 5157-99 every man 376 his inheritance. 5159

32:19 For we will not inherit 5157-4 with them on yonder side 5676 Jordan, 3383 or forward; 1973 because our inheritance 5159 is fallen 935-1 to us on this side 5676 Jordan 3383 eastward. 4217

32:20 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto them, If ye will do 6213-4 this thing, 1697 if ye will go armed 2502-11 before 6440 the LORD 3068 to war, 4421

32:21 And will go all of you armed 2502-7 over 5674-1 Jordan 3383 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 until he hath driven out 3423-53 his enemies 341-6 from before 6440 him,

32:22 And the land 776 be subdued 3533-8 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 then afterward 310 ye shall return, 7725-4 and be guiltless 5355 before the LORD, 3068 and before Israel; 3478 and this land 776 shall be your possession 272 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

32:23 But if ye will not do 6213-4 so, behold, ye have sinned 2398-1 against the LORD: 3068 and be sure 3045-3 your sin 2403 will find you out. 4672-4

32:24 Build 1129-3 you cities 5892 for your little ones, 2945 and folds 1448 for your sheep; 6792 and do 6213-4 that which hath proceeded 3318-6 out of your mouth. 6310

32:25 And the children 1121 of Gad 1410 and the children 1121 of Reuben 7205 spake 559-4 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2 Thy servants 5650 will do 6213-4 as my lord 113 commandeth. 6680-18

32:26 Our little ones, 2945 our wives, 802 our flocks, 4735 and all our cattle, 929 shall be there in the cities 5892 of Gilead: 1568

32:27 But thy servants 5650 will pass over, 5674-4 every man armed 2502-7 for war, 6635 before 6440 the LORD 3068 to battle, 4421 as my lord 113 saith. 1696-6

32:28 So concerning them Moses 4872 commanded 6680-17 Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 and Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun, 5126 and the chief 7218 fathers 1 of the tribes 4294 of the children 1121 of Israel: 3478

32:29 And Moses 4872 said 559-4 unto them, If the children 1121 of Gad 1410 and the children 1121 of Reuben 7205 will pass with you over 5674-4 Jordan, 3383 every man armed 2502-7 to battle, 4421 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and the land 776 shall be subdued 3533-8 before 6440 you; then ye shall give 5414-1 them the land 776 of Gilead 1568 for a possession: 272

32:30 But if they will not pass over 5674-4 with you armed, 2502-7 they shall have possessions 270-8 among 8432 you in the land 776 of Canaan. 3667

32:31 And the children 1121 of Gad 1410 and the children 1121 of Reuben 7205 answered, 6030-4 saying, 559-2 As the LORD 3068 hath said 1696-14 unto thy servants, 5650 so will we do. 6213-4

32:32 We 5168 will pass over 5674-4 armed 2502-7 before 6440 the LORD 3068 into the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 that the possession 272 of our inheritance 5159 on this side 5676 Jordan 3383 [may be] ours.

32:33 And Moses 4872 gave 5414-4 unto them, [even] to the children 1121 of Gad, 1410 and to the children 1121 of Reuben, 7205 and unto half 2677 the tribe 7626 of Manasseh 4519 the son 1121 of Joseph, 3130 the kingdom 4467 of Sihon 5511 king 4428 of the Amorites, 567 and the kingdom 4467 of Og 5747 king 4428 of Bashan, 1316 the land, 776 with the cities 5892 thereof in the coasts, 1367 [even] the cities 5892 of the country 776 round about. 5439

32:34 And the children 1121 of Gad 1410 built 1129-4 Dibon, 1769 and Ataroth, 5852 and Aroer, 6177

32:35 And Atroth, Shophan, 5855 and Jaazer, 3270 and Jogbehah, 3011

32:36 And Bethnimrah, 1039 and Bethharan, 1028 fenced 4013 cities: 5892 and folds 1448 for sheep. 6629

32:37 And the children 1121 of Reuben 7205 built 1129-1 Heshbon, 2809 and Elealeh, 500 and Kirjathaim, 7156

32:38 And Nebo, 5015 and Baalmeon, 1186 (their names 8034 being changed,) 4142-94 and Shibmah: 7643 and gave 7121-4 other names 8034 8034 unto the cities 5892 which they builded. 1129-1

32:39 And the children 1121 of Machir 4353 the son 1121 of Manasseh 4519 went 3212-4 to Gilead, 1568 and took 3920-4 it, and dispossessed 3423-55 the Amorite 567 which [was] in it.

32:40 And Moses 4872 gave 5414-4 Gilead 1568 unto Machir 4353 the son 1121 of Manasseh; 4519 and he dwelt 3427-4 therein.

32:41 And Jair 2971 the son 1121 of Manasseh 4519 went 1980-1 and took 3920-4 the small towns 2333 thereof, and called 7121-4 them Havothjair. 2334

32:42 And Nobah 5025 went 1980-1 and took 3920-4 Kenath, 7079 and the villages 1323 thereof, and called 7121-4 it Nobah, 5025 after his own name. 8034

33:1 These [are] the journeys 4550 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 which went forth 3318-1 out of the land 776 of Egypt 4714 with their armies 6635 under the hand 3027 of Moses 4872 and Aaron. 175

33:2 And Moses 4872 wrote 3789-4 their goings out 4161 according to their journeys 4550 by the commandment 6310 of the LORD: 3068 and these [are] their journeys 4550 according to their goings out. 4161

33:3 And they departed 5265-4 from Rameses 7486 in the first 7223 month, 2320 on the fifteenth 6240 2568 day 3117 of the first 7223 month; 2320 on the morrow 4283 after the passover 6453 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 went out 3318-1 with an high 7311-6 hand 3027 in the sight 5869 of all the Egyptians. 4714

33:4 For the Egyptians 4714 buried 6912-18 all [their] firstborn, 1060 which the LORD 3068 had smitten 5221-52 among them: upon their gods 430 also the LORD 3068 executed 6213-1 judgments. 8201

33:5 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 removed 5265-4 from Rameses, 7486 and pitched 2583-4 in Succoth. 5523

33:6 And they departed 5265-4 from Succoth, 5523 and pitched 2583-4 in Etham, 864 which [is] in the edge 7097 of the wilderness. 4057

33:38 And Aaron 175 the priest 3548 went up 5927-4 into mount 2022 Hor 2023 at the commandment 6310 of the LORD, 3068 and died 4191-4 there, in the fortieth 705 year 8141 after the children 1121 of Israel 3478 were come out 3318-2 of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 in the first 259 [day] of the fifth 2549 month. 2320 2320

33:50 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses 4872 in the plains 6160 of Moab 4124 by Jordan 3383 [near] Jericho, 3405 saying, 559-2

33:51 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, When ye are passed over 5674-6 Jordan 3383 into the land 776 of Canaan; 3667

33:52 Then ye shall drive out 3423-52 all the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land 776 from before 6440 you, and destroy 6-14 all their pictures, 4906 and destroy 6-17 all their molten 4541 images, 6754 and quite pluck down 8045-55 all their high places: 1116

33:53 And ye shall dispossess 3423-52 [the inhabitants] of the land, 776 and dwell 3427-1 therein: for I have given 5414-1 you the land 776 to possess 3423-2 it.

33:54 And ye shall divide the land 776 by lot 1486 for an inheritance 5157-98 among your families: 4940 [and] to the more 7227 ye shall give the more 7235-55 inheritance, 5159 and to the fewer 4592 ye shall give the less 4591-55 inheritance: 5159 every man's [inheritance] shall be in the place where his lot 1486 falleth; 3318-4 according to the tribes 4294 of your fathers 1 ye shall inherit. 5157-101

33:55 But if ye will not drive out 3423-55 the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land 776 from before 6440 you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain 3498-55 of them [shall be] pricks 7899 in your eyes, 5869 and thorns 6796 in your sides, 6654 and shall vex 6887-1 you in the land 776 wherein ye dwell. 3427-6

33:56 Moreover it shall come to pass, [that] I shall do 6213-4 unto you, as I thought 1819-14 to do 6213-2 unto them.

34:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

34:2 Command 6680-16 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, When ye come 935-6 into the land 776 of Canaan; 3667 (this [is] the land 776 that shall fall 5307-4 unto you for an inheritance, 5159 [even] the land 776 of Canaan 3667 with the coasts 1367 thereof:)

34:3 Then your south 5045 quarter 6285 shall be from the wilderness 4057 of Zin 6790 along by the coast 3027 of Edom, 123 and your south 5045 border 1366 shall be the outmost coast 7097 of the salt 4417 sea 3220 eastward: 6924

34:4 And your border 1366 shall turn 5437-8 from the south 5045 to the ascent of Akrabbim, 4608|6137|4610 and pass on 5674-1 to Zin: 6790 and the going forth 8444 thereof shall be from the south 5045 to Kadeshbarnea, 6947 and shall go on 3318-1 to Hazaraddar, 2692 and pass on 5674-1 to Azmon: 6111

34:5 And the border 1366 shall fetch a compass 5437-8 from Azmon 6111 unto the river 5158 of Egypt, 4714 and the goings out 8444 of it shall be at the sea. 3220

34:6 And [as for] the western 3220 border, 1366 ye shall even have the great 1419 sea 3220 for a border: 1366 this shall be your west 3220 border. 1366

34:7 And this shall be your north 6828 border: 1366 from the great 1419 sea 3220 ye shall point out 8376-17 for you mount 2022 Hor: 2023

34:8 From mount 2022 Hor 2023 ye shall point out 8376-17 [your border] unto the entrance 935-2 of Hamath; 2574 and the goings forth 8444 of the border 1366 shall be to Zedad: 6657

34:9 And the border 1366 shall go on 3318-1 to Ziphron, 2202 and the goings out 8444 of it shall be at Hazarenan: 2704 this shall be your north 6828 border. 1366

34:10 And ye shall point out 184-98 your east 6924 border 1366 from Hazarenan 2704 to Shepham: 8221

34:11 And the coast 1366 shall go down 3381-1 from Shepham 8221 to Riblah, 7247 on the east side 6924 of Ain; 5871 and the border 1366 shall descend, 3381-1 and shall reach 4229-1 unto the side 3802 of the sea 3220 of Chinnereth 3672 eastward: 6924

34:12 And the border 1366 shall go down 3381-1 to Jordan, 3383 and the goings out 8444 of it shall be at the salt 4417 sea: 3220 this shall be your land 776 with the coasts 1367 thereof round about. 5439

34:13 And Moses 4872 commanded 6680-17 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 This [is] the land 776 which ye shall inherit 5157-101 by lot, 1486 which the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 to give 5414-2 unto the nine 8672 tribes, 4294 and to the half 2677 tribe: 4294

34:14 For the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Reuben 7206 according to the house 1004 of their fathers, 1 and the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Gad 1425 according to the house 1004 of their fathers, 1 have received 3947-1 [their inheritance]; and half 2677 the tribe 4294 of Manasseh 4519 have received 3947-1 their inheritance: 5159

34:15 The two 8147 tribes 4294 and the half 2677 tribe 4294 have received 3947-1 their inheritance 5159 on this side 5676 Jordan 3383 [near] Jericho 3405 eastward, 6924 toward the sunrising. 4217

34:16 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

34:17 These [are] the names 8034 of the men 582 which shall divide 5157-4 the land 776 unto you: Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 and Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun. 5126

34:18 And ye shall take 3947-4 one 259 5387 prince 259 5387 of every tribe, 4294 to divide the land 776 by inheritance. 5157-2

34:19 And the names 8034 of the men 582 [are] these: Of the tribe 4294 of Judah, 3063 Caleb 3612 the son 1121 of Jephunneh. 3312

34:20 And of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Simeon, 8095 Shemuel 8050 the son 1121 of Ammihud. 5989

34:21 Of the tribe 4294 of Benjamin, 1144 Elidad 449 the son 1121 of Chislon. 3692

34:22 And the prince 5387 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Dan, 1835 Bukki 1231 the son 1121 of Jogli. 3020

34:23 The prince 5387 of the children 1121 of Joseph, 3130 for the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Manasseh, 4519 Hanniel 2592 the son 1121 of Ephod. 641

34:24 And the prince 5387 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Ephraim, 669 Kemuel 7055 the son 1121 of Shiphtan. 8204

34:25 And the prince 5387 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Zebulun, 2074 Elizaphan 469 the son 1121 of Parnach. 6535

34:26 And the prince 5387 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Issachar, 3485 Paltiel 6409 the son 1121 of Azzan. 5821

34:27 And the prince 5387 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Asher, 836 Ahihud 282 the son 1121 of Shelomi. 8015

34:28 And the prince 5387 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Naphtali, 5321 Pedahel 6300 the son 1121 of Ammihud. 5989

34:29 These [are they] whom the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 to divide the inheritance 5157-15 unto the children 1121 of Israel 3478 in the land 776 of Canaan. 3667

35:1 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses 4872 in the plains 6160 of Moab 4124 by Jordan 3383 [near] Jericho, 3405 saying, 559-2

35:2 Command 6680-16 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 that they give 5414-1 unto the Levites 3881 of the inheritance 5159 of their possession 272 cities 5892 to dwell in; 3427-2 and ye shall give 5414-4 [also] unto the Levites 3881 suburbs 4054 for the cities 5892 round about 5439 them.

35:3 And the cities 5892 shall they have to dwell in; 3427-2 and the suburbs 4054 of them shall be for their cattle, 929 and for their goods, 7399 and for all their beasts. 2416

35:4 And the suburbs 4054 of the cities, 5892 which ye shall give 5414-4 unto the Levites, 3881 [shall reach] from the wall 7023 of the city 5892 and outward 2351 a thousand 505 cubits 520 round about. 5439

35:5 And ye shall measure 4058-1 from without 2351 the city 5892 on the east 6924 side 6285 two thousand 505 cubits, 520 and on the south 5045 side 6285 two thousand 505 cubits, 520 and on the west 3220 side 6285 two thousand 505 cubits, 520 and on the north 6828 side 6285 two thousand 505 cubits; 520 and the city 5892 [shall be] in the midst: 8432 this shall be to them the suburbs 4054 of the cities. 5892

35:6 And among the cities 5892 which ye shall give 5414-4 unto the Levites 3881 [there shall be] six 8337 cities 5892 for refuge, 4733 which ye shall appoint 5414-4 for the manslayer, 7523-6 that he may flee 5127-2 thither: and to them ye shall add 5414-4 forty 705 and two 8147 cities. 5892

35:7 [So] all the cities 5892 which ye shall give 5414-4 to the Levites 3881 [shall be] forty 705 and eight 8083 cities: 5892 them [shall ye give] with their suburbs. 4054

35:8 And the cities 5892 which ye shall give 5414-4 [shall be] of the possession 272 of the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 from [them that have] many 7227 ye shall give many; 7235-55 but from [them that have] few 4592 ye shall give few: 4591-55 every one 376 shall give 5414-4 of his cities 5892 unto the Levites 3881 according 6310 to his inheritance 5159 which he inheriteth. 5157-4

35:9 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 unto Moses, 4872 saying, 559-2

35:10 Speak 1696-16 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and say 559-1 unto them, When ye be come over 5674-6 Jordan 3383 into the land 776 of Canaan; 3667

35:11 Then ye shall appoint 7136-52 you cities 5892 to be cities 5892 of refuge 4733 for you; that the slayer 7523-6 may flee 5127-1 thither, which killeth 5221-56 any person 5315 at unawares. 7684

35:12 And they shall be unto you cities 5892 for refuge 4733 from the avenger; 1350-6 that the manslayer 7523-6 die 4191-4 not, until he stand 5975-2 before 6440 the congregation 5712 in judgment. 4941

35:13 And of these cities 5892 which ye shall give 5414-4 six 8337 cities 5892 shall ye have for refuge. 4733

35:14 Ye shall give 5414-4 three 7969 cities 5892 on this side 5676 Jordan, 3383 and three 7969 cities 5892 shall ye give 5414-4 in the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 [which] shall be cities 5892 of refuge. 4733

35:15 These six 8337 cities 5892 shall be a refuge, 4733 [both] for the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and for the stranger, 1616 and for the sojourner 8453 among 8432 them: that every one that killeth 5221-56 any person 5315 unawares 7684 may flee 5127-2 thither.

35:16 And if he smite 5221-52 him with an instrument 3627 of iron, 1270 so that he die, 4191-4 he [is] a murderer: 7523-6 the murderer 7523-6 shall surely 4191-2 be put to death. 4191-93

35:17 And if he smite 5221-52 him with throwing 3027 a stone, 68 wherewith he may die, 4191-4 and he die, 4191-4 he [is] a murderer: 7523-6 the murderer 7523-6 shall surely 4191-2 be put to death. 4191-93

35:18 Or [if] he smite 5221-52 him with an hand 3027 weapon 3627 of wood, 6086 wherewith he may die, 4191-4 and he die, 4191-4 he [is] a murderer: 7523-6 the murderer 7523-6 shall surely 4191-2 be put to death. 4191-93

35:19 The revenger 1350-6 of blood 1818 himself 1931 shall slay 4191-55 the murderer: 7523-6 when he meeteth 6293-2 him, he shall slay 4191-55 him.

35:20 But if he thrust 1920-4 him of hatred, 8135 or hurl 7993-52 at him by laying of wait, 6660 that he die; 4191-4

35:21 Or in enmity 342 smite 5221-52 him with his hand, 3027 that he die: 4191-4 he that smote 5221-56 [him] shall surely 4191-2 be put to death; 4191-93 [for] he [is] a murderer: 7523-6 the revenger 1350-6 of blood 1818 shall slay 4191-55 the murderer, 7523-6 when he meeteth 6293-2 him.

35:22 But if he thrust 1920-1 him suddenly 6621 without 3808 enmity, 342 or have cast 7993-52 upon him any thing 3627 without laying of wait, 6660

35:23 Or with any stone, 68 wherewith a man may die, 4191-4 seeing 7200-2 [him] not, 3808 and cast 5307-55 [it] upon him, that he die, 4191-4 and [was] not his enemy, 341-6 neither sought 1245-18 his harm: 7451

35:24 Then the congregation 5712 shall judge 8199-1 between the slayer 5221-56 and the revenger 1350-6 of blood 1818 according to these judgments: 4941

35:25 And the congregation 5712 shall deliver 5337-52 the slayer 7523-6 out of the hand 3027 of the revenger 1350-6 of blood, 1818 and the congregation 5712 shall restore 7725-52 him to the city 5892 of his refuge, 4733 whither he was fled: 5127-1 and he shall abide 3427-1 in it unto the death 4194 of the high 1419 priest, 3548 which was anointed 4886-1 with the holy 6944 oil. 8081

35:26 But if the slayer 7523-6 shall at any time 3318-2 come without 3318-4 the border 1366 of the city 5892 of his refuge, 4733 whither he was fled; 5127-4

35:27 And the revenger 1350-6 of blood 1818 find 4672-1 him without 2351 the borders 1366 of the city 5892 of his refuge, 4733 and the revenger 1350-6 of blood 1818 kill 7523-1 the slayer; 7523-6 he shall not be guilty of blood: 1818

35:28 Because he should have remained 3427-4 in the city 5892 of his refuge 4733 until the death 4194 of the high 1419 priest: 3548 but after 310 the death 4194 of the high 1419 priest 3548 the slayer 7523-6 shall return 7725-4 into the land 776 of his possession. 272

35:29 So these [things] shall be for a statute 2708 of judgment 4941 unto you throughout your generations 1755 in all your dwellings. 4186

35:30 Whoso killeth 5221-56 any person, 5315 the murderer 7523-6 shall be put to death 7523-4 by the mouth 6310 of witnesses: 5707 but one 259 witness 5707 shall not testify 6030-4 against any person 5315 [to cause him] to die. 4191-2

35:31 Moreover ye shall take 3947-4 no satisfaction 3724 for the life 5315 of a murderer, 7523-6 which [is] guilty 7563 of death: 4191-2 but he shall be surely 4191-2 put to death. 4191-93

35:32 And ye shall take 3947-4 no satisfaction 3724 for him that is fled 5127-2 to the city 5892 of his refuge, 4733 that he should come again 7725-2 to dwell 3427-2 in the land, 776 until the death 4194 of the priest. 3548

35:33 So ye shall not pollute 2610-55 the land 776 wherein ye [are]: for blood 1818 it defileth 2610-55 the land: 776 and the land 776 cannot be cleansed 3722-29 of the blood 1818 that is shed 8210-27 therein, but by the blood 1818 of him that shed 8210-6 it.

35:34 Defile 2930-17 not therefore the land 776 which ye shall inhabit, 3427-6 wherein 8432 I dwell: 7931-6 for I the LORD 3068 dwell 7931-6 among 8432 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

36:1 And the chief 7218 fathers 1 of the families 4940 of the children 1121 of Gilead, 1568 the son 1121 of Machir, 4353 the son 1121 of Manasseh, 4519 of the families 4940 of the sons 1121 of Joseph, 3130 came near, 7126-4 and spake 1696-17 before 6440 Moses, 4872 and before 6440 the princes, 5387 the chief 7218 fathers 1 of the children 1121 of Israel: 3478

36:2 And they said, 559-4 The LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 my lord 113 to give 5414-2 the land 776 for an inheritance 5159 by lot 1486 to the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 and my lord 113 was commanded 6680-27 by the LORD 3068 to give 5414-2 the inheritance 5159 of Zelophehad 6765 our brother 251 unto his daughters. 1323

36:3 And if they be married 802 to any 259 of the sons 1121 of the [other] tribes 7626 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 then shall their inheritance 5159 be taken 1639-8 from the inheritance 5159 of our fathers, 1 and shall be put 3254-8 to the inheritance 5159 of the tribe 4294 whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken 1639-11 from the lot 1486 of our inheritance. 5159

36:4 And when the jubile 3104 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 shall be, then shall their inheritance 5159 be put 3254-8 unto the inheritance 5159 of the tribe 4294 whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance 5159 be taken away 1639-11 from the inheritance 5159 of the tribe 4294 of our fathers. 1

36:5 And Moses 4872 commanded 6680-17 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 according to the word 6310 of the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 The tribe 4294 of the sons 1121 of Joseph 3130 hath said 1696-6 well.

36:6 This [is] the thing 1697 which the LORD 3068 doth command 6680-14 concerning the daughters 1323 of Zelophehad, 6765 saying, 559-2 Let them marry 802 to whom they think 5869 best; 2896 only to the family 4940 of the tribe 4294 of their father 1 shall they marry. 802

36:7 So shall not the inheritance 5159 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 remove 5437-11 from tribe 4294 to tribe: 4294 for every one 376 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 shall keep 1692-4 himself to the inheritance 5159 of the tribe 4294 of his fathers. 1

36:8 And every daughter, 1323 that possesseth 3423-6 an inheritance 5159 in any tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 shall be wife 802 unto one 259 of the family 4940 of the tribe 4294 of her father, 1 that the children 1121 of Israel 3478 may enjoy 3423-4 every man 376 the inheritance 5159 of his fathers. 1

36:9 Neither shall the inheritance 5159 remove 5437-11 from [one] tribe 4294 to another 312 tribe; 4294 but every one 376 of the tribes 4294 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 shall keep 1692-4 himself to his own inheritance. 5159

36:10 Even as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses, 4872 so did 6213-1 the daughters 1323 of Zelophehad: 6765

36:11 For Mahlah, 4244 Tirzah, 8656 and Hoglah, 2295 and Milcah, 4435 and Noah, 5270 the daughters 1323 of Zelophehad, 6765 were married 802 unto their father's brothers' 1730 sons: 1121

36:12 [And] they were married 802 into the families 4940 of the sons 1121 of Manasseh 4519 the son 1121 of Joseph, 3130 and their inheritance 5159 remained in the tribe 4294 of the family 4940 of their father. 1

36:13 These [are] the commandments 4687 and the judgments, 4941 which the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 by the hand 3027 of Moses 4872 unto the children 1121 of Israel 3478 in the plains 6160 of Moab 4124 by Jordan 3383 [near] Jericho. 3405
