1:1 Then Moab 4124 rebelled 6586-4 against Israel 3478 after 310 the death 4194 of Ahab. 256

1:2 And Ahaziah 274 fell down 5307-4 through a lattice 7639 in his upper chamber 5944 that [was] in Samaria, 8111 and was sick: 2470-4 and he sent 7971-4 messengers, 4397 and said 559-4 unto them, Go, 3212-3 enquire 1875-3 of Baalzebub 1176 the god 430 of Ekron 6138 whether I shall recover 2421-4 of this disease. 2483

1:3 But the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 said 1696-14 to Elijah 452 the Tishbite, 8664 Arise, 6965-3 go up 5927-3 to meet 7125-2 the messengers 4397 of the king 4428 of Samaria, 8111 and say 1696-16 unto them, [Is it] not because [there is] not a God 430 in Israel, 3478 [that] ye go 1980-6 to enquire 1875-2 of Baalzebub 1176 the god 430 of Ekron? 6138

1:4 Now therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Thou shalt not come down 3381-4 from that bed 4296 on which thou art gone up, 5927-1 but shalt surely 4191-2 die. 4191-4 And Elijah 452 departed. 3212-4

1:5 And when the messengers 4397 turned back 7725-4 unto him, he said 559-4 unto them, Why are ye now 2088 turned back? 7725-1

1:6 And they said 559-4 unto him, There came a man 376 up 5927-1 to meet 7125-2 us, and said 559-4 unto us, Go, 3212-3 turn again 7725-3 unto the king 4428 that sent 7971-1 you, and say 1696-14 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 [Is it] not because [there is] not a God 430 in Israel, 3478 [that] thou sendest 7971-6 to enquire 1875-2 of Baalzebub 1176 the god 430 of Ekron? 6138 therefore thou shalt not come down 3381-4 from that bed 4296 on which thou art gone up, 5927-1 but shalt surely 4191-2 die. 4191-4

1:7 And he said 1696-17 unto them, What manner 4941 of man 376 [was he] which came up 5927-1 to meet 7125-2 you, and told 1696-17 you these words? 1697

1:8 And they answered 559-4 him, [He was] an hairy 8181 man, 1167 376 and girt 247-7 with a girdle 232 of leather 5785 about his loins. 4975 And he said, 559-4 It [is] Elijah 452 the Tishbite. 8664

1:9 Then the king sent 7971-4 unto him a captain 8269 of fifty 2572 with his fifty. 2572 And he went up 5927-4 to him: and, behold, he sat 3427-6 on the top 7218 of an hill. 2022 And he spake 1696-17 unto him, Thou man 376 of God, 430 the king 4428 hath said, 1696-14 Come down. 3381-3

1:10 And Elijah 452 answered 6030-4 and said 1696-17 to the captain 8269 of fifty, 2572 If I [be] a man 376 of God, 430 then let fire 784 come down 3381-4 from heaven, 8064 and consume 398-4 thee and thy fifty. 2572 And there came down 3381-4 fire 784 from heaven, 8064 and consumed 398-4 him and his fifty. 2572

1:11 Again 7725-4 also he sent 7971-4 unto him another 312 captain 8269 of fifty 2572 with his fifty. 2572 And he answered 6030-4 and said 1696-17 unto him, O man 376 of God, 430 thus hath the king 4428 said, 559-1 Come down 3381-3 quickly. 4120

1:12 And Elijah 452 answered 6030-4 and said 1696-17 unto them, If I [be] a man 376 of God, 430 let fire 784 come down 3381-4 from heaven, 8064 and consume 398-4 thee and thy fifty. 2572 And the fire 784 of God 430 came down 3381-4 from heaven, 8064 and consumed 398-4 him and his fifty. 2572

1:13 And he sent 7971-4 again 7725-4 a captain 8269 of the third 7992 fifty 2572 with his fifty. 2572 And the third 7992 captain 8269 of fifty 2572 went up, 5927-4 and came 935-4 and fell 3766-4 on his knees 1290 before 5048 Elijah, 452 and besought 2603-101 him, and said 1696-17 unto him, O man 376 of God, 430 I pray thee, let my life, 5315 and the life 5315 of these fifty 2572 thy servants, 5650 be precious 3365-4 in thy sight. 5869

1:14 Behold, there came fire 784 down 3381-1 from heaven, 8064 and burnt up 398-4 the two 8147 captains 8269 of the former 7223 fifties 2572 with their fifties: 2572 therefore let my life 5315 now be precious 3365-4 in thy sight. 5869

1:15 And the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 said 1696-17 unto Elijah, 452 Go down 3381-3 with him: be not afraid 3372-4 of him. 6440 And he arose, 6965-4 and went down 3381-4 with him unto the king. 4428

1:16 And he said 1696-17 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Forasmuch as thou hast sent 7971-1 messengers 4397 to enquire 1875-2 of Baalzebub 1176 the god 430 of Ekron, 6138 [is it] not because [there is] no God 430 in Israel 3478 to enquire 1875-2 of his word? 1697 therefore thou shalt not come down 3381-4 off that bed 4296 on which thou art gone up, 5927-1 but shalt surely 4191-2 die. 4191-4

1:17 So he died 4191-4 according to the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 which Elijah 452 had spoken. 1696-14 And Jehoram 3088 reigned 4427-4 in his stead in the second 8147 year 8141 of Jehoram 3088 the son 1121 of Jehoshaphat 3092 king 4428 of Judah; 3063 because he had no son. 1121

1:18 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Ahaziah 274 which he did, 6213-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel? 3478

2:1 And it came to pass, when the LORD 3068 would take up 5927-53 Elijah 452 into heaven 8064 by a whirlwind, 5591 that Elijah 452 went 3212-4 with Elisha 477 from Gilgal. 1537

2:2 And Elijah 452 said 559-4 unto Elisha, 477 Tarry 3427-3 here, I pray thee; for the LORD 3068 hath sent 7971-1 me to Bethel. 1008 And Elisha 477 said 559-4 [unto him, As] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 and [as] thy soul 5315 liveth, 2416 I will not leave 5800-4 thee. So they went down 3381-4 to Bethel. 1008

2:3 And the sons 1121 of the prophets 5030 that [were] at Bethel 1008 came forth 3318-4 to Elisha, 477 and said 559-4 unto him, Knowest 3045-1 thou that the LORD 3068 will take away 3947-6 thy master 113 from thy head 7218 to day? 3117 And he said, 559-4 Yea, I know 3045-1 [it]; hold ye your peace. 2814-54

2:4 And Elijah 452 said 559-4 unto him, Elisha, 477 tarry 3427-3 here, I pray thee; for the LORD 3068 hath sent 7971-1 me to Jericho. 3405 And he said, 559-4 [As] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 and [as] thy soul 5315 liveth, 2416 I will not leave 5800-4 thee. So they came 935-4 to Jericho. 3405

2:5 And the sons 1121 of the prophets 5030 that [were] at Jericho 3405 came 5066-4 to Elisha, 477 and said 559-4 unto him, Knowest 3045-1 thou that the LORD 3068 will take away 3947-6 thy master 113 from thy head 7218 to day? 3117 And he answered, 559-4 Yea, I know 3045-1 [it]; hold ye your peace. 2814-54

2:6 And Elijah 452 said 559-4 unto him, Tarry, 3427-3 I pray thee, here; for the LORD 3068 hath sent 7971-1 me to Jordan. 3383 And he said, 559-4 [As] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 and [as] thy soul 5315 liveth, 2416 I will not leave 5800-4 thee. And they two 8147 went on. 3212-4

2:7 And fifty 2572 men 376 of the sons 1121 of the prophets 5030 went, 1980-1 and stood 5975-4 to view 5048 afar off: 7350 and they two 8147 stood 5975-1 by Jordan. 3383

2:8 And Elijah 452 took 3947-4 his mantle, 155 and wrapped [it] together, 1563-4 and smote 5221-55 the waters, 4325 and they were divided 2673-11 hither and thither, so that they two 8147 went over 5674-4 on dry ground. 2724

2:9 And it came to pass, when they were gone over, 5674-2 that Elijah 452 said 559-1 unto Elisha, 477 Ask 7592-3 what I shall do 6213-4 for thee, before I be taken away 3947-11 from thee. And Elisha 477 said, 559-4 I pray thee, let a double 8147 portion 6310 of thy spirit 7307 be upon me.

2:10 And he said, 559-4 Thou hast asked 7592-2 a hard thing: 7185-52 [nevertheless], if thou see 7200-4 me [when I am] taken 3947-27 from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be [so].

2:11 And it came to pass, as they still 1980-2 went on, 1980-6 and talked, 1696-15 that, behold, [there appeared] a chariot 7393 of fire, 784 and horses 5483 of fire, 784 and parted 6504-55 them both 8147 asunder; 996 and Elijah 452 went up 5927-4 by a whirlwind 5591 into heaven. 8064

2:12 And Elisha 477 saw 7200-6 [it], and he cried, 6817-18 My father, 1 my father, 1 the chariot 7393 of Israel, 3478 and the horsemen 6571 thereof. And he saw 7200-1 him no more: and he took hold 2388-55 of his own clothes, 899 and rent 7167-4 them in two 8147 pieces. 7168

2:13 He took up 7311-55 also the mantle 155 of Elijah 452 that fell 5307-1 from him, and went back, 7725-4 and stood 5975-4 by the bank 8193 of Jordan; 3383

2:14 And he took 3947-4 the mantle 155 of Elijah 452 that fell 5307-1 from him, and smote 5221-55 the waters, 4325 and said, 559-4 Where [is] the LORD 3068 God 430 of Elijah? 452 and when he also had smitten 5221-55 the waters, 4325 they parted 2673-11 hither and thither: and Elisha 477 went over. 5674-4

2:15 And when the sons 1121 of the prophets 5030 which [were] to view at Jericho 3405 saw 7200-4 him, they said, 559-4 The spirit 7307 of Elijah 452 doth rest 5117-1 on Elisha. 477 And they came 935-4 to meet 7125-2 him, and bowed 7812-101 themselves to the ground 776 before him.

2:16 And they said 559-4 unto him, Behold now, there be 3426 with thy servants 5650 fifty 2572 strong 2428 men; 1121 582 let them go, 3212-4 we pray thee, and seek 1245-17 thy master: 113 lest peradventure the Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 hath taken him up, 5375-1 and cast 7993-55 him upon some 259 mountain, 2022 or into some 259 valley. 1516 And he said, 559-4 Ye shall not send. 7971-4

2:17 And when they urged 6484-4 him till he was ashamed, 954-2 he said, 559-4 Send. 7971-3 They sent 7971-4 therefore fifty 2572 men; 376 and they sought 1245-17 three 7969 days, 3117 but found 4672-1 him not.

2:18 And when they came again 7725-4 to him, (for he tarried 3427-6 at Jericho,) 3405 he said 559-4 unto them, Did I not say 559-1 unto you, Go 3212-4 not?

2:19 And the men 582 of the city 5892 said 559-4 unto Elisha, 477 Behold, I pray thee, the situation 4186 of this city 5892 [is] pleasant, 2896 as my lord 113 seeth: 7200-6 but the water 4325 [is] naught, 7451 and the ground 776 barren. 7921-18

2:20 And he said, 559-4 Bring 3947-3 me a new 2319 cruse, 6746 and put 7760-3 salt 4417 therein. And they brought 3947-4 [it] to him.

2:21 And he went forth 3318-4 unto the spring 4161 of the waters, 4325 and cast 7993-55 the salt 4417 in there, and said, 559-4 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 I have healed 7495-14 these waters; 4325 there shall not be from thence any more death 4194 or barren 7921-18 [land].

2:22 So the waters 4325 were healed 7495-11 unto this day, 3117 according to the saying 1697 of Elisha 477 which he spake. 1696-14

2:23 And he went up 5927-4 from thence unto Bethel: 1008 and as he was going up 5927-6 by the way, 1870 there came forth 3318-1 little 6996 children 5288 out of the city, 5892 and mocked 7046-101 him, and said 559-4 unto him, Go up, 5927-3 thou bald head; 7142 go up, 5927-3 thou bald head. 7142

2:24 And he turned 6437-4 back, 310 and looked 7200-4 on them, and cursed 7043-17 them in the name 8034 of the LORD. 3068 And there came forth 3318-4 two 8147 she bears 1677 out of the wood, 3293 and tare 1234-17 forty 705 and two 8147 children 3206 of them.

2:25 And he went 3212-4 from thence to mount 2022 Carmel, 3760 and from thence he returned 7725-1 to Samaria. 8111

3:1 Now Jehoram 3088 the son 1121 of Ahab 256 began to reign 4427-1 over Israel 3478 in Samaria 8111 the eighteenth 8083 6240 year 8141 of Jehoshaphat 3092 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and reigned 4427-4 twelve 8147 6240 years. 8141

3:2 And he wrought 6213-4 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD; 3068 but not like his father, 1 and like his mother: 517 for he put away 5493-55 the image 4676 of Baal 1168 that his father 1 had made. 6213-1

3:3 Nevertheless he cleaved 1692-1 unto the sins 2403 of Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 which made Israel 3478 to sin; 2398-52 he departed 5493-1 not therefrom.

3:4 And Mesha 4338 king 4428 of Moab 4124 was a sheepmaster, 5349 and rendered 7725-52 unto the king 4428 of Israel 3478 an hundred 3967 thousand 505 lambs, 3733 and an hundred 3967 thousand 505 rams, 352 with the wool. 6785

3:5 But it came to pass, when Ahab 256 was dead, 4194 that the king 4428 of Moab 4124 rebelled 6586-4 against the king 4428 of Israel. 3478

3:6 And king 4428 Jehoram 3088 went out 3318-4 of Samaria 8111 the same time, 3117 and numbered 6485-4 all Israel. 3478

3:7 And he went 3212-4 and sent 7971-4 to Jehoshaphat 3092 the king 4428 of Judah, 3063 saying, 559-2 The king 4428 of Moab 4124 hath rebelled 6586-1 against me: wilt thou go 3212-4 with me against Moab 4124 to battle? 4421 And he said, 559-4 I will go up: 5927-4 I [am] as thou [art], my people 5971 as thy people, 5971 [and] my horses 5483 as thy horses. 5483

3:8 And he said, 559-4 Which way 1870 shall we go up? 5927-4 And he answered, 559-4 The way 1870 through the wilderness 4057 of Edom. 123

3:9 So the king 4428 of Israel 3478 went, 3212-4 and the king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and the king 4428 of Edom: 123 and they fetched a compass 5437-4 of seven 7651 days' 3117 journey: 1870 and there was no water 4325 for the host, 4264 and for the cattle 929 that followed 7272 them.

3:10 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 said, 559-4 Alas! 162 that the LORD 3068 hath called 7121-1 these three 7969 kings 4428 together, to deliver 5414-2 them into the hand 3027 of Moab! 4124

3:11 But Jehoshaphat 3092 said, 559-4 [Is there] not here a prophet 5030 of the LORD, 3068 that we may enquire 1875-4 of the LORD 3068 by him? And one 259 of the king 4428 of Israel's 3478 servants 5650 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 Here [is] Elisha 477 the son 1121 of Shaphat, 8202 which poured 3332-1 water 4325 on the hands 3027 of Elijah. 452

3:12 And Jehoshaphat 3092 said, 559-4 The word 1697 of the LORD 3068 is 3426 with him. So the king 4428 of Israel 3478 and Jehoshaphat 3092 and the king 4428 of Edom 123 went down 3381-4 to him.

3:13 And Elisha 477 said 559-4 unto the king 4428 of Israel, 3478 What have I to do with thee? get 3212-3 thee to the prophets 5030 of thy father, 1 and to the prophets 5030 of thy mother. 517 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto him, Nay: for the LORD 3068 hath called 7121-1 these three 7969 kings 4428 together, to deliver 5414-2 them into the hand 3027 of Moab. 4124

3:14 And Elisha 477 said, 559-4 [As] the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 liveth, 2416 before 6440 whom I stand, 5975-1 surely, were it not that 3884 I regard 5375-6 the presence 6440 of Jehoshaphat 3092 the king 4428 of Judah, 3063 I would not look 5027-55 toward thee, nor see 7200-4 thee.

3:15 But now bring 3947-3 me a minstrel. 5059-18 And it came to pass, when the minstrel 5059-18 played, 5059-15 that the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 came upon him.

3:16 And he said, 559-4 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Make 6213-2 this valley 5158 full of ditches. 1356

3:17 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Ye shall not see 7200-4 wind, 7307 neither shall ye see 7200-4 rain; 1653 yet that valley 5158 shall be filled 4390-11 with water, 4325 that ye may drink, 8354-1 both ye, and your cattle, 4735 and your beasts. 929

3:18 And this is [but] a light thing 7043-8 in the sight 5869 of the LORD: 3068 he will deliver 5414-1 the Moabites 4124 also into your hand. 3027

3:19 And ye shall smite 5221-52 every fenced 4013 city, 5892 and every choice 4004 city, 5892 and shall fell 5307-55 every good 2896 tree, 6086 and stop 5640-4 all wells 4599 of water, 4325 and mar 3510-55 every good 2896 piece 2513 of land with stones. 68

3:20 And it came to pass in the morning, 1242 when the meat offering 4503 was offered, 5927-2 that, behold, there came 935-6 water 4325 by the way 1870 of Edom, 123 and the country 776 was filled 4390-11 with water. 4325

3:21 And when all the Moabites 4124 heard 8085-1 that the kings 4428 were come up 5927-1 to fight 3898-9 against them, they gathered 6817-11 all that were able to put 2296-6 on armour, 2290 and upward, 4605 and stood 5975-4 in the border. 1366

3:22 And they rose up early 7925-55 in the morning, 1242 and the sun 8121 shone 2224-1 upon the water, 4325 and the Moabites 4124 saw 7200-4 the water 4325 on the other side 5048 [as] red 122 as blood: 1818

3:23 And they said, 559-4 This [is] blood: 1818 the kings 4428 are surely 2717-91 slain, 2717-8 and they have smitten 5221-55 one 376 another: 7453 now therefore, Moab, 4124 to the spoil. 7998

3:24 And when they came 935-4 to the camp 4264 of Israel, 3478 the Israelites 3478 rose up 6965-4 and smote 5221-55 the Moabites, 4124 so that they fled 5127-4 before 6440 them: but they went forward 5221-55 smiting 5221-53 the Moabites, 4124 even in [their] country.

3:25 And they beat down 2040-4 the cities, 5892 and on every good 2896 piece 2513 of land cast 7993-55 every man 376 his stone, 68 and filled 4390-14 it; and they stopped 5640-4 all the wells 4599 of water, 4325 and felled 5307-55 all the good 2896 trees: 6086 only in Kirharaseth 7025 left 7604-52 they the stones 68 thereof; howbeit the slingers 7051 went about 5437-4 [it], and smote 5221-55 it.

3:26 And when the king 4428 of Moab 4124 saw 7200-4 that the battle 4421 was too sore 2388-1 for him, he took 3947-4 with him seven 7651 hundred 3967 men 376 that drew 8025-6 swords, 2719 to break through 1234-53 [even] unto the king 4428 of Edom: 123 but they could 3201-1 not.

3:27 Then he took 3947-4 his eldest 1060 son 1121 that should have reigned 4427-4 in his stead, and offered 5927-55 him [for] a burnt offering 5930 upon the wall. 2346 And there was great 1419 indignation 7110 against Israel: 3478 and they departed 5265-4 from him, and returned 7725-4 to [their own] land. 776

4:1 Now there cried 6817-1 a certain 259 woman 802 of the wives 802 of the sons 1121 of the prophets 5030 unto Elisha, 477 saying, 559-2 Thy servant 5650 my husband 376 is dead; 4191-1 and thou knowest 3045-1 that thy servant 5650 did fear 3373 the LORD: 3068 and the creditor 5383-6 is come 935-1 to take 3947-2 unto him my two 8147 sons 3206 to be bondmen. 5650

4:2 And Elisha 477 said 559-4 unto her, What shall I do 6213-4 for thee? tell 5046-54 me, what hast 3426 thou in the house? 1004 And she said, 559-4 Thine handmaid 8198 hath not any thing in the house, 1004 save a pot 610 of oil. 8081

4:3 Then he said, 559-4 Go, 3212-3 borrow 7592-3 thee vessels 3627 abroad 2351 of all thy neighbours, 7934 [even] empty 7386 vessels; 3627 borrow not a few. 4591-55

4:4 And when thou art come in, 935-1 thou shalt shut 5462-1 the door 1817 upon thee and upon thy sons, 1121 and shalt pour 3332-1 out into all those vessels, 3627 and thou shalt set aside 5265-55 that which is full. 4392

4:5 So she went 3212-4 from him, and shut 5462-4 the door 1817 upon her 1157 and upon 1157 her sons, 1121 who 1992 brought 5066-56 [the vessels] to her; and she poured out. 3332-94

4:6 And it came to pass, when the vessels 3627 were full, 4390-2 that she said 559-4 unto her son, 1121 Bring 5066-54 me yet a vessel. 3627 And he said 559-4 unto her, [There is] not a vessel 3627 more. And the oil 8081 stayed. 5975-4

4:7 Then she came 935-4-k and told 5046-55 the man 376 of God. 430 And he said, 559-4 Go, 3212-3 sell 4376-3 the oil, 8081 and pay 7999-16 thy debt, 5386 and live 2421-4 thou and thy children 1121 of the rest. 3498-12

4:8 And it fell on a day, 3117 that Elisha 477 passed 5674-4 to Shunem, 7766 where [was] a great 1419 woman; 802 and she constrained 2388-55 him to eat 398-2 bread. 3899 And [so] it was, [that] as oft 1767 as he passed by, 5674-2 he turned in 5493-4 thither to eat 398-2 bread. 3899

4:9 And she said 559-4 unto her husband, 376 Behold now, I perceive 3045-1 that this [is] an holy 6918 man 376 of God, 430 which passeth by 5674-6 us continually. 8548

4:10 Let us make 6213-4 a little 6996 chamber, 5944 I pray thee, on the wall; 7023 and let us set 7760-4 for him there a bed, 4296 and a table, 7979 and a stool, 3678 and a candlestick: 4501 and it shall be, when he cometh 935-2 to us, that he shall turn in 5493-4 thither.

4:11 And it fell on a day, 3117 that he came 935-4 thither, and he turned 5493-4 into the chamber, 5944 and lay 7901-4 there.

4:12 And he said 559-4 to Gehazi 1522 his servant, 5288 Call 7121-3 this Shunammite. 7767 And when he had called 7121-4 her, she stood 5975-4 before 6440 him.

4:13 And he said 559-4 unto him, Say 559-3 now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful 2729-1 for us with all this care; 2731 what [is] to be done 6213-2 for thee? wouldest 3426 thou be spoken 1696-15 for to the king, 4428 or to the captain 8269 of the host? 6635 And she answered, 559-4 I dwell 3427-6 among 8432 mine own people. 5971

4:14 And he said, 559-4 What then [is] to be done 6213-2 for her? And Gehazi 1522 answered, 559-4 Verily 61 she hath no child, 1121 and her husband 376 is old. 2204-1

4:15 And he said, 559-4 Call 7121-3 her. And when he had called 7121-4 her, she stood 5975-4 in the door. 6607

4:16 And he said, 559-4 About this season, 4150 according to the time 6256 of life, 2416 thou shalt embrace 2263-6 a son. 1121 And she said, 559-4 Nay, my lord, 113 [thou] man 376 of God, 430 do not lie 3576-17 unto thine handmaid. 8198

4:17 And the woman 802 conceived, 2029-4 and bare 3205-4 a son 1121 at that season 4150 that Elisha 477 had said 1696-14 unto her, according to the time 6256 of life. 2416

4:18 And when the child 3206 was grown, 1431-4 it fell on a day, 3117 that he went out 3318-4 to his father 1 to the reapers. 7114-6

4:19 And he said 559-4 unto his father, 1 My head, 7218 my head. 7218 And he said 559-4 to a lad, 5288 Carry 5375-3 him to his mother. 517

4:20 And when he had taken 5375-4 him, and brought 935-55 him to his mother, 517 he sat 3427-4 on her knees 1290 till noon, 6672 and [then] died. 4191-4

4:21 And she went up, 5927-4 and laid 7901-55 him on the bed 4296 of the man 376 of God, 430 and shut 5462-4 [the door] upon him, and went out. 3318-4

4:22 And she called 7121-4 unto her husband, 376 and said, 559-4 Send 7971-3 me, I pray thee, one 259 of the young men, 5288 and one 259 of the asses, 860 that I may run 7323-4 to the man 376 of God, 430 and come again. 7725-4

4:23 And he said, 559-4 Wherefore wilt thou go 1980-6 to him to day? 3117 [it is] neither new moon, 2320 nor sabbath. 7676 And she said, 559-4 [It shall be] well. 7965

4:24 Then she saddled 2280-4 an ass, 860 and said 559-4 to her servant, 5288 Drive, 5090-3 and go 3212-3 forward; slack 6113-4 not [thy] riding 7392-2 for me, except I bid 559-1 thee.

4:25 So she went 3212-4 and came 935-4 unto the man 376 of God 430 to mount 2022 Carmel. 3760 And it came to pass, when the man 376 of God 430 saw 7200-2 her afar off, that he said 559-4 to Gehazi 1522 his servant, 5288 Behold, [yonder is] that 1975 Shunammite: 7767

4:26 Run 7323-3 now, I pray thee, to meet 7125-2 her, and say 559-3 unto her, [Is it] well 7965 with thee? [is it] well 7965 with thy husband? 376 [is it] well 7965 with the child? 3206 And she answered, 559-4 [It is] well. 7965

4:27 And when she came 935-4 to the man 376 of God 430 to the hill, 2022 she caught 2388-55 him by the feet: 7272 but Gehazi 1522 came near 5066-4 to thrust her away. 1920-2 And the man 376 of God 430 said, 559-4 Let her alone; 7503-54 for her soul 5315 [is] vexed 4843-1 within her: and the LORD 3068 hath hid 5956-52 [it] from me, and hath not told 5046-52 me.

4:28 Then she said, 559-4 Did I desire 7592-1 a son 1121 of my lord? 113 did I not say, 559-1 Do not deceive 7952-55 me?

4:29 Then he said 559-4 to Gehazi, 1522 Gird up 2296-3 thy loins, 4975 and take 3947-3 my staff 4938 in thine hand, 3027 and go 3212-3 thy way: if thou meet 4672-4 any man, 376 salute 1288-17 him not; and if any 376 salute 1288-17 thee, answer 6030-4 him not again: and lay 7760-1 my staff 4938 upon the face 6440 of the child. 5288

4:30 And the mother 517 of the child 5288 said, 559-4 [As] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 and [as] thy soul 5315 liveth, 2416 I will not leave 5800-4 thee. And he arose, 6965-4 and followed 3212-4 310 her.

4:31 And Gehazi 1522 passed on 5674-1 before 6440 them, and laid 7760-4 the staff 4938 upon the face 6440 of the child; 5288 but [there was] neither voice, 6963 nor hearing. 7182 Wherefore he went again 7725-4 to meet 7125-2 him, and told 5046-55 him, saying, 559-2 The child 5288 is not awaked. 6974-52

4:32 And when Elisha 477 was come 935-4 into the house, 1004 behold, the child 5288 was dead, 4191-5 [and] laid 7901-94 upon his bed. 4296

4:33 He went in 935-4 therefore, and shut 5462-4 the door 1817 upon them twain, 8147 and prayed 6419-101 unto the LORD. 3068

4:34 And he went up, 5927-4 and lay 7901-4 upon the child, 3206 and put 7760-4 his mouth 6310 upon his mouth, 6310 and his eyes 5869 upon his eyes, 5869 and his hands 3709 upon his hands: 3709 and he stretched 1457-4 himself upon the child; and the flesh 1320 of the child 3206 waxed warm. 2552-4

4:35 Then he returned, 7725-4 and walked 3212-4 in the house 1004 to 259 2008 and fro; 259 2008 and went up, 5927-4 and stretched 1457-4 himself upon him: and the child 5288 sneezed 2237-25 seven 7651 times, 6471 and the child 5288 opened 6491-4 his eyes. 5869

4:36 And he called 7121-4 Gehazi, 1522 and said, 559-4 Call 7121-3 this Shunammite. 7767 So he called 7121-4 her. And when she was come in 935-4 unto him, he said, 559-4 Take up 5375-3 thy son. 1121

4:37 Then she went in, 935-4 and fell 5307-4 at his feet, 7272 and bowed 7812-101 herself to the ground, 776 and took up 5375-4 her son, 1121 and went out. 3318-4

4:38 And Elisha 477 came again 7725-1 to Gilgal: 1537 and [there was] a dearth 7458 in the land; 776 and the sons 1121 of the prophets 5030 [were] sitting 3427-6 before 6440 him: and he said 559-4 unto his servant, 5288 Set 8239-3 on the great 1419 pot, 5518 and seethe 1310-16 pottage 5138 for the sons 1121 of the prophets. 5030

4:39 And one 259 went out 3318-4 into the field 7704 to gather 3950-15 herbs, 219 and found 4672-4 a wild 7704 vine, 1612 and gathered 3950-17 thereof wild 7704 gourds 6498 his lap 899 full, 4393 and came 935-4 and shred 6398-17 [them] into the pot 5518 of pottage: 5138 for they knew 3045-1 [them] not.

4:40 So they poured out 3332-4 for the men 582 to eat. 398-2 And it came to pass, as they were eating 398-2 of the pottage, 5138 that they cried out, 6817-1 and said, 559-4 O [thou] man 376 of God, 430 [there is] death 4194 in the pot. 5518 And they could 3201-1 not eat 398-2 [thereof].

4:41 But he said, 559-4 Then bring 3947-3 meal. 7058 And he cast 7993-55 [it] into the pot; 5518 and he said, 559-4 Pour 3332-3 out for the people, 5971 that they may eat. 398-4 And there was no harm 1697 7451 in the pot. 5518

4:42 And there came 935-6 a man 376 from Baalshalisha, 1190 and brought 935-55 the man 376 of God 430 bread 3899 of the firstfruits, 1061 twenty 6242 loaves 3899 of barley, 8184 and full ears of corn 3759 in the husk 6861 thereof. And he said, 559-4 Give 5414-3 unto the people, 5971 that they may eat. 398-4

4:43 And his servitor 8334-18 said, 559-4 What, should I set 5414-4 this before 6440 an hundred 3967 men? 376 He said 559-4 again, Give 5414-3 the people, 5971 that they may eat: 398-4 for thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 They shall eat, 398-2 and shall leave 3498-53 [thereof].

4:44 So he set 5414-4 [it] before 6440 them, and they did eat, 398-4 and left 3498-55 [thereof], according to the word 1697 of the LORD. 3068

5:1 Now Naaman, 5283 captain 8269 of the host 6635 of the king 4428 of Syria, 758 was a great 1419 man 376 with 6440 his master, 113 and honourable, 5375-7 6440 because by him the LORD 3068 had given 5414-1 deliverance 8668 unto Syria: 758 he was also a mighty 1368 man 376 in valour, 2428 [but he was] a leper. 6879-30

5:2 And the Syrians 758 had gone out 3318-1 by companies, 1416 and had brought away captive 7617-4 out of the land 776 of Israel 3478 a little 6996 maid; 5291 and she waited on 6440 Naaman's 5283 wife. 802

5:3 And she said 559-4 unto her mistress, 1404 Would God 305 my lord 113 [were] with 6440 the prophet 5030 that [is] in Samaria! 8111 for 227 he would recover 622-4 him of his leprosy. 6883

5:4 And [one] went in, 935-4 and told 5046-55 his lord, 113 saying, 559-2 Thus and thus said 1696-14 the maid 5291 that [is] of the land 776 of Israel. 3478

5:5 And the king 4428 of Syria 758 said, 559-4 Go to, 3212-3 go, 935-3 and I will send 7971-4 a letter 5612 unto the king 4428 of Israel. 3478 And he departed, 3212-4 and took 3947-4 with him 3027 ten 6235 talents 3603 of silver, 3701 and six 8337 thousand 505 [pieces] of gold, 2091 and ten 6235 changes 2487 of raiment. 899

5:6 And he brought 935-55 the letter 5612 to the king 4428 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 Now when this letter 5612 is come 935-2 unto thee, behold, I have [therewith] sent 7971-1 Naaman 5283 my servant 5650 to thee, that thou mayest recover 622-1 him of his leprosy. 6883

5:7 And it came to pass, when the king 4428 of Israel 3478 had read 7121-2 the letter, 5612 that he rent 7167-4 his clothes, 899 and said, 559-4 [Am] I God, 430 to kill 4191-53 and to make alive, 2421-53 that this man 2088 doth send 7971-6 unto me to recover 622-2 a man 376 of his leprosy? 6883 wherefore 389 consider, 3045-3 I pray you, and see 7200-3 how he seeketh a quarrel 579-102 against me.

5:8 And it was [so], when Elisha 477 the man 376 of God 430 had heard 8085-2 that the king 4428 of Israel 3478 had rent 7167-1 his clothes, 899 that he sent 7971-4 to the king, 4428 saying, 559-2 Wherefore hast thou rent 7167-1 thy clothes? 899 let him come 935-4 now to me, and he shall know 3045-4 that there is 3426 a prophet 5030 in Israel. 3478

5:9 So Naaman 5283 came 935-4 with his horses 5483 and with his chariot, 7393 and stood 5975-4 at the door 6607 of the house 1004 of Elisha. 477

5:10 And Elisha 477 sent 7971-4 a messenger 4397 unto him, saying, 559-2 Go 1980-2 and wash 7364-1 in Jordan 3383 seven 7651 times, 6471 and thy flesh 1320 shall come again 7725-4 to thee, and thou shalt be clean. 2891-3

5:11 But Naaman 5283 was wroth, 7107-4 and went away, 3212-4 and said, 559-4 Behold, I thought, 559-1 He will surely 3318-2 come out 3318-4 to me, and stand, 5975-1 and call 7121-1 on the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 his God, 430 and strike 5130-52 his hand 3027 over the place, 4725 and recover 622-1 the leper. 6879-30

5:12 [Are] not Abana 71|549-q and Pharpar, 6554 rivers 5104 of Damascus, 1834 better 2896 than all the waters 4325 of Israel? 3478 may I not wash 7364-4 in them, and be clean? 2891-1 So he turned 6437-4 and went away 3212-4 in a rage. 2534

5:13 And his servants 5650 came near, 5066-4 and spake 1696-17 unto him, and said, 559-4 My father, 1 [if] the prophet 5030 had bid 1696-14 thee [do some] great 1419 thing, 1697 wouldest thou not have done 6213-4 [it]? how much rather then, 637 when he saith 559-1 to thee, Wash, 7364-3 and be clean? 2891-3

5:14 Then went he down, 3381-4 and dipped 2881-4 himself seven 7651 times 6471 in Jordan, 3383 according to the saying 1697 of the man 376 of God: 430 and his flesh 1320 came again 7725-4 like unto the flesh 1320 of a little 6996 child, 5288 and he was clean. 2891-4

5:15 And he returned 7725-4 to the man 376 of God, 430 he and all his company, 4264 and came, 935-4 and stood 5975-4 before 6440 him: and he said, 559-4 Behold, now I know 3045-1 that [there is] no God 430 in all the earth, 776 but in Israel: 3478 now therefore, I pray thee, take 3947-3 a blessing 1293 of thy servant. 5650

5:16 But he said, 559-4 [As] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 before 6440 whom I stand, 5975-1 I will receive 3947-4 none. And he urged 6484-4 him to take 3947-2 [it]; but he refused. 3985-17

5:17 And Naaman 5283 said, 559-4 Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given 5414-93 to thy servant 5650 two 6776 mules' 6505 burden 4853 of earth? 127 for thy servant 5650 will henceforth offer 6213-4 neither burnt offering 5930 nor sacrifice 2077 unto other 312 gods, 430 but unto the LORD. 3068

5:18 In this thing 1697 the LORD 3068 pardon 5545-4 thy servant, 5650 [that] when my master 113 goeth 935-2 into the house 1004 of Rimmon 7417 to worship 7812-99 there, and he leaneth 8172-12 on my hand, 3027 and I bow 7812-98 myself in the house 1004 of Rimmon: 7417 when I bow down 7812-99 myself in the house 1004 of Rimmon, 7417 the LORD 3068 pardon 5545-4 thy servant 5650 in this thing. 1697

5:19 And he said 559-4 unto him, Go 3212-3 in peace. 7965 So he departed 3212-4 from him a little 3530 way. 776

5:20 But Gehazi, 1522 the servant 5288 of Elisha 477 the man 376 of God, 430 said, 559-4 Behold, my master 113 hath spared 2820-1 Naaman 5283 this Syrian, 761 in not receiving 3947-2 at his hands 3027 that which he brought: 935-52 but, [as] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 I will run 7323-1 after 310 him, and take 3947-1 somewhat 3972 of him.

5:21 So Gehazi 1522 followed 7291-4 after 310 Naaman. 5283 And when Naaman 5283 saw 7200-4 [him] running 7323-5 after 310 him, he lighted down 5307-4 from the chariot 4818 to meet 7125-2 him, and said, 559-4 [Is] all well? 7965

5:22 And he said, 559-4 All [is] well. 7965 My master 113 hath sent 7971-1 me, saying, 559-2 Behold, even now there be come 935-1 to me from mount 2022 Ephraim 669 two 8147 young men 5288 of the sons 1121 of the prophets: 5030 give 5414-3 them, I pray thee, a talent 3603 of silver, 3701 and two 8147 changes 2487 of garments. 899

5:23 And Naaman 5283 said, 559-4 Be content, 2974-54 take 3947-3 two talents. 3603 And he urged 6555-4 him, and bound 6696-4 two talents 3603 of silver 3701 in two 8147 bags, 2754 with two 8147 changes 2487 of garments, 899 and laid 5414-4 [them] upon two 8147 of his servants; 5288 and they bare 5375-4 [them] before 6440 him.

5:24 And when he came 935-4 to the tower, 6076 he took 3947-4 [them] from their hand, 3027 and bestowed 6485-4 [them] in the house: 1004 and he let the men 582 go, 7971-17 and they departed. 3212-4

5:25 But he went in, 935-6 and stood 5975-4 before his master. 113 And Elisha 477 said 559-4 unto him, Whence 370 [comest thou], Gehazi? 1522 And he said, 559-4 Thy servant 5650 went 1980-1 no whither. 575

5:26 And he said 559-4 unto him, Went 1980-1 not mine heart 3820 [with thee], when the man 376 turned 2015-1 again from his chariot 4818 to meet 7125-2 thee? [Is it] a time 6256 to receive 3947-2 money, 3701 and to receive 3947-2 garments, 899 and oliveyards, 2132 and vineyards, 3754 and sheep, 6629 and oxen, 1241 and menservants, 5650 and maidservants? 8198

5:27 The leprosy 6883 therefore of Naaman 5283 shall cleave 1692-4 unto thee, and unto thy seed 2233 for ever. 5769 And he went out 3318-4 from his presence 6440 a leper 6879-30 [as white] as snow. 7950

6:1 And the sons 1121 of the prophets 5030 said 559-4 unto Elisha, 477 Behold now, the place 4725 where we dwell 3427-6 with 6440 thee is too strait 6862 for us.

6:2 Let us go, 3212-4 we pray thee, unto Jordan, 3383 and take 3947-4 thence every man 376 a 259 beam, 6982 and let us make 6213-4 us a place 4725 there, where we may dwell. 3427-2 And he answered, 559-4 Go 3212-3 ye.

6:3 And one 259 said, 559-4 Be content, 2974-54 I pray thee, and go 3212-3 with thy servants. 5650 And he answered, 559-4 I will go. 3212-4

6:4 So he went 3212-4 with them. And when they came 935-4 to Jordan, 3383 they cut down 1504-4 wood. 6086

6:5 But as one 259 was felling 5307-56 a beam, 6982 the axe head 1270 fell 5307-1 into the water: 4325 and he cried, 6817-4 and said, 559-4 Alas, 162 master! 113 for it was borrowed. 7592-7

6:6 And the man 376 of God 430 said, 559-4 Where 575 fell 5307-1 it? And he shewed 7200-55 him the place. 4725 And he cut down 7094-4 a stick, 6086 and cast 7993-55 [it] in thither; and the iron 1270 did swim. 6687-55

6:7 Therefore said 559-4 he, Take [it] up 7311-54 to thee. And he put out 7971-4 his hand, 3027 and took 3947-4 it.

6:8 Then the king 4428 of Syria 758 warred 3898-12 against Israel, 3478 and took counsel 3289-11 with his servants, 5650 saying, 559-2 In such 6423 and such 492 a place 4725 [shall be] my camp. 8466

6:9 And the man 376 of God 430 sent 7971-4 unto the king 4428 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 Beware 8104-10 that thou pass 5674-2 not such 2088 a place; 4725 for thither the Syrians 758 are come down. 5185

6:10 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 sent 7971-4 to the place 4725 which the man 376 of God 430 told 559-1 him and warned 2094-52 him of, and saved 8104-8 himself there, not once 259 nor twice. 8147

6:11 Therefore the heart 3820 of the king 4428 of Syria 758 was sore troubled 5590-11 for this thing; 1697 and he called 7121-4 his servants, 5650 and said 559-4 unto them, Will ye not shew 5046-55 me which of us [is] for the king 4428 of Israel? 3478

6:12 And one 259 of his servants 5650 said, 559-4 None, my lord, 113 O king: 4428 but Elisha, 477 the prophet 5030 that [is] in Israel, 3478 telleth 5046-55 the king 4428 of Israel 3478 the words 1697 that thou speakest 1696-17 in thy bedchamber. 2315 4904

6:13 And he said, 559-4 Go 3212-3 and spy 7200-3 where 351 he [is], that I may send 7971-4 and fetch 3947-4 him. And it was told 5046-93 him, saying, 559-2 Behold, [he is] in Dothan. 1886

6:14 Therefore sent 7971-4 he thither horses, 5483 and chariots, 7393 and a great 3515 host: 2428 and they came 935-4 by night, 3915 and compassed 5362-55 the city 5892 about.

6:15 And when the servant 8334-18 of the man 376 of God 430 was risen 6965-2 early, 7925-55 and gone forth, 3318-4 behold, an host 2428 compassed 5437-6 the city 5892 both with horses 5483 and chariots. 7393 And his servant 5288 said 559-4 unto him, Alas, 162 my master! 113 how shall we do? 6213-4

6:16 And he answered, 559-4 Fear 3372-4 not: for they that [be] with us [are] more 7227 than they that [be] with them.

6:17 And Elisha 477 prayed, 6419-101 and said, 559-4 LORD, 3068 I pray thee, open 6491-3 his eyes, 5869 that he may see. 7200-4 And the LORD 3068 opened 6491-4 the eyes 5869 of the young man; 5288 and he saw: 7200-4 and, behold, the mountain 2022 [was] full 4390-1 of horses 5483 and chariots 7393 of fire 784 round about 5439 Elisha. 477

6:18 And when they came down 3381-4 to him, Elisha 477 prayed 6419-101 unto the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 Smite 5221-54 this people, 1471 I pray thee, with blindness. 5575 And he smote 5221-55 them with blindness 5575 according to the word 1697 of Elisha. 477

6:19 And Elisha 477 said 559-4 unto them, This [is] not the way, 1870 neither [is] this 2090 the city: 5892 follow 3212-3 310 me, and I will bring 3212-55 you to the man 376 whom ye seek. 1245-17 But he led 3212-55 them to Samaria. 8111

6:20 And it came to pass, when they were come 935-2 into Samaria, 8111 that Elisha 477 said, 559-4 LORD, 3068 open 6491-3 the eyes 5869 of these [men], that they may see. 7200-4 And the LORD 3068 opened 6491-4 their eyes, 5869 and they saw; 7200-4 and, behold, [they were] in the midst 8432 of Samaria. 8111

6:21 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto Elisha, 477 when he saw 7200-2 them, My father, 1 shall I smite 5221-55 [them]? shall I smite 5221-55 [them]?

6:22 And he answered, 559-4 Thou shalt not smite 5221-55 [them]: wouldest thou smite 5221-56 those whom thou hast taken captive 7617-1 with thy sword 2719 and with thy bow? 7198 set 7760-3 bread 3899 and water 4325 before 6440 them, that they may eat 398-4 and drink, 8354-4 and go 3212-4 to their master. 113

6:23 And he prepared 3739-4 great 1419 provision 3740 for them: and when they had eaten 398-4 and drunk, 8354-4 he sent them away, 7971-17 and they went 3212-4 to their master. 113 So the bands 1416 of Syria 758 came 935-2 no more 3254-1 into the land 776 of Israel. 3478

6:24 And it came to pass after 310 this, that Benhadad 1130 king 4428 of Syria 758 gathered 6908-4 all his host, 4264 and went up, 5927-4 and besieged 6696-4 Samaria. 8111

6:25 And there was a great 1419 famine 7458 in Samaria: 8111 and, behold, they besieged 6696-6 it, until an ass's 2543 head 7218 was [sold] for fourscore 8084 [pieces] of silver, 3701 and the fourth 7255 part of a cab 6894 of dove's 3123 dung 1686|3123-k|2755-k for five 2568 [pieces] of silver. 3701

6:26 And as the king 4428 of Israel 3478 was passing 5674-6 by upon the wall, 2346 there cried 6817-1 a woman 802 unto him, saying, 559-2 Help, 3467-54 my lord, 113 O king. 4428

6:27 And he said, 559-4 If the LORD 3068 do not help 3467-55 thee, whence 370 shall I help 3467-55 thee? out of the barnfloor, 1637 or out of the winepress? 3342

6:28 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, 559-4 This woman 802 said 559-1 unto me, Give 5414-3 thy son, 1121 that we may eat 398-4 him to day, 3117 and we will eat 398-4 my son 1121 to morrow. 4279

6:29 So we boiled 1310-17 my son, 1121 and did eat 398-4 him: and I said 559-4 unto her on the next 312 day, 3117 Give 5414-3 thy son, 1121 that we may eat 398-4 him: and she hath hid 2244-55 her son. 1121

6:30 And it came to pass, when the king 4428 heard 8085-2 the words 1697 of the woman, 802 that he rent 7167-4 his clothes; 899 and he passed by 5674-6 upon the wall, 2346 and the people 5971 looked, 7200-4 and, behold, [he had] sackcloth 8242 within 1004 upon his flesh. 1320

6:31 Then he said, 559-4 God 430 do 6213-4 so and more 3254-55 also to me, if the head 7218 of Elisha 477 the son 1121 of Shaphat 8202 shall stand 5975-4 on him this day. 3117

6:32 But Elisha 477 sat 3427-6 in his house, 1004 and the elders 2205 sat 3427-6 with him; and [the king] sent 7971-4 a man 376 from before 6440 him: but ere the messenger 4397 came 935-4 to him, he said 559-1 to the elders, 2205 See 7200-1 ye how this son 1121 of a murderer 7523-18 hath sent 7971-1 to take away 5493-53 mine head? 7218 look, 7200-3 when the messenger 4397 cometh, 935-2 shut 5462-3 the door, 1817 and hold him fast 3905-1 at the door: 1817 [is] not the sound 6963 of his master's 113 feet 7272 behind 310 him?

6:33 And while he yet talked 1696-18 with them, behold, the messenger 4397 came down 3381-6 unto him: and he said, 559-4 Behold, this evil 7451 [is] of the LORD; 3068 what should I wait 3176-55 for the LORD 3068 any longer?

7:1 Then Elisha 477 said, 559-4 Hear 8085-3 ye the word 1697 of the LORD; 3068 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 To morrow 4279 about this time 6256 [shall] a measure 5429 of fine flour 5560 [be sold] for a shekel, 8255 and two measures 5429 of barley 8184 for a shekel, 8255 in the gate 8179 of Samaria. 8111

7:2 Then a lord 7991 on whose hand 3027 the king 4428 leaned 8172-12 answered 6030-4 the man 376 of God, 430 and said, 559-4 Behold, [if] the LORD 3068 would make 6213-6 windows 699 in heaven, 8064 might this thing 1697 be? And he said, 559-4 Behold, thou shalt see 7200-6 [it] with thine eyes, 5869 but shalt not eat 398-4 thereof.

7:3 And there were four 702 leprous 6879-30 men 582 at the entering in 6607 of the gate: 8179 and they said 559-4 one 376 to another, 7453 Why sit 3427-6 we here until we die? 4191-1

7:4 If we say, 559-1 We will enter 935-4 into the city, 5892 then the famine 7458 [is] in the city, 5892 and we shall die 4191-1 there: and if we sit still 3427-1 here, we die 4191-1 also. Now therefore come, 3212-3 and let us fall 5307-4 unto the host 4264 of the Syrians: 758 if they save us alive, 2421-17 we shall live; 2421-4 and if they kill 4191-55 us, we shall but die. 4191-1

7:5 And they rose up 6965-4 in the twilight, 5399 to go 935-2 unto the camp 4264 of the Syrians: 758 and when they were come 935-4 to the uttermost part 7097 of the camp 4264 of Syria, 758 behold, [there was] no man 376 there.

7:6 For the Lord 136 had made the host 4264 of the Syrians 758 to hear 8085-52 a noise 6963 of chariots, 7393 and a noise 6963 of horses, 5483 [even] the noise 6963 of a great 1419 host: 2428 and they said 559-4 one 376 to another, 251 Lo, the king 4428 of Israel 3478 hath hired 7936-1 against us the kings 4428 of the Hittites, 2850 and the kings 4428 of the Egyptians, 4714 to come 935-2 upon us.

7:7 Wherefore they arose 6965-4 and fled 5127-4 in the twilight, 5399 and left 5800-4 their tents, 168 and their horses, 5483 and their asses, 2543 even the camp 4264 as it [was], and fled 5127-4 for their life. 5315

7:8 And when these lepers 6879-30 came 935-4 to the uttermost part 7097 of the camp, 4264 they went 935-4 into one 259 tent, 168 and did eat 398-4 and drink, 8354-4 and carried 5375-4 thence silver, 3701 and gold, 2091 and raiment, 899 and went 3212-4 and hid 2934-55 [it]; and came again, 7725-4 and entered 935-4 into another 312 tent, 168 and carried 5375-4 thence [also], and went 3212-4 and hid 2934-55 [it].

7:9 Then they said 559-4 one 376 to another, 7453 We do 6213-6 not well: this day 3117 [is] a day 3117 of good tidings, 1309 and we hold our peace: 2814-56 if we tarry 2442-14 till the morning 1242 light, 216 some mischief 5771 will come upon 4672-1 us: now therefore come, 3212-3 that we may go 935-4 and tell 5046-55 the king's 4428 household. 1004

7:10 So they came 935-4 and called 7121-4 unto the porter 7778 of the city: 5892 and they told 5046-55 them, saying, 559-2 We came 935-1 to the camp 4264 of the Syrians, 758 and, behold, [there was] no man 376 there, neither voice 6963 of man, 120 but horses 5483 tied, 631-7 and asses 2543 tied, 631-7 and the tents 168 as they [were].

7:11 And he called 7121-4 the porters; 7778 and they told 5046-55 [it] to the king's 4428 house 1004 within. 6441

7:12 And the king 4428 arose 6965-4 in the night, 3915 and said 559-4 unto his servants, 5650 I will now shew 5046-55 you what the Syrians 758 have done 6213-1 to us. They know 3045-1 that we [be] hungry; 7457 therefore are they gone out 3318-4 of the camp 4264 to hide 2247-9 themselves in the field, 7704 saying, 559-2 When they come out 3318-4 of the city, 5892 we shall catch 8610-4 them alive, 2416 and get 935-4 into the city. 5892

7:13 And one 259 of his servants 5650 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 Let [some] take, 3947-4 I pray thee, five 2568 of the horses 5483 that remain, 7604-12 which are left 7604-8 in the city, (behold, they [are] as all the multitude 1995 of Israel 3478 that are left 7604-8 in it: behold, [I say], they [are] even as all the multitude 1995 of the Israelites 3478 that are consumed:) 8552-1 and let us send 7971-4 and see. 7200-4

7:14 They took 3947-4 therefore two 8147 chariot 7393 horses; 5483 and the king 4428 sent 7971-4 after 310 the host 4264 of the Syrians, 758 saying, 559-2 Go 3212-3 and see. 7200-3

7:15 And they went 3212-4 after 310 them unto Jordan: 3383 and, lo, all the way 1870 [was] full 4392 of garments 899 and vessels, 3627 which the Syrians 758 had cast away 7993-52 in their haste. 2648-2 And the messengers 4397 returned, 7725-4 and told 5046-55 the king. 4428

7:16 And the people 5971 went out, 3318-4 and spoiled 962-4 the tents 4264 of the Syrians. 758 So a measure 5429 of fine flour 5560 was [sold] for a shekel, 8255 and two measures 5429 of barley 8184 for a shekel, 8255 according to the word 1697 of the LORD. 3068

7:17 And the king 4428 appointed 6485-52 the lord 7991 on whose hand 3027 he leaned 8172-12 to have the charge of the gate: 8179 and the people 5971 trode 7429-4 upon him in the gate, 8179 and he died, 4191-4 as the man 376 of God 430 had said, 1696-14 who spake 1696-14 when the king 4428 came down 3381-2 to him.

7:18 And it came to pass as the man 376 of God 430 had spoken 1696-15 to the king, 4428 saying, 559-2 Two measures 5429 of barley 8184 for a shekel, 8255 and a measure 5429 of fine flour 5560 for a shekel, 8255 shall be to morrow 4279 about this time 6256 in the gate 8179 of Samaria: 8111

7:19 And that lord 7991 answered 6030-4 the man 376 of God, 430 and said, 559-4 Now, behold, [if] the LORD 3068 should make 6213-6 windows 699 in heaven, 8064 might such a thing 1697 be? And he said, 559-4 Behold, thou shalt see 7200-6 it with thine eyes, 5869 but shalt not eat 398-4 thereof.

7:20 And so it fell out unto him: for the people 5971 trode 7429-4 upon him in the gate, 8179 and he died. 4191-4

8:1 Then spake 1696-14 Elisha 477 unto the woman, 802 whose son 1121 he had restored to life, 2421-52 saying, 559-2 Arise, 6965-3 and go 3212-3 thou and thine household, 1004 and sojourn 1481-3 wheresoever 834 thou canst sojourn: 1481-4 for the LORD 3068 hath called 7121-1 for a famine; 7458 and it shall also come 935-1 upon the land 776 seven 7651 years. 8141

8:2 And the woman 802 arose, 6965-4 and did 6213-4 after the saying 1697 of the man 376 of God: 430 and she went 3212-4 with her household, 1004 and sojourned 1481-4 in the land 776 of the Philistines 6430 seven 7651 years. 8141

8:3 And it came to pass at the seven 7651 years' 8141 end, 7097 that the woman 802 returned 7725-4 out of the land 776 of the Philistines: 6430 and she went forth 3318-4 to cry 6817-2 unto the king 4428 for her house 1004 and for her land. 7704

8:4 And the king 4428 talked 1696-18 with Gehazi 1522 the servant 5288 of the man 376 of God, 430 saying, 559-2 Tell 5608-16 me, I pray thee, all the great things 1419 that Elisha 477 hath done. 6213-1

8:5 And it came to pass, as he was telling 5608-18 the king 4428 how he had restored a dead 4191-5 body to life, 2421-52 that, behold, the woman, 802 whose son 1121 he had restored to life, 2421-52 cried 6817-6 to the king 4428 for her house 1004 and for her land. 7704 And Gehazi 1522 said, 559-4 My lord, 113 O king, 4428 this [is] the woman, 802 and this [is] her son, 1121 whom Elisha 477 restored to life. 2421-52

8:6 And when the king 4428 asked 7592-4 the woman, 802 she told 5608-17 him. So the king 4428 appointed 5414-4 unto her a certain 259 officer, 5631 saying, 559-2 Restore 7725-54 all that [was] hers, and all the fruits 8393 of the field 7704 since the day 3117 that she left 5800-2 the land, 776 even until now.

8:7 And Elisha 477 came 935-4 to Damascus; 1834 and Benhadad 1130 the king 4428 of Syria 758 was sick; 2470-6 and it was told 5046-93 him, saying, 559-2 The man 376 of God 430 is come 935-1 hither. 2008

8:8 And the king 4428 said 559-4 unto Hazael, 2371 Take 3947-3 a present 4503 in thine hand, 3027 and go, 3212-3 meet 7125-2 the man 376 of God, 430 and enquire 1875-1 of the LORD 3068 by him, saying, 559-2 Shall I recover 2421-4 of this disease? 2483

8:9 So Hazael 2371 went 3212-4 to meet 7125-2 him, and took 3947-4 a present 4503 with him, 3027 even of every good thing 2898 of Damascus, 1834 forty 705 camels' 1581 burden, 4853 and came 935-4 and stood 5975-4 before 6440 him, and said, 559-4 Thy son 1121 Benhadad 1130 king 4428 of Syria 758 hath sent 7971-1 me to thee, saying, 559-2 Shall I recover 2421-4 of this disease? 2483

8:10 And Elisha 477 said 559-4 unto him, Go, 3212-3 say 559-3 unto him, Thou mayest certainly 2421-2 recover: 2421-4 howbeit the LORD 3068 hath shewed 7200-52 me that he shall surely 4191-2 die. 4191-4

8:11 And he settled 5975-55 his countenance 6440 stedfastly, 7760-4 until he was ashamed: 954-2 and the man 376 of God 430 wept. 1058-4

8:12 And Hazael 2371 said, 559-4 Why weepeth 1058-6 my lord? 113 And he answered, 559-4 Because I know 3045-1 the evil 7451 that thou wilt do 6213-4 unto the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 their strong holds 4013 wilt thou set 7971-17 on fire, 784 and their young men 970 wilt thou slay 2026-4 with the sword, 2719 and wilt dash 7376-17 their children, 5768 and rip up 1234-17 their women with child. 2030

8:13 And Hazael 2371 said, 559-4 But what, [is] thy servant 5650 a dog, 3611 that he should do 6213-4 this great 1419 thing? 1697 And Elisha 477 answered, 559-4 The LORD 3068 hath shewed 7200-52 me that thou [shalt be] king 4428 over Syria. 758

8:14 So he departed 3212-4 from Elisha, 477 and came 935-4 to his master; 113 who said 559-4 to him, What said 559-1 Elisha 477 to thee? And he answered, 559-4 He told 559-1 me [that] thou shouldest surely 2421-2 recover. 2421-4

8:15 And it came to pass on the morrow, 4283 that he took 3947-4 a thick cloth, 4346 and dipped 2881-4 [it] in water, 4325 and spread 6566-4 [it] on his face, 6440 so that he died: 4191-4 and Hazael 2371 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

8:16 And in the fifth 2568 year 8141 of Joram 3141 the son 1121 of Ahab 256 king 4428 of Israel, 3478 Jehoshaphat 3092 [being] then king 4428 of Judah, 3063 Jehoram 3088 the son 1121 of Jehoshaphat 3092 king 4428 of Judah 3063 began to reign. 4427-1

8:17 Thirty 7970 and two 8147 years 8141 old 1121 was he when he began to reign; 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 eight 8083 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389

8:18 And he walked 3212-4 in the way 1870 of the kings 4428 of Israel, 3478 as did 6213-1 the house 1004 of Ahab: 256 for the daughter 1323 of Ahab 256 was his wife: 802 and he did 6213-4 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD. 3068

8:19 Yet the LORD 3068 would 14-1 not destroy 7843-53 Judah 3063 for David 1732 his servant's 5650 sake, as he promised 559-1 him to give 5414-2 him alway 3605 3117 a light, 5216 [and] to his children. 1121

8:20 In his days 3117 Edom 123 revolted 6586-1 from under the hand 3027 of Judah, 3063 and made 4427-55 a king 4428 over themselves.

8:21 So Joram 3141 went over 5674-4 to Zair, 6811 and all the chariots 7393 with him: and he rose 6965-1 by night, 3915 and smote 5221-55 the Edomites 123 which compassed 5437-6 him about, and the captains 8269 of the chariots: 7393 and the people 5971 fled 5127-4 into their tents. 168

8:22 Yet Edom 123 revolted 6586-4 from under the hand 3027 of Judah 3063 unto this day. 3117 Then Libnah 3841 revolted 6586-4 at the same 1931 time. 6256

8:23 And the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Joram, 3141 and all that he did, 6213-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Judah? 3063

8:24 And Joram 3141 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and was buried 6912-11 with his fathers 1 in the city 5892 of David: 1732 and Ahaziah 274 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

8:25 In the 8141 twelfth 8147 6240 year 8141 of Joram 3141 the son 1121 of Ahab 256 king 4428 of Israel 3478 did Ahaziah 274 the son 1121 of Jehoram 3088 king 4428 of Judah 3063 begin to reign. 4427-1

8:26 Two 8147 and twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 [was] Ahaziah 274 when he began to reign; 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 one 259 year 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Athaliah, 6271 the daughter 1323 of Omri 6018 king 4428 of Israel. 3478

8:27 And he walked 3212-4 in the way 1870 of the house 1004 of Ahab, 256 and did 6213-4 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 as [did] the house 1004 of Ahab: 256 for he [was] the son in law 2860 of the house 1004 of Ahab. 256

8:28 And he went 3212-4 with Joram 3141 the son 1121 of Ahab 256 to the war 4421 against Hazael 2371 king 4428 of Syria 758 in Ramothgilead; 7433 1568 and the Syrians 761 wounded 5221-55 Joram. 3141

8:29 And king 4428 Joram 3141 went back 7725-4 to be healed 7495-99 in Jezreel 3157 of the wounds 4347 which the Syrians 761 had given 5221-55 him at Ramah, 7414 when he fought 3898-9 against Hazael 2371 king 4428 of Syria. 758 And Ahaziah 274 the son 1121 of Jehoram 3088 king 4428 of Judah 3063 went down 3381-1 to see 7200-2 Joram 3141 the son 1121 of Ahab 256 in Jezreel, 3157 because he was sick. 2470-6

9:1 And Elisha 477 the prophet 5030 called 7121-1 one 259 of the children 1121 of the prophets, 5030 and said 559-4 unto him, Gird up 2296-3 thy loins, 4975 and take 3947-3 this box 6378 of oil 8081 in thine hand, 3027 and go 3212-3 to Ramothgilead: 7433 1568

9:2 And when thou comest 935-1 thither, look out 7200-3 there Jehu 3058 the son 1121 of Jehoshaphat 3092 the son 1121 of Nimshi, 5250 and go in, 935-1 and make him arise up 6965-52 from among 8432 his brethren, 251 and carry 935-52 him to an inner 2315 chamber; 2315

9:3 Then take 3947-1 the box 6378 of oil, 8081 and pour 3332-1 [it] on his head, 7218 and say, 559-1 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 I have anointed 4886-1 thee king 4428 over Israel. 3478 Then open 6605-1 the door, 1817 and flee, 5127-1 and tarry 2442-17 not.

9:4 So the young man, 5288 [even] the young man 5288 the prophet, 5030 went 3212-4 to Ramothgilead. 7433 1568

9:5 And when he came, 935-4 behold, the captains 8269 of the host 2428 [were] sitting; 3427-6 and he said, 559-4 I have an errand 1697 to thee, O captain. 8269 And Jehu 3058 said, 559-4 Unto which of all us? And he said, 559-4 To thee, O captain. 8269

9:6 And he arose, 6965-4 and went 935-4 into the house; 1004 and he poured 3332-4 the oil 8081 on his head, 7218 and said 559-4 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 I have anointed 4886-1 thee king 4428 over the people 5971 of the LORD, 3068 [even] over Israel. 3478

9:7 And thou shalt smite 5221-52 the house 1004 of Ahab 256 thy master, 113 that I may avenge 5358-14 the blood 1818 of my servants 5650 the prophets, 5030 and the blood 1818 of all the servants 5650 of the LORD, 3068 at the hand 3027 of Jezebel. 348

9:8 For the whole house 1004 of Ahab 256 shall perish: 6-1 and I will cut off 3772-52 from Ahab 256 him that pisseth 8366-56 against the wall, 7023 and him that is shut up 6113-7 and left 5800-7 in Israel: 3478

9:9 And I will make 5414-1 the house 1004 of Ahab 256 like the house 1004 of Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 and like the house 1004 of Baasha 1201 the son 1121 of Ahijah: 281

9:10 And the dogs 3611 shall eat 398-4 Jezebel 348 in the portion 2506 of Jezreel, 3157 and [there shall be] none to bury 6912-6 [her]. And he opened 6605-4 the door, 1817 and fled. 5127-4

9:11 Then Jehu 3058 came forth 3318-1 to the servants 5650 of his lord: 113 and [one] said 559-4 unto him, [Is] all well? 7965 wherefore came 935-1 this mad 7696-30 [fellow] to thee? And he said 559-4 unto them, Ye know 3045-1 the man, 376 and his communication. 7879

9:12 And they said, 559-4 [It is] false; 8267 tell 5046-54 us now. And he said, 559-4 Thus and thus spake 559-1 he to me, saying, 559-2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 I have anointed 4886-1 thee king 4428 over Israel. 3478

9:13 Then they hasted, 4116-17 and took 3947-4 every man 376 his garment, 899 and put 7760-4 [it] under him on the top 1634 of the stairs, 4609 and blew 8628-4 with trumpets, 7782 saying, 559-4 Jehu 3058 is king. 4427-1

9:14 So Jehu 3058 the son 1121 of Jehoshaphat 3092 the son 1121 of Nimshi 5250 conspired 7194-101 against Joram. 3141 (Now Joram 3141 had kept 8104-6 Ramothgilead, 7433 1568 he and all Israel, 3478 because 6440 of Hazael 2371 king 4428 of Syria. 758

9:15 But king 4428 Joram 3088 was returned 7725-4 to be healed 7495-99 in Jezreel 3157 of the wounds 4347 which the Syrians 761 had given 5221-55 him, when he fought 3898-9 with Hazael 2371 king 4428 of Syria.) 758 And Jehu 3058 said, 559-4 If it be 3426 your minds, 5315 [then] let none 408 go forth 3318-4 [nor] escape 6412 out of the city 5892 to go 3212-2 to tell 5046-53 [it] in Jezreel. 3157

9:16 So Jehu 3058 rode 7392-4 in a chariot, and went 3212-4 to Jezreel; 3157 for Joram 3141 lay 7901-6 there. And Ahaziah 274 king 4428 of Judah 3063 was come down 3381-1 to see 7200-2 Joram. 3141

9:17 And there stood 5975-6 a watchman 6822-6 on the tower 4026 in Jezreel, 3157 and he spied 7200-4 the company 8229 of Jehu 3058 as he came, 935-2 and said, 559-4 I see 7200-6 a company. 8229 And Joram 3088 said, 559-4 Take 3947-3 an horseman, 7395 and send 7971-3 to meet 7125-2 them, and let him say, 559-4 [Is it] peace? 7965

9:18 So there went 3212-4 one on horseback 7392-6 5483 to meet 7125-2 him, and said, 559-4 Thus saith 559-1 the king, 4428 [Is it] peace? 7965 And Jehu 3058 said, 559-4 What hast thou to do with peace? 7965 turn 5437-3 thee behind 310 me. And the watchman 6822-6 told, 5046-55 saying, 559-2 The messenger 4397 came 935-1 to them, but he cometh not again. 7725-1

9:19 Then he sent 7971-4 out a second 8145 on horseback, 7392-6 5483 which came 935-4 to them, and said, 559-4 Thus saith 559-1 the king, 4428 [Is it] peace? 7965 And Jehu 3058 answered, 559-4 What hast thou to do with peace? 7965 turn 5437-3 thee behind 310 me.

9:20 And the watchman 6822-6 told, 5046-55 saying, 559-2 He came 935-1 even unto them, and cometh not again: 7725-1 and the driving 4491 [is] like the driving 4491 of Jehu 3058 the son 1121 of Nimshi; 5250 for he driveth 5090-4 furiously. 7697

9:21 And Joram 3088 said, 559-4 Make ready. 631-3 And his chariot 7393 was made ready. 631-4 And Joram 3088 king 4428 of Israel 3478 and Ahaziah 274 king 4428 of Judah 3063 went out, 3318-4 each 376 in his chariot, 7393 and they went out 3318-4 against 7125-2 Jehu, 3058 and met 4672-4 him in the portion 2513 of Naboth 5022 the Jezreelite. 3158

9:22 And it came to pass, when Joram 3088 saw 7200-2 Jehu, 3058 that he said, 559-4 [Is it] peace, 7965 Jehu? 3058 And he answered, 559-4 What peace, 7965 so long as 5704 the whoredoms 2183 of thy mother 517 Jezebel 348 and her witchcrafts 3785 [are so] many? 7227

9:23 And Joram 3088 turned 2015-4 his hands, 3027 and fled, 5127-4 and said 559-4 to Ahaziah, 274 [There is] treachery, 4820 O Ahaziah. 274

9:24 And Jehu 3058 drew a bow 7198 with his full 4390-14 3027 strength, and smote 5221-55 Jehoram 3088 between his arms, 2220 and the arrow 2678 went out 3318-4 at his heart, 3820 and he sunk down 3766-4 in his chariot. 7393

9:25 Then said 559-4 [Jehu] to Bidkar 920 his captain, 7991 Take up, 5375-3 [and] cast 7993-54 him in the portion 2513 of the field 7704 of Naboth 5022 the Jezreelite: 3158 for remember 2142-3 how that, when I and thou rode 7392-6 together 6776 after 310 Ahab 256 his father, 1 the LORD 3068 laid 5375-1 this burden 4853 upon him;

9:26 Surely I have seen 7200-1 yesterday 570 the blood 1818 of Naboth, 5022 and the blood 1818 of his sons, 1121 saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 and I will requite 7999-14 thee in this plat, 2513 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068 Now therefore take 5375-3 [and] cast 7993-54 him into the plat 2513 [of ground], according to the word 1697 of the LORD. 3068

9:27 But when Ahaziah 274 the king 4428 of Judah 3063 saw 7200-1 [this], he fled 5127-4 by the way 1870 of the garden 1588 house. 1004 And Jehu 3058 followed 7291-4 after 310 him, and said, 559-4 Smite 5221-54 him also in the chariot. 4818 [And they did so] at the going up 4608 to Gur, 1483 which [is] by Ibleam. 2991 And he fled 5127-4 to Megiddo, 4023 and died 4191-4 there.

9:28 And his servants 5650 carried 7392-55 him in a chariot to Jerusalem, 3389 and buried 6912-4 him in his sepulchre 6900 with his fathers 1 in the city 5892 of David. 1732

9:29 And in the 8141 eleventh 259 6240 year 8141 of Joram 3141 the son 1121 of Ahab 256 began Ahaziah 274 to reign 4427-1 over Judah. 3063

9:30 And when Jehu 3058 was come 935-4 to Jezreel, 3157 Jezebel 348 heard 8085-1 [of it]; and she painted 7760-4 6320 her face, 5869 and tired 3190-55 her head, 7218 and looked out 8259-55 at a window. 2474

9:31 And as Jehu 3058 entered in 935-1 at the gate, 8179 she said, 559-4 [Had] Zimri 2174 peace, 7965 who slew 2026-6 his master? 113

9:32 And he lifted up 5375-4 his face 6440 to the window, 2474 and said, 559-4 Who [is] on my side? who? And there looked out 8259-55 to him two 8147 [or] three 7969 eunuchs. 5631

9:33 And he said, 559-4 Throw her down. 8058-3 So they threw her down: 8058-4 and [some] of her blood 1818 was sprinkled 5137-4 on the wall, 7023 and on the horses: 5483 and he trode 7429-4 her under foot.

9:34 And when he was come in, 935-4 he did eat 398-4 and drink, 8354-4 and said, 559-4 Go, 6485-3 see now this cursed 779-7 [woman], and bury 6912-3 her: for she [is] a king's 4428 daughter. 1323

9:35 And they went 3212-4 to bury 6912-2 her: but they found 4672-1 no more of her than 518 the skull, 1538 and the feet, 7272 and the palms 3709 of [her] hands. 3027

9:36 Wherefore they came again, 7725-4 and told 5046-55 him. And he said, 559-4 This [is] the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 which he spake 1696-14 by 3027 his servant 5650 Elijah 452 the Tishbite, 8664 saying, 559-2 In the portion 2506 of Jezreel 3157 shall dogs 3611 eat 398-4 the flesh 1320 of Jezebel: 348

9:37 And the carcase 5038 of Jezebel 348 shall be as dung 1828 upon the face 6440 of the field 7704 in the portion 2506 of Jezreel; 3157 [so] that they shall not say, 559-4 This [is] Jezebel. 348

10:1 And Ahab 256 had seventy 7657 sons 1121 in Samaria. 8111 And Jehu 3058 wrote 3789-4 letters, 5612 and sent 7971-4 to Samaria, 8111 unto the rulers 8269 of Jezreel, 3157 to the elders, 2205 and to them that brought up 539-6 Ahab's 256 [children], saying, 559-2

10:2 Now as soon as this letter 5612 cometh 935-2 to you, seeing your master's 113 sons 1121 [are] with you, and [there are] with you chariots 7393 and horses, 5483 a fenced 4013 city 5892 also, and armour; 5402

10:3 Look 7200-1 even out the best 2896 and meetest 3477 of your master's 113 sons, 1121 and set 7760-1 [him] on his father's 1 throne, 3678 and fight 3898-10 for your master's 113 house. 1004

10:4 But they were exceedingly 3966 3966 afraid, 3372-4 and said, 559-4 Behold, two 8147 kings 4428 stood 5975-1 not before 6440 him: how then shall we stand? 5975-4

10:5 And he that [was] over the house, 1004 and he that [was] over the city, 5892 the elders 2205 also, and the bringers up 539-6 [of the children], sent 7971-4 to Jehu, 3058 saying, 559-2 We [are] thy servants, 5650 and will do 6213-4 all that thou shalt bid 559-4 us; we will not make any 376 king: 4427-55 do 6213-3 thou [that which is] good 2896 in thine eyes. 5869

10:6 Then he wrote 3789-4 a letter 5612 the second time 8145 to them, saying, 559-2 If ye [be] mine, and [if] ye will hearken 8085-6 unto my voice, 6963 take 3947-3 ye the heads 7218 of the men 582 your master's 113 sons, 1121 and come 935-3 to me to Jezreel 3157 by to morrow 4279 this time. 6256 Now the king's 4428 sons, 1121 [being] seventy 7657 persons, 376 [were] with the great men 1419 of the city, 5892 which brought them up. 1431-18

10:7 And it came to pass, when the letter 5612 came 935-2 to them, that they took 3947-4 the king's 4428 sons, 1121 and slew 7819-4 seventy 7657 persons, 376 and put 7760-4 their heads 7218 in baskets, 1731 and sent 7971-4 him [them] to Jezreel. 3157

10:8 And there came 935-4 a messenger, 4397 and told 5046-55 him, saying, 559-2 They have brought 935-52 the heads 7218 of the king's 4428 sons. 1121 And he said, 559-4 Lay 7760-3 ye them in two 8147 heaps 6652 at the entering in 6607 of the gate 8179 until the morning. 1242

10:9 And it came to pass in the morning, 1242 that he went out, 3318-4 and stood, 5975-4 and said 559-4 to all the people, 5971 Ye [be] righteous: 6662 behold, I conspired 7194-1 against my master, 113 and slew 2026-4 him: but who slew 5221-52 all these?

10:10 Know 3045-3 now 645 that there shall fall 5307-4 unto the earth 776 nothing of the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 which the LORD 3068 spake 1696-14 concerning the house 1004 of Ahab: 256 for the LORD 3068 hath done 6213-1 [that] which he spake 1696-14 by 3027 his servant 5650 Elijah. 452

10:11 So Jehu 3058 slew 5221-55 all that remained 7604-12 of the house 1004 of Ahab 256 in Jezreel, 3157 and all his great men, 1419 and his kinsfolks, 3045-30 and his priests, 3548 until he left 7604-52 him none remaining. 8300

10:12 And he arose 6965-4 and departed, 935-4 and came 3212-4 to Samaria. 8111 [And] as he [was] at the shearing 7462-6 house 1004|1044 in the way, 1870

10:13 Jehu 3058 met 4672-1 with the brethren 251 of Ahaziah 274 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and said, 559-4 Who [are] ye? And they answered, 559-4 We [are] the brethren 251 of Ahaziah; 274 and we go down 3381-4 to salute 7965 the children 1121 of the king 4428 and the children 1121 of the queen. 1377

10:14 And he said, 559-4 Take 8610-3 them alive. 2416 And they took 8610-4 them alive, 2416 and slew 7819-4 them at the pit 953 of the shearing house, 1004|1044 [even] two 8147 and forty 705 men; 376 neither left 7604-52 he any 376 of them.

10:15 And when he was departed 3212-4 thence, he lighted on 4672-4 Jehonadab 3082 the son 1121 of Rechab 7394 [coming] to meet 7125-2 him: and he saluted 1288-17 him, and said 559-4 to him, Is 3426 thine heart 3824 right, 3477 as my heart 3824 [is] with thy heart? 3824 And Jehonadab 3082 answered, 559-4 It is. 3426 If it be, 3426 give 5414-3 [me] thine hand. 3027 And he gave 5414-4 [him] his hand; 3027 and he took him up 5927-55 to him into the chariot. 4818

10:16 And he said, 559-4 Come 3212-3 with me, and see 7200-3 my zeal 7068 for the LORD. 3068 So they made him ride 7392-55 in his chariot. 7393

10:17 And when he came 935-4 to Samaria, 8111 he slew 5221-55 all that remained 7604-12 unto Ahab 256 in Samaria, 8111 till he had destroyed 8045-52 him, according to the saying 1697 of the LORD, 3068 which he spake 1696-14 to Elijah. 452

10:18 And Jehu 3058 gathered all the people 5971 together, 6908-4 and said 559-4 unto them, Ahab 256 served 5647-1 Baal 1168 a little; 4592 [but] Jehu 3058 shall serve 5647-4 him much. 7235-53

10:19 Now therefore call 7121-3 unto me all the prophets 5030 of Baal, 1168 all his servants, 5647-6 and all his priests; 3548 let none 376 be wanting: 6485-11 for I have a great 1419 sacrifice 2077 [to do] to Baal; 1168 whosoever shall be wanting, 6485-11 he shall not live. 2421-4 But Jehu 3058 did 6213-1 [it] in subtilty, 6122 to the intent that he might destroy 6-53 the worshippers 5647-6 of Baal. 1168

10:20 And Jehu 3058 said, 559-4 Proclaim 6942-16 a solemn assembly 6116 for Baal. 1168 And they proclaimed 7121-4 [it].

10:21 And Jehu 3058 sent 7971-4 through all Israel: 3478 and all the worshippers 5647-6 of Baal 1168 came, 935-4 so that there was not a man 376 left 7604-8 that came 935-1 not. And they came 935-4 into the house 1004 of Baal; 1168 and the house 1004 of Baal 1168 was full 4390-11 from one end 6310 to another. 6310

10:22 And he said 559-4 unto him that [was] over the vestry, 4458 Bring forth 3318-54 vestments 3830 for all the worshippers 5647-6 of Baal. 1168 And he brought them forth 3318-55 vestments. 4403

10:23 And Jehu 3058 went, 935-4 and Jehonadab 3082 the son 1121 of Rechab, 7394 into the house 1004 of Baal, 1168 and said 559-4 unto the worshippers 5647-6 of Baal, 1168 Search, 2664-16 and look 7200-3 that there be 3426 here with you none of the servants 5650 of the LORD, 3068 but the worshippers 5647-6 of Baal 1168 only.

10:24 And when they went in 935-4 to offer 6213-2 sacrifices 2077 and burnt offerings, 5930 Jehu 3058 appointed 7760-1 fourscore 8084 men 376 without, 2351 and said, 559-4 [If] any 376 of the men 582 whom I have brought 935-56 into your hands 3027 escape, 4422-11 [he that letteth him go], his life 5315 [shall be] for the life 5315 of him.

10:25 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end 3615-15 of offering 6213-2 the burnt offering, 5930 that Jehu 3058 said 559-4 to the guard 7323-5 and to the captains, 7991 Go in, 935-3 [and] slay 5221-54 them; let none 376 come forth. 3318-4 And they smote 5221-55 them with the edge 6310 of the sword; 2719 and the guard 7323-5 and the captains 7991 cast [them] out, 7993-55 and went 3212-4 to the city 5892 of the house 1004 of Baal. 1168

10:26 And they brought forth 3318-55 the images 4676 out of the house 1004 of Baal, 1168 and burned 8313-4 them.

10:27 And they brake down 5422-4 the image 4676 of Baal, 1168 and brake down 5422-4 the house 1004 of Baal, 1168 and made 7760-4 it a draught house 4163|4280-k unto this day. 3117

10:28 Thus Jehu 3058 destroyed 8045-55 Baal 1168 out of Israel. 3478

10:29 Howbeit [from] the sins 2399 of Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 who made Israel 3478 to sin, 2398-52 Jehu 3058 departed 5493-1 not from after 310 them, [to wit], the golden 2091 calves 5695 that [were] in Bethel, 1008 and that [were] in Dan. 1835

10:30 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Jehu, 3058 Because thou hast done well 2895-52 in executing 6213-2 [that which is] right 3477 in mine eyes, 5869 [and] hast done 6213-1 unto the house 1004 of Ahab 256 according to all that [was] in mine heart, 3824 thy children 1121 of the fourth 7243 [generation] shall sit 3427-4 on the throne 3678 of Israel. 3478

10:31 But Jehu 3058 took no heed 8104-1 to walk 3212-2 in the law 8451 of the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 with all his heart: 3824 for he departed 5493-1 not from the sins 2403 of Jeroboam, 3379 which made Israel 3478 to sin. 2398-52

10:32 In those days 3117 the LORD 3068 began 2490-52 to cut Israel 3478 short: 7096-15 and Hazael 2371 smote 5221-55 them in all the coasts 1366 of Israel; 3478

10:33 From Jordan 3383 eastward, 4217 8121 all the land 776 of Gilead, 1568 the Gadites, 1425 and the Reubenites, 7206 and the Manassites, 4520 from Aroer, 6177 which [is] by the river 5158 Arnon, 769 even Gilead 1568 and Bashan. 1316

10:34 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Jehu, 3058 and all that he did, 6213-1 and all his might, 1369 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel? 3478

10:35 And Jehu 3058 slept 7901-4 with his fathers: 1 and they buried 6912-4 him in Samaria. 8111 And Jehoahaz 3059 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

10:36 And the time 3117 that Jehu 3058 reigned 4427-1 over Israel 3478 in Samaria 8111 [was] twenty 6242 and eight 8083 years. 8141

11:1 And when Athaliah 6271 the mother 517 of Ahaziah 274 saw 7200-1 that her son 1121 was dead, 4191-1 she arose 6965-4 and destroyed 6-17 all the seed 2233 royal. 4467

11:2 But Jehosheba, 3089 the daughter 1323 of king 4428 Joram, 3141 sister 269 of Ahaziah, 274 took 3947-4 Joash 3101 the son 1121 of Ahaziah, 274 and stole 1589-4 him from among 8432 the king's 4428 sons 1121 [which were] slain; 4191-94 and they hid 5641-55 him, [even] him and his nurse, 3243-56 in the bedchamber 2315 4296 from 6440 Athaliah, 6271 so that he was not slain. 4191-90

11:3 And he was with her hid 2244-102 in the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 six 8337 years. 8141 And Athaliah 6271 did reign 4427-6 over the land. 776

11:4 And the seventh 7637 year 8141 Jehoiada 3077 sent 7971-1 and fetched 3947-4 the rulers 8269 over hundreds, 3967 with the captains 3746 and the guard, 7323-5 and brought 935-55 them to him into the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and made 3772-4 a covenant 1285 with them, and took an oath 7650-55 of them in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and shewed 7200-55 them the king's 4428 son. 1121

11:5 And he commanded 6680-17 them, saying, 559-2 This [is] the thing 1697 that ye shall do; 6213-4 A third part 7992 of you that enter in 935-6 on the sabbath 7676 shall even be keepers 8104-6 of the watch 4931 of the king's 4428 house; 1004

11:6 And a third part 7992 [shall be] at the gate 8179 of Sur; 5495 and a third part 7992 at the gate 8179 behind 310 the guard: 7323-5 so shall ye keep 8104-1 the watch 4931 of the house, 1004 that it be not broken down. 4535

11:7 And two 8147 parts 3027 of all you that go forth 3318-6 on the sabbath, 7676 even they shall keep 8104-1 the watch 4931 of the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 about 413 the king. 4428

11:8 And ye shall compass 5362-52 the king 4428 round about, 5439 every man 376 with his weapons 3627 in his hand: 3027 and he that cometh 935-6 within the ranges, 7713 let him be slain: 4191-93 and be ye with the king 4428 as he goeth out 3318-2 and as he cometh in. 935-2

11:9 And the captains 8269 over the hundreds 3967 did 6213-4 according to all [things] that Jehoiada 3077 the priest 3548 commanded: 6680-14 and they took 3947-4 every man 376 his men 582 that were to come in 935-6 on the sabbath, 7676 with them that should go out 3318-6 on the sabbath, 7676 and came 935-4 to Jehoiada 3077 the priest. 3548

11:10 And to the captains 8269 over hundreds 3967 did the priest 3548 give 5414-4 king 4428 David's 1732 spears 2595 and shields, 7982 that [were] in the temple 1004 of the LORD. 3068

11:11 And the guard 7323-5 stood, 5975-4 every man 376 with his weapons 3627 in his hand, 3027 round about 5439 the king, 4428 from the right 3233 corner 3802 of the temple 1004 to the left 8042 corner 3802 of the temple, 1004 [along] by the altar 4196 and the temple. 1004

11:12 And he brought forth 3318-55 the king's 4428 son, 1121 and put 5414-4 the crown 5145 upon him, and [gave him] the testimony; 5715 and they made him king, 4427-55 and anointed 4886-4 him; and they clapped 5221-55 their hands, 3709 and said, 559-4 God save 2421-4 the king. 4428

11:13 And when Athaliah 6271 heard 8085-4 the noise 6963 of the guard 7323-5 [and] of the people, 5971 she came 935-4 to the people 5971 into the temple 1004 of the LORD. 3068

11:14 And when she looked, 7200-4 behold, the king 4428 stood 5975-6 by a pillar, 5982 as the manner 4941 [was], and the princes 8269 and the trumpeters 2689 by the king, 4428 and all the people 5971 of the land 776 rejoiced, 8056 and blew 8628-6 with trumpets: 2689 and Athaliah 6271 rent 7167-4 her clothes, 899 and cried, 7121-4 Treason, 7195 Treason. 7195

11:15 But Jehoiada 3077 the priest 3548 commanded 6680-17 the captains 8269 of the hundreds, 3967 the officers 6485-7 of the host, 2428 and said 559-4 unto them, Have her forth 3318-54 without 1004 the ranges: 7713 and him that followeth 935-6 310 her kill 4191-53 with the sword. 2719 For the priest 3548 had said, 559-1 Let her not be slain 4191-93 in the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

11:16 And they laid 7760-4 hands 3027 on her; and she went 935-4 by the way 1870 by the which the horses 5483 came 3996 into the king's 4428 house: 1004 and there was she slain. 4191-93

11:17 And Jehoiada 3077 made 3772-4 a covenant 1285 between the LORD 3068 and the king 4428 and the people, 5971 that they should be the LORD'S 3068 people; 5971 between the king 4428 also and the people. 5971

11:18 And all the people 5971 of the land 776 went 935-4 into the house 1004 of Baal, 1168 and brake it down; 5422-4 his altars 4196 and his images 6754 brake they in pieces 7665-14 thoroughly, 3190-53 and slew 2026-1 Mattan 4977 the priest 3548 of Baal 1168 before 6440 the altars. 4196 And the priest 3548 appointed 7760-4 officers 6485-7|6486-q over the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

11:19 And he took 3947-4 the rulers 8269 over hundreds, 3967 and the captains, 3746 and the guard, 7323-5 and all the people 5971 of the land; 776 and they brought down 3381-55 the king 4428 from the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and came 935-4 by the way 1870 of the gate 8179 of the guard 7323-5 to the king's 4428 house. 1004 And he sat 3427-4 on the throne 3678 of the kings. 4428

11:20 And all the people 5971 of the land 776 rejoiced, 8055-4 and the city 5892 was in quiet: 8252-1 and they slew 4191-52 Athaliah 6271 with the sword 2719 [beside] the king's 4428 house. 1004

11:21 Seven 7651 years 8141 old 1121 [was] Jehoash 3060 when he began to reign. 4427-2

12:1 In the seventh 7651 year 8141 of Jehu 3058 Jehoash 3060 began to reign; 4427-1 and forty 705 years 8141 reigned 4427-1 he in Jerusalem. 3389 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Zibiah 6645 of Beersheba. 884

12:2 And Jehoash 3060 did 6213-4 [that which was] right 3477 in the sight 5869 of the LORD 3068 all his days 3117 wherein Jehoiada 3077 the priest 3548 instructed 3384-52 him.

12:3 But the high places 1116 were not taken away: 5493-1 the people 5971 still sacrificed 2076-18 and burnt incense 6999-18 in the high places. 1116

12:4 And Jehoash 3060 said 559-4 to the priests, 3548 All the money 3701 of the dedicated things 6944 that is brought into 935-93 the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 [even] the money 3701 of every one 376 that passeth 5674-6 [the account], the money 3701 that every man 5315 is set at, 6187 [and] all the money 3701 that cometh 5927-4 into any man's 376 heart 3820 to bring 935-53 into the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068

12:5 Let the priests 3548 take 3947-4 [it] to them, every man 376 of his acquaintance: 4378 and let them repair 2388-17 the breaches 919 of the house, 1004 wheresoever any breach 919 shall be found. 4672-11

12:6 But it was [so, that] in the three 7969 8141 and twentieth 6242 year 8141 of king 4428 Jehoash 3060 the priests 3548 had not repaired 2388-14 the breaches 919 of the house. 1004

12:7 Then king 4428 Jehoash 3060 called 7121-4 for Jehoiada 3077 the priest, 3548 and the [other] priests, 3548 and said 559-4 unto them, Why repair 2388-18 ye not the breaches 919 of the house? 1004 now therefore receive 3947-4 no [more] money 3701 of your acquaintance, 4378 but deliver 5414-4 it for the breaches 919 of the house. 1004

12:8 And the priests 3548 consented 225-11 to receive 3947-2 no 1115 [more] money 3701 of the people, 5971 neither 1115 to repair 2388-15 the breaches 919 of the house. 1004

12:9 But Jehoiada 3077 the priest 3548 took 3947-4 a 259 chest, 727 and bored 5344-4 a hole 2356 in the lid 1817 of it, and set 5414-4 it beside 681 the altar, 4196 on the right side 3225 as one 376 cometh 935-2 into the house 1004 of the LORD: 3068 and the priests 3548 that kept 8104-6 the door 5592 put 5414-1 therein all the money 3701 [that was] brought into 935-94 the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

12:10 And it was [so], when they saw 7200-2 that [there was] much 7227 money 3701 in the chest, 727 that the king's 4428 scribe 5608-6 and the high 1419 priest 3548 came up, 5927-4 and they put up in bags, 6696-4 and told 4487-4 the money 3701 that was found 4672-12 in the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

12:11 And they gave 5414-1 the money, 3701 being told, 8505-30 into the hands 3027 of them that did 6213-6 the work, 4399 that had the oversight 6485-94|6485-7-k of the house 1004 of the LORD: 3068 and they laid it out 3318-55 to the carpenters 2796 6086 and builders, 1129-6 that wrought 6213-6 upon the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068

12:12 And to masons, 1443-6 and hewers 2672-6 of stone, 68 and to buy 7069-2 timber 6086 and hewed 4274 stone 68 to repair 2388-15 the breaches 919 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and for all that was laid out 3318-4 for the house 1004 to repair 2393 [it].

12:13 Howbeit there were not made 6213-11 for the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 bowls 5592 of silver, 3701 snuffers, 4212 basons, 4219 trumpets, 2689 any vessels 3627 of gold, 2091 or vessels 3627 of silver, 3701 of the money 3701 [that was] brought into 935-94 the house 1004 of the LORD: 3068

12:14 But they gave 5414-4 that to the workmen, 4399 6213-6 and repaired 2388-14 therewith the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

12:15 Moreover they reckoned 2803-17 not with the men, 582 into whose hand 3027 they delivered 5414-4 the money 3701 to be bestowed 5414-2 on workmen: 6213-6 4399 for they dealt 6213-6 faithfully. 530

12:16 The trespass 817 money 3701 and sin 2403 money 3701 was not brought into 935-93 the house 1004 of the LORD: 3068 it was the priests'. 3548

12:17 Then Hazael 2371 king 4428 of Syria 758 went up, 5927-4 and fought 3898-11 against Gath, 1661 and took 3920-4 it: and Hazael 2371 set 7760-4 his face 6440 to go up 5927-2 to Jerusalem. 3389

12:18 And Jehoash 3060 king 4428 of Judah 3063 took 3947-4 all the hallowed things 6944 that Jehoshaphat, 3092 and Jehoram, 3088 and Ahaziah, 274 his fathers, 1 kings 4428 of Judah, 3063 had dedicated, 6942-52 and his own hallowed things, 6944 and all the gold 2091 [that was] found 4672-12 in the treasures 214 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and in the king's 4428 house, 1004 and sent 7971-4 [it] to Hazael 2371 king 4428 of Syria: 758 and he went away 5927-4 from Jerusalem. 3389

12:19 And the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Joash, 3101 and all that he did, 6213-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Judah? 3063

12:20 And his servants 5650 arose, 6965-4 and made 7194-4 a conspiracy, 7195 and slew 5221-55 Joash 3101 in the house 1004 of Millo, 4407 which goeth down 3381-6 to Silla. 5538

12:21 For Jozachar 3108 the son 1121 of Shimeath, 8100 and Jehozabad 3075 the son 1121 of Shomer, 7763 his servants, 5650 smote 5221-52 him, and he died; 4191-4 and they buried 6912-4 him with his fathers 1 in the city 5892 of David: 1732 and Amaziah 558 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

13:1 In the three 7969 8141 and twentieth 6242 year 8141 of Joash 3101 the son 1121 of Ahaziah 274 king 4428 of Judah 3063 Jehoahaz 3059 the son 1121 of Jehu 3058 began to reign 4427-1 over Israel 3478 in Samaria, 8111 [and reigned] seventeen 7651 6240 years. 8141

13:2 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 and followed 3212-4 310 the sins 2403 of Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 which made Israel 3478 to sin; 2398-52 he departed 5493-1 not therefrom.

13:3 And the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 was kindled 2734-4 against Israel, 3478 and he delivered 5414-4 them into the hand 3027 of Hazael 2371 king 4428 of Syria, 758 and into the hand 3027 of Benhadad 1130 the son 1121 of Hazael, 2371 all [their] days. 3117

13:4 And Jehoahaz 3059 besought 2470-17 6440 the LORD, 3068 and the LORD 3068 hearkened 8085-4 unto him: for he saw 7200-1 the oppression 3906 of Israel, 3478 because the king 4428 of Syria 758 oppressed 3905-1 them.

13:5 (And the LORD 3068 gave 5414-4 Israel 3478 a saviour, 3467-56 so that they went out 3318-4 from under the hand 3027 of the Syrians: 758 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 dwelt 3427-4 in their tents, 168 as beforetime. 8032 8543

13:6 Nevertheless they departed 5493-1 not from the sins 2403 of the house 1004 of Jeroboam, 3379 who made Israel 3478 sin, 2398-52 [but] walked 1980-1 therein: and there remained 5975-1 the grove 842 also in Samaria.) 8111

13:7 Neither did he leave 7604-52 of the people 5971 to Jehoahaz 3059 but fifty 2572 horsemen, 6571 and ten 6235 chariots, 7393 and ten 6235 thousand 505 footmen; 7273 for the king 4428 of Syria 758 had destroyed 6-14 them, and had made 7760-4 them like the dust 6083 by threshing. 1758-2

13:8 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Jehoahaz, 3059 and all that he did, 6213-1 and his might, 1369 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel? 3478

13:9 And Jehoahaz 3059 slept 7901-4 with his fathers; 1 and they buried 6912-4 him in Samaria: 8111 and Joash 3101 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

13:10 In the thirty 7970 8141 and seventh 7651 year 8141 of Joash 3101 king 4428 of Judah 3063 began Jehoash 3060 the son 1121 of Jehoahaz 3059 to reign 4427-1 over Israel 3478 in Samaria, 8111 [and reigned] sixteen 8337 6240 years. 8141

13:11 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD; 3068 he departed 5493-1 not from all the sins 2403 of Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 who made Israel 3478 sin: 2398-52 [but] he walked 1980-1 therein.

13:12 And the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Joash, 3101 and all that he did, 6213-1 and his might 1369 wherewith he fought 3898-8 against Amaziah 558 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel? 3478

13:13 And Joash 3101 slept 7901-4 with his fathers; 1 and Jeroboam 3379 sat 3427-1 upon his throne: 3678 and Joash 3101 was buried 6912-11 in Samaria 8111 with the kings 4428 of Israel. 3478

13:14 Now Elisha 477 was fallen sick 2470-1 of his sickness 2483 whereof he died. 4191-4 And Joash 3101 the king 4428 of Israel 3478 came down 3381-4 unto him, and wept 1058-4 over his face, 6440 and said, 559-4 O my father, 1 my father, 1 the chariot 7393 of Israel, 3478 and the horsemen 6571 thereof.

13:15 And Elisha 477 said 559-4 unto him, Take 3947-3 bow 7198 and arrows. 2671 And he took 3947-4 unto him bow 7198 and arrows. 2671

13:16 And he said 559-4 to the king 4428 of Israel, 3478 Put 7392-54 thine hand 3027 upon the bow. 7198 And he put 7392-55 his hand 3027 [upon it]: and Elisha 477 put 7760-4 his hands 3027 upon the king's 4428 hands. 3027

13:17 And he said, 559-4 Open 6605-3 the window 2474 eastward. 6924 And he opened 6605-4 [it]. Then Elisha 477 said, 559-4 Shoot. 3384-3 And he shot. 3384-55 And he said, 559-4 The arrow 2671 of the LORD'S 3068 deliverance, 8668 and the arrow 2671 of deliverance 8668 from Syria: 758 for thou shalt smite 5221-52 the Syrians 758 in Aphek, 663 till thou have consumed 3615-15 [them].

13:18 And he said, 559-4 Take 3947-3 the arrows. 2671 And he took 3947-4 [them]. And he said 559-4 unto the king 4428 of Israel, 3478 Smite 5221-54 upon the ground. 776 And he smote 5221-55 thrice, 7969 6471 and stayed. 5975-4

13:19 And the man 376 of God 430 was wroth 7107-4 with him, and said, 559-4 Thou shouldest have smitten 5221-53 five 2568 or six 8337 times; 6471 then hadst thou smitten 5221-52 Syria 758 till thou hadst consumed 3615-15 [it]: whereas now thou shalt smite 5221-55 Syria 758 [but] thrice. 7969 6471

13:20 And Elisha 477 died, 4191-4 and they buried 6912-4 him. And the bands 1416 of the Moabites 4124 invaded 935-4 the land 776 at the coming in 935-6 of the year. 8141

13:21 And it came to pass, as they were burying 6912-6 a man, 376 that, behold, they spied 7200-1 a band 1416 [of men]; and they cast 7993-55 the man 376 into the sepulchre 6913 of Elisha: 477 and when the man 376 was let down, 3212-4 and touched 5060-4 the bones 6106 of Elisha, 477 he revived, 2421-4 and stood up 6965-4 on his feet. 7272

13:22 But Hazael 2371 king 4428 of Syria 758 oppressed 3905-1 Israel 3478 all the days 3117 of Jehoahaz. 3059

13:23 And the LORD 3068 was gracious 2603-4 unto them, and had compassion 7355-17 on them, and had respect 6437-4 unto them, because of 4616 his covenant 1285 with Abraham, 85 Isaac, 3327 and Jacob, 3290 and would 14-1 not destroy 7843-53 them, neither cast 7993-52 he them from his presence 6440 as yet. 5704

13:24 So Hazael 2371 king 4428 of Syria 758 died; 4191-4 and Benhadad 1130 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

13:25 And Jehoash 3060 the son 1121 of Jehoahaz 3059 took 3947-4 again 7725-4 out of the hand 3027 of Benhadad 1130 the son 1121 of Hazael 2371 the cities, 5892 which he had taken 3947-1 out of the hand 3027 of Jehoahaz 3059 his father 1 by war. 4421 Three 7969 times 6471 did Joash 3101 beat 5221-52 him, and recovered 7725-55 the cities 5892 of Israel. 3478

14:1 In the second 8147 year 8141 of Joash 3101 son 1121 of Jehoahaz 3099 king 4428 of Israel 3478 reigned 4427-1 Amaziah 558 the son 1121 of Joash 3101 king 4428 of Judah. 3063

14:2 He was twenty 6242 and five 2568 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and reigned 4427-1 twenty 6242 and nine 8672 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Jehoaddan 3086 of Jerusalem. 3389

14:3 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] right 3477 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 yet 7535 not like David 1732 his father: 1 he did 6213-1 according to all things as Joash 3101 his father 1 did. 6213-1

14:4 Howbeit the high places 1116 were not taken away: 5493-1 as yet 5750 the people 5971 did sacrifice 2076-18 and burnt incense 6999-18 on the high places. 1116

14:5 And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom 4467 was confirmed 2388-1 in his hand, 3027 that he slew 5221-55 his servants 5650 which had slain 5221-56 the king 4428 his father. 1

14:6 But the children 1121 of the murderers 5221-56 he slew 4191-52 not: according unto that which is written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the law 8451 of Moses, 4872 wherein the LORD 3068 commanded, 6680-14 saying, 559-2 The fathers 1 shall not be put to death 4191-93 for the children, 1121 nor the children 1121 be put to death 4191-93 for the fathers; 1 but every man 376 shall be put to death 4191-93|4191-4-k for his own sin. 2399

14:7 He slew 5221-52 of Edom 123 in the valley 1516 of salt 4417 ten 6235 thousand, 505 and took 8610-1 Selah 5554 by war, 4421 and called 7121-4 the name 8034 of it Joktheel 3371 unto this day. 3117

14:8 Then Amaziah 558 sent 7971-1 messengers 4397 to Jehoash, 3060 the son 1121 of Jehoahaz 3059 son 1121 of Jehu, 3058 king 4428 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 Come, 3212-3 let us look 7200-101 one another in the face. 6440

14:9 And Jehoash 3060 the king 4428 of Israel 3478 sent 7971-4 to Amaziah 558 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 saying, 559-2 The thistle 2336 that [was] in Lebanon 3844 sent 7971-1 to the cedar 730 that [was] in Lebanon, 3844 saying, 559-2 Give 5414-3 thy daughter 1323 to my son 1121 to wife: 802 and there passed by 5674-4 a wild 7704 beast 2416 that [was] in Lebanon, 3844 and trode down 7429-4 the thistle. 2336

14:10 Thou hast indeed 5221-53 smitten 5221-52 Edom, 123 and thine heart 3820 hath lifted thee up: 5375-1 glory 3513-10 [of this], and tarry 3427-3 at home: 1004 for why shouldest thou meddle 1624-101 to [thy] hurt, 7451 that thou shouldest fall, 5307-1 [even] thou, and Judah 3063 with thee?

14:11 But Amaziah 558 would not hear. 8085-1 Therefore Jehoash 3060 king 4428 of Israel 3478 went up; 5927-4 and he and Amaziah 558 king 4428 of Judah 3063 looked 7200-101 one another in the face 6440 at Bethshemesh, 1053 which [belongeth] to Judah. 3063

14:12 And Judah 3063 was put to the worse 5062-11 before 6440 Israel; 3478 and they fled 5127-4 every man 376 to their tents. 168

14:13 And Jehoash 3060 king 4428 of Israel 3478 took 8610-1 Amaziah 558 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 the son 1121 of Jehoash 3060 the son 1121 of Ahaziah, 274 at Bethshemesh, 1053 and came 935-4 to Jerusalem, 3389 and brake down 6555-4 the wall 2346 of Jerusalem 3389 from the gate 8179 of Ephraim 669 unto the corner 6438 gate, 8179 four 702 hundred 3967 cubits. 520

14:14 And he took 3947-1 all the gold 2091 and silver, 3701 and all the vessels 3627 that were found 4672-12 in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and in the treasures 214 of the king's 4428 house, 1004 and hostages, 1121 8594 and returned 7725-4 to Samaria. 8111

14:15 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Jehoash 3060 which he did, 6213-1 and his might, 1369 and how he fought 3898-8 with Amaziah 558 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel? 3478

14:16 And Jehoash 3060 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and was buried 6912-11 in Samaria 8111 with the kings 4428 of Israel; 3478 and Jeroboam 3379 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

14:17 And Amaziah 558 the son 1121 of Joash 3101 king 4428 of Judah 3063 lived 2421-4 after 310 the death 4194 of Jehoash 3060 son 1121 of Jehoahaz 3059 king 4428 of Israel 3478 fifteen 2568 6240 years. 8141

14:18 And the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Amaziah, 558 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Judah? 3063

14:19 Now they made 7194-4 a conspiracy 7195 against him in Jerusalem: 3389 and he fled 5127-4 to Lachish; 3923 but they sent 7971-4 after 310 him to Lachish, 3923 and slew 4191-55 him there.

14:20 And they brought 5375-4 him on horses: 5483 and he was buried 6912-11 at Jerusalem 3389 with his fathers 1 in the city 5892 of David. 1732

14:21 And all the people 5971 of Judah 3063 took 3947-4 Azariah, 5838 which [was] sixteen 8337 6240 years 8141 old, 1121 and made him king 4427-55 instead of his father 1 Amaziah. 558

14:22 He built 1129-1 Elath, 359 and restored 7725-55 it to Judah, 3063 after 310 that the king 4428 slept 7901-2 with his fathers. 1

14:23 In the 8141 fifteenth 2568 6240 year 8141 of Amaziah 558 the son 1121 of Joash 3101 king 4428 of Judah 3063 Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Joash 3101 king 4428 of Israel 3478 began to reign 4427-1 in Samaria, 8111 [and reigned] forty 705 and one 259 years. 8141

14:24 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD: 3068 he departed 5493-1 not from all the sins 2403 of Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 who made Israel 3478 to sin. 2398-52

14:25 He restored 7725-52 the coast 1366 of Israel 3478 from the entering 935-2 of Hamath 2574 unto the sea 3220 of the plain, 6160 according to the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 which he spake 1696-14 by the hand 3027 of his servant 5650 Jonah, 3124 the son 1121 of Amittai, 573 the prophet, 5030 which [was] of Gathhepher. 1661|2660|1662

14:26 For the LORD 3068 saw 7200-1 the affliction 6040 of Israel, 3478 [that it was] very 3966 bitter: 4784-6 for [there was] not any 657 shut up, 6113-7 nor any 657 left, 5800-7 nor any helper 5826-6 for Israel. 3478

14:27 And the LORD 3068 said 1696-14 not that he would blot out 4229-2 the name 8034 of Israel 3478 from under heaven: 8064 but he saved 3467-55 them by the hand 3027 of Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Joash. 3101

14:28 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Jeroboam, 3379 and all that he did, 6213-1 and his might, 1369 how he warred, 3898-8 and how he recovered 7725-52 Damascus, 1834 and Hamath, 2574 [which belonged] to Judah, 3063 for Israel, 3478 are they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel? 3478

14:29 And Jeroboam 3379 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 [even] with the kings 4428 of Israel; 3478 and Zachariah 2148 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

15:1 In the 8141 twenty 6242 and seventh 7651 year 8141 of Jeroboam 3379 king 4428 of Israel 3478 began Azariah 5838 son 1121 of Amaziah 558 king 4428 of Judah 3063 to reign. 4427-1

15:2 Sixteen 8337 6240 years 8141 old 1121 was he when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 two 8147 and fifty 2572 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Jecholiah 3203 of Jerusalem. 3389

15:3 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] right 3477 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 according to all that his father 1 Amaziah 558 had done; 6213-1

15:4 Save that the high places 1116 were not removed: 5493-1 the people 5971 sacrificed 2076-18 and burnt incense 6999-18 still on the high places. 1116

15:5 And the LORD 3068 smote 5060-17 the king, 4428 so that he was a leper 6879-30 unto the day 3117 of his death, 4194 and dwelt 3427-4 in a several 2669 house. 1004 And Jotham 3147 the king's 4428 son 1121 [was] over the house, 1004 judging 8199-6 the people 5971 of the land. 776

15:6 And the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Azariah, 5838 and all that he did, 6213-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Judah? 3063

15:7 So Azariah 5838 slept 7901-4 with his fathers; 1 and they buried 6912-4 him with his fathers 1 in the city 5892 of David: 1732 and Jotham 3147 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

15:8 In the 8141 thirty 7970 and eighth 8083 year 8141 of Azariah 5838 king 4428 of Judah 3063 did Zachariah 2148 the son 1121 of Jeroboam 3379 reign 4427-1 over Israel 3478 in Samaria 8111 six 8337 months. 2320

15:9 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 as his fathers 1 had done: 6213-1 he departed 5493-1 not from the sins 2403 of Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 who made Israel 3478 to sin. 2398-52

15:10 And Shallum 7967 the son 1121 of Jabesh 3003 conspired 7194-4 against him, and smote 5221-55 him before 6905 the people, 5971 and slew 4191-55 him, and reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

15:11 And the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Zachariah, 2148 behold, they [are] written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel. 3478

15:12 This [was] the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 which he spake 1696-14 unto Jehu, 3058 saying, 559-2 Thy sons 1121 shall sit 3427-4 on the throne 3678 of Israel 3478 unto the fourth 7243 [generation]. And so it came to pass.

15:13 Shallum 7967 the son 1121 of Jabesh 3003 began to reign 4427-1 in the nine 8672 8141 and thirtieth 7970 year 8141 of Uzziah 5818 king 4428 of Judah; 3063 and he reigned 4427-4 a full month 3391 3117 in Samaria. 8111

15:14 For Menahem 4505 the son 1121 of Gadi 1424 went up 5927-4 from Tirzah, 8656 and came 935-4 to Samaria, 8111 and smote 5221-55 Shallum 7967 the son 1121 of Jabesh 3003 in Samaria, 8111 and slew 4191-55 him, and reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

15:15 And the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Shallum, 7967 and his conspiracy 7195 which he made, 7194-1 behold, they [are] written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel. 3478

15:16 Then Menahem 4505 smote 5221-55 Tiphsah, 8607 and all that [were] therein, and the coasts 1366 thereof from Tirzah: 8656 because they opened 6605-1 not [to him], therefore he smote 5221-55 [it; and] all the women therein that were with child 2030 he ripped up. 1234-14

15:17 In the nine 8672 8141 and thirtieth 7970 year 8141 of Azariah 5838 king 4428 of Judah 3063 began Menahem 4505 the son 1121 of Gadi 1424 to reign 4427-1 over Israel, 3478 [and reigned] ten 6235 years 8141 in Samaria. 8111

15:18 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD: 3068 he departed 5493-1 not all his days 3117 from the sins 2403 of Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 who made Israel 3478 to sin. 2398-52

15:19 [And] Pul 6322 the king 4428 of Assyria 804 came 935-1 against the land: 776 and Menahem 4505 gave 5414-4 Pul 6322 a thousand 505 talents 3603 of silver, 3701 that his hand 3027 might be with him to confirm 2388-53 the kingdom 4467 in his hand. 3027

15:20 And Menahem 4505 exacted 3318-55 the money 3701 of Israel, 3478 [even] of all the mighty men 1368 of wealth, 2428 of each 259 man 376 fifty 2572 shekels 8255 of silver, 3701 to give 5414-2 to the king 4428 of Assyria. 804 So the king 4428 of Assyria 804 turned back, 7725-4 and stayed 5975-1 not there in the land. 776

15:21 And the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Menahem, 4505 and all that he did, 6213-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel? 3478

15:22 And Menahem 4505 slept 7901-4 with his fathers; 1 and Pekahiah 6494 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

15:23 In the 8141 fiftieth 2572 year 8141 of Azariah 5838 king 4428 of Judah 3063 Pekahiah 6494 the son 1121 of Menahem 4505 began to reign 4427-1 over Israel 3478 in Samaria, 8111 [and reigned] two years. 8141

15:24 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD: 3068 he departed 5493-1 not from the sins 2403 of Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 who made Israel 3478 to sin. 2398-52

15:25 But Pekah 6492 the son 1121 of Remaliah, 7425 a captain 7991 of his, conspired 7194-4 against him, and smote 5221-55 him in Samaria, 8111 in the palace 759 of the king's 4428 house, 1004 with Argob 709 and Arieh, 745 and with him fifty 2572 men 376 of the Gileadites: 1121 1569 and he killed 4191-55 him, and reigned 4427-4 in his room.

15:26 And the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Pekahiah, 6494 and all that he did, 6213-1 behold, they [are] written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel. 3478

15:27 In the 8141 two 8147 and fiftieth 2572 year 8141 of Azariah 5838 king 4428 of Judah 3063 Pekah 6492 the son 1121 of Remaliah 7425 began to reign 4427-1 over Israel 3478 in Samaria, 8111 [and reigned] twenty 6242 years. 8141

15:28 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD: 3068 he departed 5493-1 not from the sins 2403 of Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 who made Israel 3478 to sin. 2398-52

15:29 In the days 3117 of Pekah 6492 king 4428 of Israel 3478 came 935-1 Tiglathpileser 8407 king 4428 of Assyria, 804 and took 3947-4 Ijon, 5859 and Abelbethmaachah, 59|1038|62 and Janoah, 3239 and Kedesh, 6943 and Hazor, 2674 and Gilead, 1568 and Galilee, 1551 all the land 776 of Naphtali, 5321 and carried them captive 1540-55 to Assyria. 804

15:30 And Hoshea 1954 the son 1121 of Elah 425 made 7194-4 a conspiracy 7195 against Pekah 6492 the son 1121 of Remaliah, 7425 and smote 5221-55 him, and slew 4191-55 him, and reigned 4427-4 in his stead, in the twentieth 6242 year 8141 of Jotham 3147 the son 1121 of Uzziah. 5818

15:31 And the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Pekah, 6492 and all that he did, 6213-1 behold, they [are] written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel. 3478

15:32 In the second 8147 year 8141 of Pekah 6492 the son 1121 of Remaliah 7425 king 4428 of Israel 3478 began Jotham 3147 the son 1121 of Uzziah 5818 king 4428 of Judah 3063 to reign. 4427-1

15:33 Five 2568 and twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 was he when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 sixteen 8337 6240 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Jerusha, 3388 the daughter 1323 of Zadok. 6659

15:34 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] right 3477 in the sight 5869 of the LORD: 3068 he did 6213-1 according to all that his father 1 Uzziah 5818 had done. 6213-1

15:35 Howbeit the high places 1116 were not removed: 5493-1 the people 5971 sacrificed 2076-18 and burned incense 6999-18 still in the high places. 1116 He built 1129-1 the higher 5945 gate 8179 of the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

15:36 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Jotham, 3147 and all that he did, 6213-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Judah? 3063

15:37 In those days 3117 the LORD 3068 began 2490-52 to send 7971-53 against Judah 3063 Rezin 7526 the king 4428 of Syria, 758 and Pekah 6492 the son 1121 of Remaliah. 7425

15:38 And Jotham 3147 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and was buried 6912-11 with his fathers 1 in the city 5892 of David 1732 his father: 1 and Ahaz 271 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

16:1 In the 8141 seventeenth 7651 6240 year 8141 of Pekah 6492 the son 1121 of Remaliah 7425 Ahaz 271 the son 1121 of Jotham 3147 king 4428 of Judah 3063 began to reign. 4427-1

16:2 Twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 [was] Ahaz 271 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and reigned 4427-1 sixteen 8337 6240 years 8141 in Jerusalem, 3389 and did 6213-1 not [that which was] right 3477 in the sight 5869 of the LORD 3068 his God, 430 like David 1732 his father. 1

16:3 But he walked 3212-4 in the way 1870 of the kings 4428 of Israel, 3478 yea, and made his son 1121 to pass 5674-52 through the fire, 784 according to the abominations 8441 of the heathen, 1471 whom the LORD 3068 cast out 3423-52 from before 6440 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

16:4 And he sacrificed 2076-17 and burnt incense 6999-17 in the high places, 1116 and on the hills, 1389 and under every green 7488 tree. 6086

16:5 Then Rezin 7526 king 4428 of Syria 758 and Pekah 6492 son 1121 of Remaliah 7425 king 4428 of Israel 3478 came up 5927-4 to Jerusalem 3389 to war: 4421 and they besieged 6696-4 Ahaz, 271 but could 3201-1 not overcome 3898-9 [him].

16:6 At that time 6256 Rezin 7526 king 4428 of Syria 758 recovered 7725-52 Elath 359 to Syria, 758 and drave 5394-17 the Jews 3064 from Elath: 359 and the Syrians 130 came 935-1 to Elath, 359 and dwelt 3427-4 there unto this day. 3117

16:7 So Ahaz 271 sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 to Tiglathpileser 8407 king 4428 of Assyria, 804 saying, 559-2 I [am] thy servant 5650 and thy son: 1121 come up, 5927-3 and save 3467-54 me out of the hand 3709 of the king 4428 of Syria, 758 and out of the hand 3709 of the king 4428 of Israel, 3478 which rise up 6965-5 against me.

16:8 And Ahaz 271 took 3947-4 the silver 3701 and gold 2091 that was found 4672-12 in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and in the treasures 214 of the king's 4428 house, 1004 and sent 7971-4 [it for] a present 7810 to the king 4428 of Assyria. 804

16:9 And the king 4428 of Assyria 804 hearkened 8085-4 unto him: for the king 4428 of Assyria 804 went up 5927-4 against Damascus, 1834 and took 8610-4 it, and carried [the people of] it captive 1540-55 to Kir, 7024 and slew 4191-52 Rezin. 7526

16:10 And king 4428 Ahaz 271 went 3212-4 to Damascus 1834 to meet 7125-2 Tiglathpileser 8407 king 4428 of Assyria, 804 and saw 7200-4 an altar 4196 that [was] at Damascus: 1834 and king 4428 Ahaz 271 sent 7971-4 to Urijah 223 the priest 3548 the fashion 1823 of the altar, 4196 and the pattern 8403 of it, according to all the workmanship 4639 thereof.

16:11 And Urijah 223 the priest 3548 built 1129-4 an altar 4196 according to all that king 4428 Ahaz 271 had sent 7971-1 from Damascus: 1834 so Urijah 223 the priest 3548 made 6213-1 [it] against king 4428 Ahaz 271 came 935-2 from Damascus. 1834

16:12 And when the king 4428 was come 935-4 from Damascus, 1834 the king 4428 saw 7200-4 the altar: 4196 and the king 4428 approached 7126-4 to the altar, 4196 and offered 5927-55 thereon.

16:13 And he burnt 6999-55 his burnt offering 5930 and his meat offering, 4503 and poured 5258-55 his drink offering, 5262 and sprinkled 2236-4 the blood 1818 of his peace offerings, 8002 upon the altar. 4196

16:14 And he brought 7126-55 also the brasen 5178 altar, 4196 which [was] before 6440 the LORD, 3068 from the forefront 6440 of the house, 1004 from between the altar 4196 and the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and put 5414-4 it on the north 6828 side 3409 of the altar. 4196

16:15 And king 4428 Ahaz 271 commanded 6680-17 Urijah 223 the priest, 3548 saying, 559-2 Upon the great 1419 altar 4196 burn 6999-54 the morning 1242 burnt offering, 5930 and the evening 6153 meat offering, 4503 and the king's 4428 burnt sacrifice, 5930 and his meat offering, 4503 with the burnt offering 5930 of all the people 5971 of the land, 776 and their meat offering, 4503 and their drink offerings; 5262 and sprinkle 2236-4 upon it all the blood 1818 of the burnt offering, 5930 and all the blood 1818 of the sacrifice: 2077 and the brasen 5178 altar 4196 shall be for me to enquire 1239-15 [by].

16:16 Thus did 6213-4 Urijah 223 the priest, 3548 according to all that king 4428 Ahaz 271 commanded. 6680-14

16:17 And king 4428 Ahaz 271 cut off 7112-17 the borders 4526 of the bases, 4350 and removed 5493-55 the laver 3595 from off them; and took down 3381-52 the sea 3220 from off the brasen 5178 oxen 1241 that [were] under it, and put 5414-4 it upon a pavement 4837 of stones. 68

16:18 And the covert 4329|4329-k for the sabbath 7676 that they had built 1129-1 in the house, 1004 and the king's 4428 entry 3996 without, 2435 turned 5437-52 he from the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 for 6440 the king 4428 of Assyria. 804

16:19 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Ahaz 271 which he did, 6213-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Judah? 3063

16:20 And Ahaz 271 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and was buried 6912-11 with his fathers 1 in the city 5892 of David: 1732 and Hezekiah 2396 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

17:1 In the twelfth 8147 6240 year 8141 of Ahaz 271 king 4428 of Judah 3063 began Hoshea 1954 the son 1121 of Elah 425 to reign 4427-1 in Samaria 8111 over Israel 3478 nine 8672 years. 8141

17:2 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 but not as the kings 4428 of Israel 3478 that were before 6440 him.

17:3 Against him came up 5927-1 Shalmaneser 8022 king 4428 of Assyria; 804 and Hoshea 1954 became his servant, 5650 and gave 7725-55 him presents. 4503

17:4 And the king 4428 of Assyria 804 found 4672-4 conspiracy 7195 in Hoshea: 1954 for he had sent 7971-1 messengers 4397 to So 5471 king 4428 of Egypt, 4714 and brought 5927-52 no present 4503 to the king 4428 of Assyria, 804 as [he had done] year 8141 by year: 8141 therefore the king 4428 of Assyria 804 shut him up, 6113-4 and bound 631-4 him in prison. 1004 3608

17:5 Then the king 4428 of Assyria 804 came up 5927-4 throughout all the land, 776 and went up 5927-4 to Samaria, 8111 and besieged 6696-4 it three 7969 years. 8141

17:6 In the ninth 8671 year 8141 of Hoshea 1954 the king 4428 of Assyria 804 took 3920-1 Samaria, 8111 and carried Israel 3478 away 1540-55 into Assyria, 804 and placed 3427-55 them in Halah 2477 and in Habor 2249 [by] the river 5104 of Gozan, 1470 and in the cities 5892 of the Medes. 4074

17:7 For [so] it was, that the children 1121 of Israel 3478 had sinned 2398-1 against the LORD 3068 their God, 430 which had brought them up 5927-56 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 from under the hand 3027 of Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt, 4714 and had feared 3372-4 other 312 gods, 430

17:8 And walked 3212-4 in the statutes 2708 of the heathen, 1471 whom the LORD 3068 cast out 3423-52 from before 6440 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and of the kings 4428 of Israel, 3478 which they had made. 6213-1

17:9 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did secretly 2644-17 [those] things 1697 that [were] not right against the LORD 3068 their God, 430 and they built 1129-4 them high places 1116 in all their cities, 5892 from the tower 4026 of the watchmen 5341-6 to the fenced 4013 city. 5892

17:10 And they set them up 5324-55 images 4676 and groves 842 in every high 1364 hill, 1389 and under every green 7488 tree: 6086

17:11 And there they burnt incense 6999-17 in all the high places, 1116 as [did] the heathen 1471 whom the LORD 3068 carried away 1540-52 before 6440 them; and wrought 6213-4 wicked 7451 things 1697 to provoke the LORD 3068 to anger: 3707-53

17:12 For they served 5647-4 idols, 1544 whereof the LORD 3068 had said 559-1 unto them, Ye shall not do 6213-4 this thing. 1697

17:13 Yet the LORD 3068 testified 5749-55 against Israel, 3478 and against Judah, 3063 by 3027 all the prophets, 5030 [and by] all the seers, 2374 saying, 559-2 Turn 7725-3 ye from your evil 7451 ways, 1870 and keep 8104-3 my commandments 4687 [and] my statutes, 2708 according to all the law 8451 which I commanded 6680-14 your fathers, 1 and which I sent 7971-1 to you by 3027 my servants 5650 the prophets. 5030

17:14 Notwithstanding they would not hear, 8085-1 but hardened 7185-55 their necks, 6203 like to the neck 6203 of their fathers, 1 that did not believe 539-52 in the LORD 3068 their God. 430

17:15 And they rejected 3988-4 his statutes, 2706 and his covenant 1285 that he made 3772-1 with their fathers, 1 and his testimonies 5715 which he testified 5749-52 against them; and they followed 3212-4 310 vanity, 1892 and became vain, 1891-4 and went after 310 the heathen 1471 that [were] round about 5439 them, [concerning] whom the LORD 3068 had charged 6680-14 them, that they should not do 6213-2 like them.

17:16 And they left 5800-4 all the commandments 4687 of the LORD 3068 their God, 430 and made 6213-4 them molten images, 4541 [even] two 8147 calves, 5695 and made 6213-4 a grove, 842 and worshipped 7812-101 all the host 6635 of heaven, 8064 and served 5647-4 Baal. 1168

17:17 And they caused their sons 1121 and their daughters 1323 to pass 5674-55 through the fire, 784 and used 7080-4 divination 7081 and enchantments, 5172-17 and sold 4376-101 themselves to do 6213-2 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 to provoke him to anger. 3707-53

17:18 Therefore the LORD 3068 was very 3966 angry 599-101 with Israel, 3478 and removed 5493-55 them out of his sight: 6440 there was none left 7604-8 but the tribe 7626 of Judah 3063 only.

17:19 Also Judah 3063 kept 8104-1 not the commandments 4687 of the LORD 3068 their God, 430 but walked 3212-4 in the statutes 2708 of Israel 3478 which they made. 6213-1

17:20 And the LORD 3068 rejected 3988-4 all the seed 2233 of Israel, 3478 and afflicted 6031-17 them, and delivered 5414-4 them into the hand 3027 of spoilers, 8154-6 until he had cast 7993-52 them out of his sight. 6440

17:21 For he rent 7167-1 Israel 3478 from the house 1004 of David; 1732 and they made Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat 5028 king: 4427-55 and Jeroboam 3379 drave 5080-55|5077-55-k Israel 3478 from following 310 the LORD, 3068 and made them sin 2398-52 a great 1419 sin. 2401

17:22 For the children 1121 of Israel 3478 walked 3212-4 in all the sins 2403 of Jeroboam 3379 which he did; 6213-1 they departed 5493-1 not from them;

17:23 Until the LORD 3068 removed 5493-52 Israel 3478 out of his sight, 6440 as he had said 1696-14 by 3027 all his servants 5650 the prophets. 5030 So was Israel 3478 carried away 1540-4 out of their own land 127 to Assyria 804 unto this day. 3117

17:24 And the king 4428 of Assyria 804 brought 935-55 [men] from Babylon, 894 and from Cuthah, 3575 and from Ava, 5755 and from Hamath, 2574 and from Sepharvaim, 5617 and placed 3427-55 [them] in the cities 5892 of Samaria 8111 instead of the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 and they possessed 3423-4 Samaria, 8111 and dwelt 3427-4 in the cities 5892 thereof.

17:25 And [so] it was at the beginning 8462 of their dwelling 3427-2 there, [that] they feared 3372-1 not the LORD: 3068 therefore the LORD 3068 sent 7971-17 lions 738 among them, which slew 2026-6 [some] of them.

17:26 Wherefore they spake 559-4 to the king 4428 of Assyria, 804 saying, 559-2 The nations 1471 which thou hast removed, 1540-52 and placed 3427-55 in the cities 5892 of Samaria, 8111 know 3045-1 not the manner 4941 of the God 430 of the land: 776 therefore he hath sent 7971-17 lions 738 among them, and, behold, they slay 4191-56 them, because they know 3045-6 not the manner 4941 of the God 430 of the land. 776

17:27 Then the king 4428 of Assyria 804 commanded, 6680-17 saying, 559-2 Carry 3212-54 thither one 259 of the priests 3548 whom ye brought 1540-52 from thence; and let them go 3212-4 and dwell 3427-4 there, and let him teach 3384-55 them the manner 4941 of the God 430 of the land. 776

17:28 Then one 259 of the priests 3548 whom they had carried away 1540-52 from Samaria 8111 came 935-4 and dwelt 3427-4 in Bethel, 1008 and taught 3384-56 them how they should fear 3372-4 the LORD. 3068

17:29 Howbeit every nation 1471 1471 made 6213-6 gods 430 of their own, and put 3240-55 [them] in the houses 1004 of the high places 1116 which the Samaritans 8118 had made, 6213-1 every nation 1471 1471 in their cities 5892 wherein they dwelt. 3427-6

17:30 And the men 582 of Babylon 894 made 6213-1 Succothbenoth, 5524 and the men 582 of Cuth 3575 made 6213-1 Nergal, 5370 and the men 582 of Hamath 2574 made 6213-1 Ashima, 807

17:31 And the Avites 5761 made 6213-1 Nibhaz 5026 and Tartak, 8662 and the Sepharvites 5616 burnt 8313-6 their children 1121 in fire 784 to Adrammelech 152 and Anammelech, 6048 the gods 430 of Sepharvaim. 5617

17:32 So they feared 3373 the LORD, 3068 and made 6213-4 unto themselves of the lowest 7098 of them priests 3548 of the high places, 1116 which sacrificed 6213-6 for them in the houses 1004 of the high places. 1116

17:33 They feared 3373 the LORD, 3068 and served 5647-6 their own gods, 430 after the manner 4941 of the nations 1471 whom they carried away 1540-52 from thence.

17:34 Unto this day 3117 they do 6213-6 after the former 7223 manners: 4941 they fear 3373 not the LORD, 3068 neither do 6213-6 they after their statutes, 2708 or after their ordinances, 4941 or after the law 8451 and commandment 4687 which the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 the children 1121 of Jacob, 3290 whom he named 7760-1 8034 Israel; 3478

17:35 With whom the LORD 3068 had made 3772-4 a covenant, 1285 and charged 6680-17 them, saying, 559-2 Ye shall not fear 3372-4 other 312 gods, 430 nor bow 7812-101 yourselves to them, nor serve 5647-4 them, nor sacrifice 2076-4 to them:

17:36 But the LORD, 3068 who brought you up 5927-52 out of the land 776 of Egypt 4714 with great 1419 power 3581 and a stretched out 5186-7 arm, 2220 him shall ye fear, 3372-4 and him shall ye worship, 7812-101 and to him shall ye do sacrifice. 2076-4

17:37 And the statutes, 2706 and the ordinances, 4941 and the law, 8451 and the commandment, 4687 which he wrote 3789-1 for you, ye shall observe 8104-4 to do 6213-2 for evermore; 3605 3117 and ye shall not fear 3372-4 other 312 gods. 430

17:38 And the covenant 1285 that I have made 3772-1 with you ye shall not forget; 7911-4 neither shall ye fear 3372-4 other 312 gods. 430

17:39 But the LORD 3068 your God 430 ye shall fear; 3372-4 and he shall deliver 5337-55 you out of the hand 3027 of all your enemies. 341-6

17:40 Howbeit they did not hearken, 8085-1 but they did 6213-6 after their former 7223 manner. 4941

17:41 So these nations 1471 feared 3373 the LORD, 3068 and served 5647-6 their graven images, 6456 both their children, 1121 and their children's 1121 children: 1121 as did 6213-1 their fathers, 1 so do 6213-6 they unto this day. 3117

18:1 Now it came to pass in the third 7969 year 8141 of Hoshea 1954 son 1121 of Elah 425 king 4428 of Israel, 3478 [that] Hezekiah 2396 the son 1121 of Ahaz 271 king 4428 of Judah 3063 began to reign. 4427-1

18:2 Twenty 6242 and five 2568 years 8141 old 1121 was he when he began to reign; 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 twenty 6242 and nine 8672 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 His mother's 517 name 8034 also [was] Abi, 21 the daughter 1323 of Zachariah. 2148

18:3 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] right 3477 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 according to all that David 1732 his father 1 did. 6213-1

18:4 He removed 5493-52 the high places, 1116 and brake 7665-14 the images, 4676 and cut down 3772-1 the groves, 842 and brake in pieces 3807-14 the brasen 5178 serpent 5175 that Moses 4872 had made: 6213-1 for unto those days 3117 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did burn incense 6999-18 to it: and he called 7121-4 it Nehushtan. 5180

18:5 He trusted 982-1 in the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel; 3478 so that after 310 him was none like him among all the kings 4428 of Judah, 3063 nor [any] that were before 6440 him.

18:6 For he clave 1692-4 to the LORD, 3068 [and] departed 5493-1 not from following 310 him, but kept 8104-4 his commandments, 4687 which the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

18:7 And the LORD 3068 was with him; [and] he prospered 7919-55 whithersoever he went forth: 3318-4 and he rebelled 4775-4 against the king 4428 of Assyria, 804 and served 5647-1 him not.

18:8 He smote 5221-52 the Philistines, 6430 [even] unto Gaza, 5804 and the borders 1366 thereof, from the tower 4026 of the watchmen 5341-6 to the fenced 4013 city. 5892

18:9 And it came to pass in the fourth 7243 year 8141 of king 4428 Hezekiah, 2396 which [was] the seventh 7637 year 8141 of Hoshea 1954 son 1121 of Elah 425 king 4428 of Israel, 3478 [that] Shalmaneser 8022 king 4428 of Assyria 804 came up 5927-1 against Samaria, 8111 and besieged 6696-4 it.

18:10 And at the end 7097 of three 7969 years 8141 they took 3920-4 it: [even] in the sixth 8337 year 8141 of Hezekiah, 2396 that [is] the ninth 8672 year 8141 of Hoshea 1954 king 4428 of Israel, 3478 Samaria 8111 was taken. 3920-8

18:11 And the king 4428 of Assyria 804 did carry away 1540-55 Israel 3478 unto Assyria, 804 and put 5148-55 them in Halah 2477 and in Habor 2249 [by] the river 5104 of Gozan, 1470 and in the cities 5892 of the Medes: 4074

18:12 Because they obeyed 8085-1 not the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 their God, 430 but transgressed 5674-4 his covenant, 1285 [and] all that Moses 4872 the servant 5650 of the LORD 3068 commanded, 6680-14 and would not hear 8085-1 [them], nor do 6213-1 [them].

18:13 Now in the fourteenth 702 6240 year 8141 of king 4428 Hezekiah 2396 did Sennacherib 5576 king 4428 of Assyria 804 come up 5927-1 against all the fenced 1219-7 cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 and took 8610-4 them.

18:14 And Hezekiah 2396 king 4428 of Judah 3063 sent 7971-4 to the king 4428 of Assyria 804 to Lachish, 3923 saying, 559-2 I have offended; 2398-1 return 7725-3 from me: that which thou puttest 5414-4 on me will I bear. 5375-4 And the king 4428 of Assyria 804 appointed 7760-4 unto Hezekiah 2396 king 4428 of Judah 3063 three 7969 hundred 3967 talents 3603 of silver 3701 and thirty 7970 talents 3603 of gold. 2091

18:15 And Hezekiah 2396 gave 5414-4 [him] all the silver 3701 that was found 4672-12 in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and in the treasures 214 of the king's 4428 house. 1004

18:16 At that time 6256 did Hezekiah 2396 cut off 7112-14 [the gold from] the doors 1817 of the temple 1964 of the LORD, 3068 and [from] the pillars 547 which Hezekiah 2396 king 4428 of Judah 3063 had overlaid, 6823-14 and gave 5414-4 it to the king 4428 of Assyria. 804

18:17 And the king 4428 of Assyria 804 sent 7971-4 Tartan 8661 and Rabsaris 7249 and Rabshakeh 7262 from Lachish 3923 to king 4428 Hezekiah 2396 with a great 3515 host 2426 against Jerusalem. 3389 And they went up 5927-4 and came 935-4 to Jerusalem. 3389 And when they were come up, 5927-4 they came 935-4 and stood 5975-4 by the conduit 8585 of the upper 5945 pool, 1295 which [is] in the highway 4546 of the fuller's 3526-5 field. 7704

18:18 And when they had called 7121-4 to the king, 4428 there came out 3318-4 to them Eliakim 471 the son 1121 of Hilkiah, 2518 which [was] over the household, 1004 and Shebna 7644 the scribe, 5608-6 and Joah 3098 the son 1121 of Asaph 623 the recorder. 2142-56

18:19 And Rabshakeh 7262 said 559-4 unto them, Speak 559-3 ye now to Hezekiah, 2396 Thus saith 559-1 the great 1419 king, 4428 the king 4428 of Assyria, 804 What confidence 986 [is] this wherein thou trustest? 982-1

18:20 Thou sayest, 559-1 (but [they are but] vain 8193 words,) 1697 [I have] counsel 6098 and strength 1369 for the war. 4421 Now on whom dost thou trust, 982-1 that thou rebellest 4775-1 against me?

18:21 Now, behold, thou trustest 982-1 upon the staff 4938 of this bruised 7533-7 reed, 7070 [even] upon Egypt, 4714 on which if a man 376 lean, 5564-11 it will go 935-1 into his hand, 3709 and pierce 5344-1 it: so [is] Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt 4714 unto all that trust 982-6 on him.

18:22 But if ye say 559-4 unto me, We trust 982-1 in the LORD 3068 our God: 430 [is] not that he, whose high places 1116 and whose altars 4196 Hezekiah 2396 hath taken away, 5493-52 and hath said 559-4 to Judah 3063 and Jerusalem, 3389 Ye shall worship 7812-101 before 6440 this altar 4196 in Jerusalem? 3389

18:23 Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges 6148-100 to my lord 113 the king 4428 of Assyria, 804 and I will deliver 5414-4 thee two thousand 505 horses, 5483 if thou be able 3201-4 on thy part to set 5414-2 riders 7392-6 upon them.

18:24 How then wilt thou turn away 7725-55 the face 6440 of one 259 captain 6346 of the least 6996 of my master's 113 servants, 5650 and put thy trust 982-4 on Egypt 4714 for chariots 7393 and for horsemen? 6571

18:25 Am I now come up 5927-1 without 1107 the LORD 3068 against this place 4725 to destroy 7843-53 it? The LORD 3068 said 559-1 to me, Go up 5927-3 against this land, 776 and destroy 7843-54 it.

18:26 Then said 559-4 Eliakim 471 the son 1121 of Hilkiah, 2518 and Shebna, 7644 and Joah, 3098 unto Rabshakeh, 7262 Speak, 1696-16 I pray thee, to thy servants 5650 in the Syrian 762 language; for we understand 8085-6 [it]: and talk 1696-17 not with us in the Jews' language 3066 in the ears 241 of the people 5971 that [are] on the wall. 2346

18:27 But Rabshakeh 7262 said 559-4 unto them, Hath my master 113 sent 7971-1 me to thy master, 113 and to thee, to speak 1696-15 these words? 1697 [hath he] not [sent me] to the men 582 which sit 3427-6 on the wall, 2346 that they may eat 398-2 their own dung, 6675|2755-k and drink 8354-2 their own piss 4325|7272|7890-k with you?

18:28 Then Rabshakeh 7262 stood 5975-4 and cried 7121-4 with a loud 1419 voice 6963 in the Jews' language, 3066 and spake, 1696-17 saying, 559-4 Hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the great 1419 king, 4428 the king 4428 of Assyria: 804

18:29 Thus saith 559-1 the king, 4428 Let not Hezekiah 2396 deceive 5377-55 you: for he shall not be able 3201-4 to deliver 5337-53 you out of his hand: 3027

18:30 Neither let Hezekiah 2396 make you trust 982-55 in the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 The LORD 3068 will surely 5337-53 deliver 5337-55 us, and this city 5892 shall not be delivered 5414-11 into the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Assyria. 804

18:31 Hearken 8085-4 not to Hezekiah: 2396 for thus saith 559-1 the king 4428 of Assyria, 804 Make 6213-3 [an agreement] with me by a present, 1293 and come out 3318-3 to me, and [then] eat 398-3 ye every man 376 of his own vine, 1612 and every one 376 of his fig tree, 8384 and drink 8354-3 ye every one 376 the waters 4325 of his cistern: 953

18:32 Until I come 935-2 and take you away 3947-1 to a land 776 like your own land, 776 a land 776 of corn 1715 and wine, 8492 a land 776 of bread 3899 and vineyards, 3754 a land 776 of oil 3323 olive 2132 and of honey, 1706 that ye may live, 2421-3 and not die: 4191-4 and hearken 8085-4 not unto Hezekiah, 2396 when he persuadeth 5496-55 you, saying, 559-2 The LORD 3068 will deliver 5337-55 us.

18:33 Hath any 376 of the gods 430 of the nations 1471 delivered 5337-52 at all 5337-53 his land 776 out of the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Assyria? 804

18:34 Where [are] the gods 430 of Hamath, 2574 and of Arpad? 774 where [are] the gods 430 of Sepharvaim, 5617 Hena, 2012 and Ivah? 5755 have they delivered 5337-52 Samaria 8111 out of mine hand? 3027

18:35 Who [are] they among all the gods 430 of the countries, 776 that have delivered 5337-52 their country 776 out of mine hand, 3027 that the LORD 3068 should deliver 5337-55 Jerusalem 3389 out of mine hand? 3027

18:36 But the people 5971 held their peace, 2790-52 and answered 6030-1 him not a word: 1697 for the king's 4428 commandment 4687 was, saying, 559-2 Answer 6030-4 him not.

18:37 Then came 935-4 Eliakim 471 the son 1121 of Hilkiah, 2518 which [was] over the household, 1004 and Shebna 7644 the scribe, 5608-6 and Joah 3098 the son 1121 of Asaph 623 the recorder, 2142-56 to Hezekiah 2396 with [their] clothes 899 rent, 7167-7 and told 5046-55 him the words 1697 of Rabshakeh. 7262

19:1 And it came to pass, when king 4428 Hezekiah 2396 heard 8085-2 [it], that he rent 7167-4 his clothes, 899 and covered 3680-101 himself with sackcloth, 8242 and went 935-4 into the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

19:2 And he sent 7971-4 Eliakim, 471 which [was] over the household, 1004 and Shebna 7644 the scribe, 5608-6 and the elders 2205 of the priests, 3548 covered 3680-102 with sackcloth, 8242 to Isaiah 3470 the prophet 5030 the son 1121 of Amoz. 531

19:3 And they said 559-4 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 Hezekiah, 2396 This day 3117 [is] a day 3117 of trouble, 6869 and of rebuke, 8433 and blasphemy: 5007 for the children 1121 are come 935-1 to the birth, 4866 and [there is] not strength 3581 to bring forth. 3205-2

19:4 It may be 194 the LORD 3068 thy God 430 will hear 8085-4 all the words 1697 of Rabshakeh, 7262 whom the king 4428 of Assyria 804 his master 113 hath sent 7971-1 to reproach 2778-15 the living 2416 God; 430 and will reprove 3198-52 the words 1697 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath heard: 8085-1 wherefore lift up 5375-1 [thy] prayer 8605 for the remnant 7611 that are left. 4672-12

19:5 So the servants 5650 of king 4428 Hezekiah 2396 came 935-4 to Isaiah. 3470

19:6 And Isaiah 3470 said 559-4 unto them, Thus shall ye say 559-4 to your master, 113 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Be not afraid 3372-4 of 6440 the words 1697 which thou hast heard, 8085-1 with which the servants 5288 of the king 4428 of Assyria 804 have blasphemed 1442-14 me.

19:7 Behold, I will send 5414-6 a blast 7307 upon him, and he shall hear 8085-1 a rumour, 8052 and shall return 7725-1 to his own land; 776 and I will cause him to fall 5307-52 by the sword 2719 in his own land. 776

19:8 So Rabshakeh 7262 returned, 7725-4 and found 4672-4 the king 4428 of Assyria 804 warring 3898-12 against Libnah: 3841 for he had heard 8085-1 that he was departed 5265-1 from Lachish. 3923

19:9 And when he heard 8085-4 say 559-2 of Tirhakah 8640 king 4428 of Ethiopia, 3568 Behold, he is come out 3318-1 to fight 3898-9 against thee: he sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 again 7725-4 unto Hezekiah, 2396 saying, 559-2

19:10 Thus shall ye speak 559-4 to Hezekiah 2396 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 saying, 559-2 Let not thy God 430 in whom thou trustest 982-6 deceive 5377-55 thee, saying, 559-2 Jerusalem 3389 shall not be delivered 5414-11 into the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Assyria. 804

19:11 Behold, thou hast heard 8085-1 what the kings 4428 of Assyria 804 have done 6213-1 to all lands, 776 by destroying them utterly: 2763-53 and shalt thou be delivered? 5337-11

19:12 Have the gods 430 of the nations 1471 delivered 5337-52 them which my fathers 1 have destroyed; 7843-14 [as] Gozan, 1470 and Haran, 2771 and Rezeph, 7530 and the children 1121 of Eden 5729 which [were] in Thelasar? 8515

19:13 Where [is] the king 4428 of Hamath, 2574 and the king 4428 of Arpad, 774 and the king 4428 of the city 5892 of Sepharvaim, 5617 of Hena, 2012 and Ivah? 5755

19:14 And Hezekiah 2396 received 3947-4 the letter 5612 of the hand 3027 of the messengers, 4397 and read 7121-4 it: and Hezekiah 2396 went up 5927-4 into the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and spread 6566-4 it before 6440 the LORD. 3068

19:15 And Hezekiah 2396 prayed 6419-101 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 O LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 which dwellest 3427-6 [between] the cherubims, 3742 thou art the God, 430 [even] thou alone, of all the kingdoms 4467 of the earth; 776 thou hast made 6213-1 heaven 8064 and earth. 776

19:16 LORD, 3068 bow down 5186-54 thine ear, 241 and hear: 8085-3 open, 6491-3 LORD, 3068 thine eyes, 5869 and see: 7200-3 and hear 8085-3 the words 1697 of Sennacherib, 5576 which hath sent 7971-1 him to reproach 2778-15 the living 2416 God. 430

19:17 Of a truth, 551 LORD, 3068 the kings 4428 of Assyria 804 have destroyed 2717-52 the nations 1471 and their lands, 776

19:18 And have cast 5414-1 their gods 430 into the fire: 784 for they [were] no gods, 430 but the work 4639 of men's 120 hands, 3027 wood 6086 and stone: 68 therefore they have destroyed 6-17 them.

19:19 Now therefore, O LORD 3068 our God, 430 I beseech thee, save 3467-54 thou us out of his hand, 3027 that all the kingdoms 4467 of the earth 776 may know 3045-4 that thou [art] the LORD 3068 God, 430 [even] thou only.

19:20 Then Isaiah 3470 the son 1121 of Amoz 531 sent 7971-4 to Hezekiah, 2396 saying, 559-2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 [That] which thou hast prayed 6419-98 to me against Sennacherib 5576 king 4428 of Assyria 804 I have heard. 8085-1

19:21 This [is] the word 1697 that the LORD 3068 hath spoken 1696-14 concerning him; The virgin 1330 the daughter 1323 of Zion 6726 hath despised 959-1 thee, [and] laughed thee to scorn; 3932-1 the daughter 1323 of Jerusalem 3389 hath shaken 5128-52 her head 7218 at 310 thee.

19:22 Whom hast thou reproached 2778-14 and blasphemed? 1442-14 and against whom hast thou exalted 7311-52 [thy] voice, 6963 and lifted up 5375-4 thine eyes 5869 on high? 4791 [even] against the Holy 6918 [One] of Israel. 3478

19:23 By 3027 thy messengers 4397 thou hast reproached 2778-14 the Lord, 136 and hast said, 559-4 With the multitude 7230|7393-q of my chariots 7393 I am come up 5927-1 to the height 4791 of the mountains, 2022 to the sides 3411 of Lebanon, 3844 and will cut down 3772-4 the tall 6967 cedar trees 730 thereof, [and] the choice 4004 fir trees 1265 thereof: and I will enter 935-4 into the lodgings 4411 of his borders, 7093 [and into] the forest 3293 of his Carmel. 3760

19:24 I have digged 6979-1 and drunk 8354-1 strange 2114-5 waters, 4325 and with the sole 3709 of my feet 6471 have I dried up 2717-55 all the rivers 2975 of besieged places. 4693|4692

19:25 Hast thou not heard 8085-1 long ago 7350 [how] I have done 6213-1 it, [and] of ancient 6924 times 3117 that I have formed 3335-1 it? now have I brought it to pass, 935-52 that thou shouldest be to lay waste 7582-53 fenced 1219-7 cities 5892 [into] ruinous 5327-12 heaps. 1530

19:26 Therefore their inhabitants 3427-6 were of small 7116 power, 3027 they were dismayed 2865-1 and confounded; 954-4 they were [as] the grass 6212 of the field, 7704 and [as] the green 3419 herb, 1877 [as] the grass 2682 on the housetops, 1406 and [as corn] blasted 7711 before 6440 it be grown up. 7054

19:27 But I know 3045-1 thy abode, 3427-2 and thy going out, 3318-2 and thy coming in, 935-2 and thy rage 7264-99 against me.

19:28 Because thy rage 7264-99 against me and thy tumult 7600 is come up 5927-1 into mine ears, 241 therefore I will put 7760-1 my hook 2397 in thy nose, 639 and my bridle 4964 in thy lips, 8193 and I will turn thee back 7725-52 by the way 1870 by which thou camest. 935-1

19:29 And this [shall be] a sign 226 unto thee, Ye shall eat 398-2 this year 8141 such things as grow of themselves, 5599 and in the second 8145 year 8141 that which springeth 7823 of the same; and in the third 7992 year 8141 sow 2232-3 ye, and reap, 7114-3 and plant 5193-3 vineyards, 3754 and eat 398-3 the fruits 6529 thereof.

19:30 And the remnant 7604-12 that is escaped 6413 of the house 1004 of Judah 3063 shall yet again 3254-1 take root 8328 downward, 4295 and bear 6213-1 fruit 6529 upward. 4605

19:31 For out of Jerusalem 3389 shall go forth 3318-4 a remnant, 7611 and they that escape 6413 out of mount 2022 Zion: 6726 the zeal 7068 of the LORD 3068 [of hosts] 6635-q shall do 6213-4 this.

19:32 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 concerning the king 4428 of Assyria, 804 He shall not come 935-4 into this city, 5892 nor shoot 3384-55 an arrow 2671 there, nor come before 6923-17 it with shield, 4043 nor cast 8210-4 a bank 5550 against it.

19:33 By the way 1870 that he came, 935-4 by the same shall he return, 7725-4 and shall not come 935-4 into this city, 5892 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

19:34 For I will defend 1598-1 this city, 5892 to save 3467-53 it, for mine own sake, and for my servant 5650 David's 1732 sake.

19:35 And it came to pass that night, 3915 that the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 went out, 3318-4 and smote 5221-55 in the camp 4264 of the Assyrians 804 an hundred 3967 fourscore 8084 and five 2568 thousand: 505 and when they arose early 7925-55 in the morning, 1242 behold, they [were] all dead 4191-5 corpses. 6297

19:36 So Sennacherib 5576 king 4428 of Assyria 804 departed, 5265-4 and went 3212-4 and returned, 7725-4 and dwelt 3427-4 at Nineveh. 5210

19:37 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping 7812-102 in the house 1004 of Nisroch 5268 his god, 430 that Adrammelech 152 and Sharezer 8272 his sons 1121 smote 5221-52 him with the sword: 2719 and they escaped 4422-8 into the land 776 of Armenia. 780 And Esarhaddon 634 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

20:1 In those days 3117 was Hezekiah 2396 sick 2470-1 unto death. 4191-2 And the prophet 5030 Isaiah 3470 the son 1121 of Amoz 531 came 935-4 to him, and said 559-4 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Set thine house 1004 in order; 6680-16 for thou shalt die, 4191-5 and not live. 2421-4

20:2 Then he turned 5437-55 his face 6440 to the wall, 7023 and prayed 6419-101 unto the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2

20:3 I beseech 577 thee, O LORD, 3068 remember 2142-3 now how I have walked 1980-98 before 6440 thee in truth 571 and with a perfect 8003 heart, 3824 and have done 6213-1 [that which is] good 2896 in thy sight. 5869 And Hezekiah 2396 wept 1058-4 sore. 1065 1419

20:4 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah 3470 was gone out 3318-1 into the middle 8484 court, 2691|5892-k that the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came to him, saying, 559-2

20:5 Turn again, 7725-3 and tell 559-1 Hezekiah 2396 the captain 5057 of my people, 5971 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 the God 430 of David 1732 thy father, 1 I have heard 8085-1 thy prayer, 8605 I have seen 7200-1 thy tears: 1832 behold, I will heal 7495-6 thee: on the third 7992 day 3117 thou shalt go up 5927-4 unto the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

20:6 And I will add 3254-52 unto thy days 3117 fifteen 2568 6240 years; 8141 and I will deliver 5337-55 thee and this city 5892 out of the hand 3709 of the king 4428 of Assyria; 804 and I will defend 1598-1 this city 5892 for mine own sake, and for my servant 5650 David's 1732 sake.

20:7 And Isaiah 3470 said, 559-4 Take 3947-3 a lump 1690 of figs. 8384 And they took 3947-4 and laid 7760-4 [it] on the boil, 7822 and he recovered. 2421-4

20:8 And Hezekiah 2396 said 559-4 unto Isaiah, 3470 What [shall be] the sign 226 that the LORD 3068 will heal 7495-4 me, and that I shall go up 5927-1 into the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 the third 7992 day? 3117

20:9 And Isaiah 3470 said, 559-4 This sign 226 shalt thou have of the LORD, 3068 that the LORD 3068 will do 6213-4 the thing 1697 that he hath spoken: 1696-14 shall the shadow 6738 go forward 1980-1 ten 6235 degrees, 4609 or go back 7725-4 ten 6235 degrees? 4609

20:10 And Hezekiah 3169 answered, 559-4 It is a light thing 7043-8 for the shadow 6738 to go down 5186-2 ten 6235 degrees: 4609 nay, but let the shadow 6738 return 7725-4 backward 322 ten 6235 degrees. 4609

20:11 And Isaiah 3470 the prophet 5030 cried 7121-4 unto the LORD: 3068 and he brought 7725-55 the shadow 6738 ten 6235 degrees 4609 backward, 322 by 4609 which it had gone down 3381-1 in the dial 4609 of Ahaz. 271

20:12 At that time 6256 Berodachbaladan, 1255 the son 1121 of Baladan, 1081 king 4428 of Babylon, 894 sent 7971-1 letters 5612 and a present 4503 unto Hezekiah: 2396 for he had heard 8085-1 that Hezekiah 2396 had been sick. 2470-1

20:13 And Hezekiah 2396 hearkened 8085-4 unto them, and shewed 7200-55 them all the house 1004 of his precious things, 5238 the silver, 3701 and the gold, 2091 and the spices, 1314 and the precious 2896 ointment, 8081 and [all] the house 1004 of his armour, 3627 and all that was found 4672-8 in his treasures: 214 there was nothing 1697 in his house, 1004 nor in all his dominion, 4475 that Hezekiah 2396 shewed 7200-52 them not.

20:14 Then came 935-4 Isaiah 3470 the prophet 5030 unto king 4428 Hezekiah, 2396 and said 559-4 unto him, What said 559-1 these men? 582 and from whence 370 came 935-4 they unto thee? And Hezekiah 2396 said, 559-4 They are come 935-1 from a far 7350 country, 776 [even] from Babylon. 894

20:15 And he said, 559-4 What have they seen 7200-1 in thine house? 1004 And Hezekiah 2396 answered, 559-4 All [the things] that [are] in mine house 1004 have they seen: 7200-1 there is nothing 1697 among my treasures 214 that I have not shewed 7200-52 them.

20:16 And Isaiah 3470 said 559-4 unto Hezekiah, 2396 Hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD. 3068

20:17 Behold, the days 3117 come, 935-6 that all that [is] in thine house, 1004 and that which thy fathers 1 have laid up in store 686-1 unto this day, 3117 shall be carried 5375-8 into Babylon: 894 nothing 1697 shall be left, 3498-11 saith 559-1 the LORD. 3068

20:18 And of thy sons 1121 that shall issue 3318-4 from thee, which thou shalt beget, 3205-55 shall they take away; 3947-4 and they shall be eunuchs 5631 in the palace 1964 of the king 4428 of Babylon. 894

20:19 Then said 559-4 Hezekiah 2396 unto Isaiah, 3470 Good 2896 [is] the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 which thou hast spoken. 1696-14 And he said, 559-4 [Is it] not [good], if peace 7965 and truth 571 be in my days? 3117

20:20 And the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Hezekiah, 2396 and all his might, 1369 and how he made 6213-1 a pool, 1295 and a conduit, 8585 and brought 935-55 water 4325 into the city, 5892 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Judah? 3063

20:21 And Hezekiah 2396 slept 7901-4 with his fathers: 1 and Manasseh 4519 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

21:1 Manasseh 4519 [was] twelve 8147 6240 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and reigned 4427-1 fifty 2572 and five 2568 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Hephzibah. 2657

21:2 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 after the abominations 8441 of the heathen, 1471 whom the LORD 3068 cast out 3423-52 before 6440 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

21:3 For he built up 1129-4 again 7725-4 the high places 1116 which Hezekiah 2396 his father 1 had destroyed; 6-14 and he reared up 6965-55 altars 4196 for Baal, 1168 and made 6213-4 a grove, 842 as did 6213-1 Ahab 256 king 4428 of Israel; 3478 and worshipped 7812-101 all the host 6635 of heaven, 8064 and served 5647-4 them.

21:4 And he built 1129-1 altars 4196 in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 of which the LORD 3068 said, 559-1 In Jerusalem 3389 will I put 7760-4 my name. 8034

21:5 And he built 1129-4 altars 4196 for all the host 6635 of heaven 8064 in the two 8147 courts 2691 of the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

21:6 And he made his son 1121 pass 5674-52 through the fire, 784 and observed times, 6049-22 and used enchantments, 5172-14 and dealt 6213-1 with familiar spirits 178 and wizards: 3049 he wrought 6213-2 much 7235-52 wickedness 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 to provoke [him] to anger. 3707-53

21:7 And he set 7760-4 a graven image 6459 of the grove 842 that he had made 6213-1 in the house, 1004 of which the LORD 3068 said 559-1 to David, 1732 and to Solomon 8010 his son, 1121 In this house, 1004 and in Jerusalem, 3389 which I have chosen 977-1 out of all tribes 7626 of Israel, 3478 will I put 7760-4 my name 8034 for ever: 5769

21:8 Neither will I make the feet 7272 of Israel 3478 move 5110-53 any more 3254-55 out of the land 127 which I gave 5414-1 their fathers; 1 only if they will observe 8104-4 to do 6213-2 according to all that I have commanded 6680-14 them, and according to all the law 8451 that my servant 5650 Moses 4872 commanded 6680-14 them.

21:9 But they hearkened 8085-1 not: and Manasseh 4519 seduced 8582-55 them to do 6213-2 more evil 7451 than did the nations 1471 whom the LORD 3068 destroyed 8045-52 before 6440 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

21:10 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 by 3027 his servants 5650 the prophets, 5030 saying, 559-2

21:11 Because Manasseh 4519 king 4428 of Judah 3063 hath done 6213-1 these abominations, 8441 [and] hath done wickedly 7489-52 above all that the Amorites 567 did, 6213-1 which [were] before 6440 him, and hath made Judah 3063 also to sin 2398-55 with his idols: 1544

21:12 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 Behold, I [am] bringing 935-56 [such] evil 7451 upon Jerusalem 3389 and Judah, 3063 that whosoever heareth 8085-6 of it, both 8147 his ears 241 shall tingle. 6750-4

21:13 And I will stretch 5186-1 over Jerusalem 3389 the line 6957 of Samaria, 8111 and the plummet 4949 of the house 1004 of Ahab: 256 and I will wipe 4229-1 Jerusalem 3389 as [a man] wipeth 4229-4 a dish, 6747 wiping 4229-1 [it], and turning 2015-1 [it] upside down. 6440

21:14 And I will forsake 5203-1 the remnant 7611 of mine inheritance, 5159 and deliver 5414-1 them into the hand 3027 of their enemies; 341-6 and they shall become a prey 957 and a spoil 4933 to all their enemies; 341-6

21:15 Because they have done 6213-1 [that which was] evil 7451 in my sight, 5869 and have provoked me to anger, 3707-56 since 4480 the day 3117 their fathers 1 came forth 3318-1 out of Egypt, 4714 even unto this day. 3117

21:16 Moreover Manasseh 4519 shed 8210-1 innocent 5355 blood 1818 very 3966 much, 7235-53 till he had filled 4390-14 Jerusalem 3389 from one end 6310 to another; 6310 beside his sin 2403 wherewith he made Judah 3063 to sin, 2398-52 in doing 6213-2 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD. 3068

21:17 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Manasseh, 4519 and all that he did, 6213-1 and his sin 2403 that he sinned, 2398-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Judah? 3063

21:18 And Manasseh 4519 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and was buried 6912-11 in the garden 1588 of his own house, 1004 in the garden 1588 of Uzza: 5798 and Amon 526 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

21:19 Amon 526 [was] twenty 6242 and two 8147 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 two 8147 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Meshullemeth, 4922 the daughter 1323 of Haruz 2743 of Jotbah. 3192

21:20 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 as his father 1 Manasseh 4519 did. 6213-1

21:21 And he walked 3212-4 in all the way 1870 that his father 1 walked in, 1980-1 and served 5647-4 the idols 1544 that his father 1 served, 5647-1 and worshipped 7812-101 them:

21:22 And he forsook 5800-4 the LORD 3068 God 430 of his fathers, 1 and walked 1980-1 not in the way 1870 of the LORD. 3068

21:23 And the servants 5650 of Amon 526 conspired 7194-4 against him, and slew 4191-55 the king 4428 in his own house. 1004

21:24 And the people 5971 of the land 776 slew 5221-55 all them that had conspired 7194-6 against king 4428 Amon; 526 and the people 5971 of the land 776 made Josiah 2977 his son 1121 king 4427-55 in his stead.

21:25 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Amon 526 which he did, 6213-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Judah? 3063

21:26 And he was buried 6912-4 in his sepulchre 6900 in the garden 1588 of Uzza: 5798 and Josiah 2977 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

22:1 Josiah 2977 [was] eight 8083 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 thirty 7970 and one 259 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Jedidah, 3040 the daughter 1323 of Adaiah 5718 of Boscath. 1218

22:2 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] right 3477 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 and walked 3212-4 in all the way 1870 of David 1732 his father, 1 and turned not aside 5493-1 to the right hand 3225 or to the left. 8040

22:3 And it came to pass in the eighteenth 8083 6240 year 8141 of king 4428 Josiah, 2977 [that] the king 4428 sent 7971-1 Shaphan 8227 the son 1121 of Azaliah, 683 the son 1121 of Meshullam, 4918 the scribe, 5608-6 to the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2

22:4 Go up 5927-3 to Hilkiah 2518 the high 1419 priest, 3548 that he may sum 8552-55 the silver 3701 which is brought into 935-94 the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 which the keepers 8104-6 of the door 5592 have gathered 622-1 of the people: 5971

22:5 And let them deliver 5414-4 it into the hand 3027 of the doers 6213-6 of the work, 4399 that have the oversight 6485-94 of the house 1004 of the LORD: 3068 and let them give 5414-4 it to the doers 6213-6 of the work 4399 which [is] in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 to repair 2388-15 the breaches 919 of the house, 1004

22:6 Unto carpenters, 2796 and builders, 1129-6 and masons, 1443-6 and to buy 7069-2 timber 6086 and hewn 4274 stone 68 to repair 2388-15 the house. 1004

22:7 Howbeit there was no reckoning made 2803-11 with them of the money 3701 that was delivered 5414-12 into their hand, 3027 because they dealt 6213-6 faithfully. 530

22:8 And Hilkiah 2518 the high 1419 priest 3548 said 559-4 unto Shaphan 8227 the scribe, 5608-6 I have found 4672-1 the book 5612 of the law 8451 in the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068 And Hilkiah 2518 gave 5414-4 the book 5612 to Shaphan, 8227 and he read 7121-4 it.

22:9 And Shaphan 8227 the scribe 5608-6 came 935-4 to the king, 4428 and brought the king 4428 word 1697 again, 7725-55 and said, 559-4 Thy servants 5650 have gathered 5413-52 the money 3701 that was found 4672-12 in the house, 1004 and have delivered 5414-4 it into the hand 3027 of them that do 6213-6 the work, 4399 that have the oversight 6485-94 of the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

22:10 And Shaphan 8227 the scribe 5608-6 shewed 5046-55 the king, 4428 saying, 559-2 Hilkiah 2518 the priest 3548 hath delivered 5414-1 me a book. 5612 And Shaphan 8227 read 7121-4 it before 6440 the king. 4428

22:11 And it came to pass, when the king 4428 had heard 8085-2 the words 1697 of the book 5612 of the law, 8451 that he rent 7167-4 his clothes. 899

22:12 And the king 4428 commanded 6680-17 Hilkiah 2518 the priest, 3548 and Ahikam 296 the son 1121 of Shaphan, 8227 and Achbor 5907 the son 1121 of Michaiah, 4320 and Shaphan 8227 the scribe, 5608-6 and Asahiah 6222 a servant 5650 of the king's, 4428 saying, 559-2

22:13 Go 3212-3 ye, enquire 1875-3 of the LORD 3068 for me, and for the people, 5971 and for all Judah, 3063 concerning the words 1697 of this book 5612 that is found: 4672-12 for great 1419 [is] the wrath 2534 of the LORD 3068 that is kindled 3341-8 against us, because our fathers 1 have not hearkened 8085-1 unto the words 1697 of this book, 5612 to do 6213-2 according unto all that which is written 3789-7 concerning us.

22:14 So Hilkiah 2518 the priest, 3548 and Ahikam, 296 and Achbor, 5907 and Shaphan, 8227 and Asahiah, 6222 went 3212-4 unto Huldah 2468 the prophetess, 5031 the wife 802 of Shallum 7967 the son 1121 of Tikvah, 8616 the son 1121 of Harhas, 2745 keeper 8104-6 of the wardrobe; 899 (now she dwelt 3427-6 in Jerusalem 3389 in the college;) 4932 and they communed 1696-17 with her.

22:15 And she said 559-4 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 Tell 559-3 the man 376 that sent 7971-1 you to me,

22:16 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Behold, I will bring 935-56 evil 7451 upon this place, 4725 and upon the inhabitants 3427-6 thereof, [even] all the words 1697 of the book 5612 which the king 4428 of Judah 3063 hath read: 7121-1

22:17 Because they have forsaken 5800-1 me, and have burned incense 6999-17 unto other 312 gods, 430 that they might provoke me to anger 3707-53 with all the works 4639 of their hands; 3027 therefore my wrath 2534 shall be kindled 3341-8 against this place, 4725 and shall not be quenched. 3518-4

22:18 But to the king 4428 of Judah 3063 which sent 7971-6 you to enquire 1875-2 of the LORD, 3068 thus shall ye say 559-4 to him, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 [As touching] the words 1697 which thou hast heard; 8085-1

22:19 Because thine heart 3824 was tender, 7401-1 and thou hast humbled 3665-11 thyself before 6440 the LORD, 3068 when thou heardest 8085-2 what I spake 1696-14 against this place, 4725 and against the inhabitants 3427-6 thereof, that they should become a desolation 8047 and a curse, 7045 and hast rent 7167-4 thy clothes, 899 and wept 1058-4 before 6440 me; I also have heard 8085-1 [thee], saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

22:20 Behold therefore, I will gather 622-6 thee unto thy fathers, 1 and thou shalt be gathered 622-8 into thy grave 6913 in peace; 7965 and thine eyes 5869 shall not see 7200-4 all the evil 7451 which I will bring 935-56 upon this place. 4725 And they brought the king 4428 word 1697 again. 7725-55

23:1 And the king 4428 sent, 7971-4 and they gathered 622-4 unto him all the elders 2205 of Judah 3063 and of Jerusalem. 3389

23:2 And the king 4428 went up 5927-4 into the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and all the men 376 of Judah 3063 and all the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem 3389 with him, and the priests, 3548 and the prophets, 5030 and all the people, 5971 both small 6996 and great: 1419 and he read 7121-4 in their ears 241 all the words 1697 of the book 5612 of the covenant 1285 which was found 4672-12 in the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

23:3 And the king 4428 stood 5975-4 by a pillar, 5982 and made 3772-4 a covenant 1285 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 to walk 3212-2 after 310 the LORD, 3068 and to keep 8104-2 his commandments 4687 and his testimonies 5715 and his statutes 2708 with all [their] heart 3820 and all [their] soul, 5315 to perform 6965-53 the words 1697 of this covenant 1285 that were written 3789-7 in this book. 5612 And all the people 5971 stood 5975-4 to the covenant. 1285

23:4 And the king 4428 commanded 6680-17 Hilkiah 2518 the high 1419 priest, 3548 and the priests 3548 of the second order, 4932 and the keepers 8104-6 of the door, 5592 to bring forth 3318-53 out of the temple 1964 of the LORD 3068 all the vessels 3627 that were made 6213-7 for Baal, 1168 and for the grove, 842 and for all the host 6635 of heaven: 8064 and he burned 8313-4 them without 2351 Jerusalem 3389 in the fields 7709 of Kidron, 6939 and carried 5375-1 the ashes 6083 of them unto Bethel. 1008

23:5 And he put down 7673-52 the idolatrous priests, 3649 whom the kings 4428 of Judah 3063 had ordained 5414-1 to burn incense 6999-17 in the high places 1116 in the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 and in the places round about 4524 Jerusalem; 3389 them also that burned incense 6999-18 unto Baal, 1168 to the sun, 8121 and to the moon, 3394 and to the planets, 4208 and to all the host 6635 of heaven. 8064

23:6 And he brought out 3318-55 the grove 842 from the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 without 2351 Jerusalem, 3389 unto the brook 5158 Kidron, 6939 and burned 8313-4 it at the brook 5158 Kidron, 6939 and stamped [it] small 1854-55 to powder, 6083 and cast 7993-55 the powder 6083 thereof upon the graves 6913 of the children 1121 of the people. 5971

23:7 And he brake down 5422-4 the houses 1004 of the sodomites, 6945 that [were] by the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 where the women 802 wove 707-6 hangings 1004 for the grove. 842

23:8 And he brought 935-55 all the priests 3548 out of the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 and defiled 2930-17 the high places 1116 where the priests 3548 had burned incense, 6999-14 from Geba 1387 to Beersheba, 884 and brake down 5422-1 the high places 1116 of the gates 8179 that [were] in the entering in 6607 of the gate 8179 of Joshua 3091 the governor 8269 of the city, 5892 which [were] on a man's 376 left hand 8040 at the gate 8179 of the city. 5892

23:9 Nevertheless the priests 3548 of the high places 1116 came not up 5927-4 to the altar 4196 of the LORD 3068 in Jerusalem, 3389 but they did eat 398-1 of the unleavened bread 4682 among 8432 their brethren. 251

23:10 And he defiled 2930-14 Topheth, 8612 which [is] in the valley 1516 of the children 1121|1121-k of Hinnom, 2011 that no man 376 might make his son 1121 or his daughter 1323 to pass 5674-53 through the fire 784 to Molech. 4432

23:11 And he took away 7673-55 the horses 5483 that the kings 4428 of Judah 3063 had given 5414-1 to the sun, 8121 at the entering in 935-2 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 by the chamber 3957 of Nathanmelech 5419 the chamberlain, 5631 which [was] in the suburbs, 6503 and burned 8313-1 the chariots 4818 of the sun 8121 with fire. 784

23:12 And the altars 4196 that [were] on the top 1406 of the upper chamber 5944 of Ahaz, 271 which the kings 4428 of Judah 3063 had made, 6213-1 and the altars 4196 which Manasseh 4519 had made 6213-1 in the two 8147 courts 2691 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 did the king 4428 beat down, 5422-1 and brake [them] down 7323-4 from thence, and cast 7993-52 the dust 6083 of them into the brook 5158 Kidron. 6939

23:13 And the high places 1116 that [were] before 6440 Jerusalem, 3389 which [were] on the right hand 3225 of the mount 2022 of corruption, 4889 which Solomon 8010 the king 4428 of Israel 3478 had builded 1129-1 for Ashtoreth 6253 the abomination 8251 of the Zidonians, 6722 and for Chemosh 3645 the abomination 8251 of the Moabites, 4124 and for Milcom 4445 the abomination 8441 of the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 did the king 4428 defile. 2930-14

23:14 And he brake 7665-14 in pieces the images, 4676 and cut down 3772-4 the groves, 842 and filled 4390-17 their places 4725 with the bones 6106 of men. 120

23:15 Moreover the altar 4196 that [was] at Bethel, 1008 [and] the high place 1116 which Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 who made Israel 3478 to sin, 2398-52 had made, 6213-1 both that altar 4196 and the high place 1116 he brake down, 5422-1 and burned 8313-4 the high place, 1116 [and] stamped [it] small 1854-52 to powder, 6083 and burned 8313-1 the grove. 842

23:16 And as Josiah 2977 turned 6437-4 himself, he spied 7200-4 the sepulchres 6913 that [were] there in the mount, 2022 and sent, 7971-4 and took 3947-4 the bones 6106 out of the sepulchres, 6913 and burned 8313-4 [them] upon the altar, 4196 and polluted 2930-17 it, according to the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 which the man 376 of God 430 proclaimed, 7121-1 who proclaimed 7121-1 these words. 1697

23:17 Then he said, 559-4 What title 6725 [is] that 1975 that I see? 7200-6 And the men 582 of the city 5892 told 559-4 him, [It is] the sepulchre 6913 of the man 376 of God, 430 which came 935-1 from Judah, 3063 and proclaimed 7121-4 these things 1697 that thou hast done 6213-1 against the altar 4196 of Bethel. 1008

23:18 And he said, 559-4 Let him alone; 3240-54 let no man 376 move 5128-55 his bones. 6106 So they let his bones 6106 alone, 4422-17 with the bones 6106 of the prophet 5030 that came 935-1 out of Samaria. 8111

23:19 And all the houses 1004 also of the high places 1116 that [were] in the cities 5892 of Samaria, 8111 which the kings 4428 of Israel 3478 had made 6213-1 to provoke [the LORD] to anger, 3707-53 Josiah 2977 took away, 5493-52 and did 6213-4 to them according to all the acts 4639 that he had done 6213-1 in Bethel. 1008

23:20 And he slew 2076-4 all the priests 3548 of the high places 1116 that [were] there upon the altars, 4196 and burned 8313-4 men's 120 bones 6106 upon them, and returned 7725-4 to Jerusalem. 3389

23:21 And the king 4428 commanded 6680-17 all the people, 5971 saying, 559-2 Keep 6213-3 the passover 6453 unto the LORD 3068 your God, 430 as [it is] written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of this covenant. 1285

23:22 Surely there was not holden 6213-8 such a passover 6453 from the days 3117 of the judges 8199-6 that judged 8199-1 Israel, 3478 nor in all the days 3117 of the kings 4428 of Israel, 3478 nor of the kings 4428 of Judah; 3063

23:23 But in the eighteenth 8083 6240 year 8141 of king 4428 Josiah, 2977 [wherein] this passover 6453 was holden 6213-8 to the LORD 3068 in Jerusalem. 3389

23:24 Moreover the [workers with] familiar spirits, 178 and the wizards, 3049 and the images, 8655 and the idols, 1544 and all the abominations 8251 that were spied 7200-8 in the land 776 of Judah 3063 and in Jerusalem, 3389 did Josiah 2977 put away, 1197-14 that he might perform 6965-53 the words 1697 of the law 8451 which were written 3789-7 in the book 5612 that Hilkiah 2518 the priest 3548 found 4672-1 in the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

23:25 And like unto him was there no king 4428 before 6440 him, that turned 7725-1 to the LORD 3068 with all his heart, 3824 and with all his soul, 5315 and with all his might, 3966 according to all the law 8451 of Moses; 4872 neither after 310 him arose 6965-1 there [any] like him.

23:26 Notwithstanding the LORD 3068 turned 7725-1 not from the fierceness 2740 of his great 1419 wrath, 639 wherewith his anger 639 was kindled 2734-1 against Judah, 3063 because of all the provocations 3708 that Manasseh 4519 had provoked 3707-52 him withal.

23:27 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 I will remove 5493-55 Judah 3063 also out of my sight, 6440 as I have removed 5493-52 Israel, 3478 and will cast off 3988-1 this city 5892 Jerusalem 3389 which I have chosen, 977-1 and the house 1004 of which I said, 559-1 My name 8034 shall be there.

23:28 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Josiah, 2977 and all that he did, 6213-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Judah? 3063

23:29 In his days 3117 Pharaohnechoh 6549 king 4428 of Egypt 4714 went up 5927-1 against the king 4428 of Assyria 804 to the river 5104 Euphrates: 6578 and king 4428 Josiah 2977 went 3212-4 against 7125-2 him; and he slew 4191-55 him at Megiddo, 4023 when he had seen 7200-2 him.

23:30 And his servants 5650 carried 7392-55 him in a chariot dead 4191-5 from Megiddo, 4023 and brought 935-55 him to Jerusalem, 3389 and buried 6912-4 him in his own sepulchre. 6900 And the people 5971 of the land 776 took 3947-4 Jehoahaz 3059 the son 1121 of Josiah, 2977 and anointed 4886-4 him, and made him king 4427-55 in his father's 1 stead.

23:31 Jehoahaz 3059 [was] twenty 6242 and three 7969 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign; 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 three 7969 months 2320 in Jerusalem. 3389 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Hamutal, 2537 the daughter 1323 of Jeremiah 3414 of Libnah. 3841

23:32 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 according to all that his fathers 1 had done. 6213-1

23:33 And Pharaohnechoh 6549 put him in bands 631-4 at Riblah 7247 in the land 776 of Hamath, 2574 that he might not reign 4427-2 in Jerusalem; 3389 and put 5414-4 the land 776 to a tribute 6066 of an hundred 3967 talents 3603 of silver, 3701 and a talent 3603 of gold. 2091

23:34 And Pharaohnechoh 6549 made Eliakim 471 the son 1121 of Josiah 2977 king 4427-55 in the room of Josiah 2977 his father, 1 and turned 5437-55 his name 8034 to Jehoiakim, 3079 and took Jehoahaz 3059 away: 3947-1 and he came 935-4 to Egypt, 4714 and died 4191-4 there.

23:35 And Jehoiakim 3079 gave 5414-1 the silver 3701 and the gold 2091 to Pharaoh; 6547 but he taxed 6186-52 the land 776 to give 5414-2 the money 3701 according to the commandment 6310 of Pharaoh: 6547 he exacted 5065-1 the silver 3701 and the gold 2091 of the people 5971 of the land, 776 of every one 376 according to his taxation, 6187 to give 5414-2 [it] unto Pharaohnechoh. 6549

23:36 Jehoiakim 3079 [was] twenty 6242 and five 2568 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign; 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 eleven 259 6240 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Zebudah, 2080 the daughter 1323 of Pedaiah 6305 of Rumah. 7316

23:37 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 according to all that his fathers 1 had done. 6213-1

24:1 In his days 3117 Nebuchadnezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 came up, 5927-1 and Jehoiakim 3079 became his servant 5650 three 7969 years: 8141 then he turned 7725-4 and rebelled 4775-4 against him.

24:2 And the LORD 3068 sent 7971-17 against him bands 1416 of the Chaldees, 3778 and bands 1416 of the Syrians, 758 and bands 1416 of the Moabites, 4124 and bands 1416 of the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 and sent 7971-17 them against Judah 3063 to destroy 6-53 it, according to the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 which he spake 1696-14 by 3027 his servants 5650 the prophets. 5030

24:3 Surely at the commandment 6310 of the LORD 3068 came [this] upon Judah, 3063 to remove 5493-53 [them] out of his sight, 6440 for the sins 2403 of Manasseh, 4519 according to all that he did; 6213-1

24:4 And also for the innocent 5355 blood 1818 that he shed: 8210-1 for he filled 4390-17 Jerusalem 3389 with innocent 5355 blood; 1818 which the LORD 3068 would 14-1 not pardon. 5545-2

24:5 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Jehoiakim, 3079 and all that he did, 6213-1 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the chronicles 1697 3117 of the kings 4428 of Judah? 3063

24:6 So Jehoiakim 3079 slept 7901-4 with his fathers: 1 and Jehoiachin 3078 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

24:7 And the king 4428 of Egypt 4714 came 3318-2 not again 3254-52 any more out of his land: 776 for the king 4428 of Babylon 894 had taken 3947-1 from the river 5158 of Egypt 4714 unto the river 5104 Euphrates 6578 all that pertained to the king 4428 of Egypt. 4714

24:8 Jehoiachin 3078 [was] eighteen 8083 6240 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 in Jerusalem 3389 three 7969 months. 2320 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Nehushta, 5179 the daughter 1323 of Elnathan 494 of Jerusalem. 3389

24:9 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 according to all that his father 1 had done. 6213-1

24:10 At that time 6256 the servants 5650 of Nebuchadnezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 came up 5927-1 against Jerusalem, 3389 and the city 5892 was besieged. 935-4 4692

24:11 And Nebuchadnezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 came 935-4 against the city, 5892 and his servants 5650 did besiege 6696-6 it.

24:12 And Jehoiachin 3078 the king 4428 of Judah 3063 went out 3318-4 to the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 he, and his mother, 517 and his servants, 5650 and his princes, 8269 and his officers: 5631 and the king 4428 of Babylon 894 took 3947-4 him in the eighth 8083 year 8141 of his reign. 4427-2

24:13 And he carried out 3318-55 thence all the treasures 214 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and the treasures 214 of the king's 4428 house, 1004 and cut in pieces 7112-17 all the vessels 3627 of gold 2091 which Solomon 8010 king 4428 of Israel 3478 had made 6213-1 in the temple 1964 of the LORD, 3068 as the LORD 3068 had said. 1696-14

24:14 And he carried away 1540-52 all Jerusalem, 3389 and all the princes, 8269 and all the mighty men 1368 of valour, 2428 [even] ten 6235 thousand 505 captives, 1540-6 and all the craftsmen 2796 and smiths: 4525 none remained, 7604-8 save 2108 the poorest sort 1803 of the people 5971 of the land. 776

24:15 And he carried away 1540-55 Jehoiachin 3078 to Babylon, 894 and the king's 4428 mother, 517 and the king's 4428 wives, 802 and his officers, 5631 and the mighty 352|193-k of the land, 776 [those] carried 3212-52 he into captivity 1473 from Jerusalem 3389 to Babylon. 894

24:16 And all the men 582 of might, 2428 [even] seven 7651 thousand, 505 and craftsmen 2796 and smiths 4525 a thousand, 505 all [that were] strong 1368 [and] apt 6213-6 for war, 4421 even them the king 4428 of Babylon 894 brought 935-55 captive 1473 to Babylon. 894

24:17 And the king 4428 of Babylon 894 made Mattaniah 4983 his father's brother 1730 king 4427-55 in his stead, and changed 5437-55 his name 8034 to Zedekiah. 6667

24:18 Zedekiah 6667 [was] twenty 6242 and one 259 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 eleven 259 6240 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Hamutal, 2537 the daughter 1323 of Jeremiah 3414 of Libnah. 3841

24:19 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 according to all that Jehoiakim 3079 had done. 6213-1

24:20 For through the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 it came to pass in Jerusalem 3389 and Judah, 3063 until he had cast them out 7993-52 from his presence, 6440 that Zedekiah 6667 rebelled 4775-4 against the king 4428 of Babylon. 894

25:1 And it came to pass in the ninth 8671 year 8141 of his reign, 4427-2 in the tenth 6224 month, 2320 in the tenth 6218 [day] of the month, 2320 [that] Nebuchadnezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 came, 935-1 he, and all his host, 2428 against Jerusalem, 3389 and pitched 2583-4 against it; and they built 1129-4 forts 1785 against it round about. 5439

25:2 And the city 5892 was besieged 935-4 4692 unto the eleventh 6249 6240 year 8141 of king 4428 Zedekiah. 6667

25:3 And on the ninth 8672 [day] of the [fourth] month 2320 the famine 7458 prevailed 2388-4 in the city, 5892 and there was no bread 3899 for the people 5971 of the land. 776

25:4 And the city 5892 was broken up, 1234-11 and all the men 582 of war 4421 [fled] by night 3915 by the way 1870 of the gate 8179 between two walls, 2346 which [is] by the king's 4428 garden: 1588 (now the Chaldees 3778 [were] against the city 5892 round about:) 5439 and [the king] went 3212-4 the way 1870 toward the plain. 6160

25:5 And the army 2428 of the Chaldees 3778 pursued 7291-4 after 310 the king, 4428 and overtook 5381-55 him in the plains 6160 of Jericho: 3405 and all his army 2428 were scattered 6327-8 from him.

25:6 So they took 8610-4 the king, 4428 and brought him up 5927-55 to the king 4428 of Babylon 894 to Riblah; 7247 and they gave 1696-17 judgment 4941 upon him.

25:7 And they slew 7819-1 the sons 1121 of Zedekiah 6667 before his eyes, 5869 and put out 5786-14 the eyes 5869 of Zedekiah, 6667 and bound 631-4 him with fetters of brass, 5178 and carried 935-55 him to Babylon. 894

25:8 And in the fifth 2549 month, 2320 on the seventh 7651 [day] of the month, 2320 which [is] the 8141 nineteenth 8672 6240 year 8141 of king 4428 Nebuchadnezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon, 894 came 935-1 Nebuzaradan, 5018 captain 7227 of the guard, 2876 a servant 5650 of the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 unto Jerusalem: 3389

25:9 And he burnt 8313-4 the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and the king's 4428 house, 1004 and all the houses 1004 of Jerusalem, 3389 and every great 1419 [man's] house 1004 burnt 8313-1 he with fire. 784

25:10 And all the army 2428 of the Chaldees, 3778 that [were with] the captain 7227 of the guard, 2876 brake down 5422-1 the walls 2346 of Jerusalem 3389 round about. 5439

25:11 Now the rest 3499 of the people 5971 [that were] left 7604-12 in the city, 5892 and the fugitives 5307-6 that fell away 5307-1 to the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 with the remnant 3499 of the multitude, 1995 did Nebuzaradan 5018 the captain 7227 of the guard 2876 carry away. 1540-52

25:12 But the captain 7227 of the guard 2876 left 7604-52 of the poor 1803 of the land 776 [to be] vinedressers 3755 and husbandmen. 3009-6|1461-5-k

25:13 And the pillars 5982 of brass 5178 that [were] in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and the bases, 4350 and the brasen 5178 sea 3220 that [was] in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 did the Chaldees 3778 break in pieces, 7665-14 and carried 5375-4 the brass 5178 of them to Babylon. 894

25:14 And the pots, 5518 and the shovels, 3257 and the snuffers, 4212 and the spoons, 3709 and all the vessels 3627 of brass 5178 wherewith they ministered, 8334-17 took they away. 3947-1

25:15 And the firepans, 4289 and the bowls, 4219 [and] such things as [were] of gold, 2091 [in] gold, 2091 and of silver, 3701 [in] silver, 3701 the captain 7227 of the guard 2876 took away. 3947-1

25:16 The two 8147 pillars, 5982 one 259 sea, 3220 and the bases 4350 which Solomon 8010 had made 6213-1 for the house 1004 of the LORD; 3068 the brass 5178 of all these vessels 3627 was without 3808 weight. 4948

25:17 The height 6967 of the one 259 pillar 5982 [was] eighteen 8083 6240 cubits, 520 and the chapiter 3805 upon it [was] brass: 5178 and the height 6967 of the chapiter 3805 three 7969 cubits; 520 and the wreathen work, 7639 and pomegranates 7416 upon the chapiter 3805 round about, 5439 all of brass: 5178 and like unto these had the second 8145 pillar 5982 with wreathen work. 7639

25:18 And the captain 7227 of the guard 2876 took 3947-4 Seraiah 8304 the chief 7218 priest, 3548 and Zephaniah 6846 the second 4932 priest, 3548 and the three 7969 keepers 8104-6 of the door: 5592

25:19 And out of the city 5892 he took 3947-1 an 259 officer 5631 that was set 6496 over the men 582 of war, 4421 and five 2568 men 582 of them that were in 7200-6 the king's 4428 presence, 6440 which were found 4672-8 in the city, 5892 and the principal 8269 scribe 5608-6 of the host, 6635 which mustered 6633-56 the people 5971 of the land, 776 and threescore 8346 men 376 of the people 5971 of the land 776 [that were] found 4672-12 in the city: 5892

25:20 And Nebuzaradan 5018 captain 7227 of the guard 2876 took 3947-4 these, and brought 3212-55 them to the king 4428 of Babylon 894 to Riblah: 7247

25:21 And the king 4428 of Babylon 894 smote 5221-55 them, and slew 4191-55 them at Riblah 7247 in the land 776 of Hamath. 2574 So Judah 3063 was carried away 1540-4 out of their land. 127

25:22 And [as for] the people 5971 that remained 7604-12 in the land 776 of Judah, 3063 whom Nebuchadnezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon 894 had left, 7604-52 even over them he made Gedaliah 1436 the son 1121 of Ahikam, 296 the son 1121 of Shaphan, 8227 ruler. 6485-55

25:23 And when all the captains 8269 of the armies, 2428 they and their men, 582 heard 8085-4 that the king 4428 of Babylon 894 had made Gedaliah 1436 governor, 6485-52 there came 935-4 to Gedaliah 1436 to Mizpah, 4709 even Ishmael 3458 the son 1121 of Nethaniah, 5418 and Johanan 3110 the son 1121 of Careah, 7143 and Seraiah 8304 the son 1121 of Tanhumeth 8576 the Netophathite, 5200 and Jaazaniah 2970 the son 1121 of a Maachathite, 4602 they and their men. 582

25:24 And Gedaliah 1436 sware 7650-11 to them, and to their men, 582 and said 559-4 unto them, Fear 3372-4 not to be the servants 5650 of the Chaldees: 3778 dwell 3427-3 in the land, 776 and serve 5647-3 the king 4428 of Babylon; 894 and it shall be well 3190-4 with you.

25:25 But it came to pass in the seventh 7637 month, 2320 that Ishmael 3458 the son 1121 of Nethaniah, 5418 the son 1121 of Elishama, 476 of the seed 2233 royal, 4410 came, 935-1 and ten 6235 men 582 with him, and smote 5221-55 Gedaliah, 1436 that he died, 4191-4 and the Jews 3064 and the Chaldees 3778 that were with him at Mizpah. 4709

25:26 And all the people, 5971 both small 6996 and great, 1419 and the captains 8269 of the armies, 2428 arose, 6965-4 and came 935-4 to Egypt: 4714 for they were afraid 3372-1 of 6440 the Chaldees. 3778

25:27 And it came to pass in the seven 7651 and thirtieth 7970 year 8141 of the captivity 1546 of Jehoiachin 3078 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 in the twelfth 8147 6240 month, 2320 on the seven 7651 and twentieth 6242 [day] of the month, 2320 [that] Evilmerodach 192 king 4428 of Babylon 894 in the year 8141 that he began to reign 4427-2 did lift up 5375-1 the head 7218 of Jehoiachin 3078 king 4428 of Judah 3063 out of prison; 1004 3608

25:28 And he spake 1696-17 kindly 2896 to him, and set 5414-4 his throne 3678 above the throne 3678 of the kings 4428 that [were] with him in Babylon; 894

25:29 And changed 8132-14 his prison 3608 garments: 899 and he did eat 398-1 bread 3899 continually 8548 before 6440 him all the days 3117 of his life. 2416

25:30 And his allowance 737 [was] a continual 8548 allowance 737 given 5414-8 him of the king, 4428 a daily 3117 rate 1697 for every day, 3117 all the days 3117 of his life. 2416
