1:1 And Solomon 8010 the son 1121 of David 1732 was strengthened 2388-101 in his kingdom, 4438 and the LORD 3068 his God 430 [was] with him, and magnified 1431-17 him exceedingly. 4605

1:2 Then Solomon 8010 spake 559-4 unto all Israel, 3478 to the captains 8269 of thousands 505 and of hundreds, 3967 and to the judges, 8199-6 and to every governor 5387 in all Israel, 3478 the chief 7218 of the fathers. 1

1:3 So Solomon, 8010 and all the congregation 6951 with him, went 3212-4 to the high place 1116 that [was] at Gibeon; 1391 for there was the tabernacle 168 of the congregation 4150 of God, 430 which Moses 4872 the servant 5650 of the LORD 3068 had made 6213-1 in the wilderness. 4057

1:4 But 61 the ark 727 of God 430 had David 1732 brought up 5927-52 from Kirjathjearim 7157 to [the place which] David 1732 had prepared 3559-53 for it: for he had pitched 5186-1 a tent 168 for it at Jerusalem. 3389

1:5 Moreover the brasen 5178 altar, 4196 that Bezaleel 1212 the son 1121 of Uri, 221 the son 1121 of Hur, 2354 had made, 6213-1 he put 7760-1 before 6440 the tabernacle 4908 of the LORD: 3068 and Solomon 8010 and the congregation 6951 sought 1875-4 unto it.

1:6 And Solomon 8010 went up 5927-55 thither to the brasen 5178 altar 4196 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 which [was] at the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and offered 5927-55 a thousand 505 burnt offerings 5930 upon it.

1:7 In that night 3915 did God 430 appear 7200-8 unto Solomon, 8010 and said 559-4 unto him, Ask 7592-3 what I shall give 5414-4 thee.

1:8 And Solomon 8010 said 559-4 unto God, 430 Thou hast shewed 6213-1 great 1419 mercy 2617 unto David 1732 my father, 1 and hast made me to reign 4427-52 in his stead.

1:9 Now, O LORD 3068 God, 430 let thy promise 1697 unto David 1732 my father 1 be established: 539-11 for thou hast made me king 4427-52 over a people 5971 like the dust 6083 of the earth 776 in multitude. 7227

1:10 Give 5414-3 me now wisdom 2451 and knowledge, 4093 that I may go out 3318-4 and come in 935-4 before 6440 this people: 5971 for who can judge 8199-4 this thy people, 5971 [that is so] great? 1419

1:11 And God 430 said 559-4 to Solomon, 8010 Because this was in thine heart, 3824 and thou hast not asked 7592-1 riches, 6239 wealth, 5233 or honour, 3519 nor the life 5315 of thine enemies, 8130-6 neither yet hast asked 7592-1 long 7227 life; 3117 but hast asked 7592-4 wisdom 2451 and knowledge 4093 for thyself, that thou mayest judge 8199-4 my people, 5971 over whom I have made thee king: 4427-52

1:12 Wisdom 2451 and knowledge 4093 [is] granted 5414-7 unto thee; and I will give 5414-4 thee riches, 6239 and wealth, 5233 and honour, 3519 such as none of the kings 4428 have had that [have been] before 6440 thee, neither shall there any after 310 thee have the like.

1:13 Then Solomon 8010 came 935-4 [from his journey] to the high place 1116 that [was] at Gibeon 1391 to Jerusalem, 3389 from before 6440 the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and reigned 4427-4 over Israel. 3478

1:14 And Solomon 8010 gathered 622-4 chariots 7393 and horsemen: 6571 and he had a thousand 505 and four 702 hundred 3967 chariots, 7393 and twelve 8147 6240 thousand 505 horsemen, 6571 which he placed 3240-55 in the chariot 7393 cities, 5892 and with the king 4428 at Jerusalem. 3389

1:15 And the king 4428 made 5414-4 silver 3701 and gold 2091 at Jerusalem 3389 [as plenteous] as stones, 68 and cedar trees 730 made 5414-1 he as the sycomore trees 8256 that [are] in the vale 8219 for abundance. 7230

1:16 And Solomon 8010 had horses 5483 brought out 4161 of Egypt, 4714 and linen yarn: 4723 the king's 4428 merchants 5503-6 received 3947-4 the linen yarn 4723 at a price. 4242

1:17 And they fetched up, 5927-4 and brought forth 3318-55 out of Egypt 4714 a chariot 4818 for six 8337 hundred 3967 [shekels] of silver, 3701 and an horse 5483 for an hundred 3967 and fifty: 2572 and so brought they out 3318-55 [horses] for all the kings 4428 of the Hittites, 2850 and for the kings 4428 of Syria, 758 by their means. 3027

2:1 And Solomon 8010 determined 559-4 to build 1129-2 an house 1004 for the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 and an house 1004 for his kingdom. 4438

2:2 And Solomon 8010 told out 5608-4 threescore and ten 7657 thousand 505 men 376 to bear burdens, 5449 and fourscore 8084 thousand 505 376 to hew 2672-6 in the mountain, 2022 and three 7969 thousand 505 and six 8337 hundred 3967 to oversee 5329-18 them.

2:3 And Solomon 8010 sent 7971-4 to Huram 2361 the king 4428 of Tyre, 6865 saying, 559-2 As thou didst deal 6213-1 with David 1732 my father, 1 and didst send 7971-4 him cedars 730 to build 1129-2 him an house 1004 to dwell 3427-2 therein, [even so deal with me].

2:4 Behold, I build 1129-6 an house 1004 to the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 my God, 430 to dedicate 6942-53 [it] to him, [and] to burn 6999-53 before 6440 him sweet 5561 incense, 7004 and for the continual 8548 shewbread, 4635 and for the burnt offerings 5930 morning 1242 1242 and evening, 6153 on the sabbaths, 7676 and on the new moons, 2320 and on the solemn feasts 4150 of the LORD 3068 our God. 430 This [is an ordinance] for ever 5769 to Israel. 3478

2:5 And the house 1004 which I build 1129-6 [is] great: 1419 for great 1419 [is] our God 430 above all gods. 430

2:6 But who is 6113-4 able 3581 to build 1129-2 him an house, 1004 seeing the heaven 8064 and heaven 8064 of heavens 8064 cannot contain 3557-46 him? who [am] I then, that I should build 1129-4 him an house, 1004 save only 518 to burn sacrifice 6999-53 before 6440 him?

2:7 Send 7971-3 me now therefore a man 376 cunning 2450 to work 6213-2 in gold, 2091 and in silver, 3701 and in brass, 5178 and in iron, 1270 and in purple, 710 and crimson, 3758 and blue, 8504 and that can skill 3045-6 to grave 6605-15 6603 with the cunning men 2450 that [are] with me in Judah 3063 and in Jerusalem, 3389 whom David 1732 my father 1 did provide. 3559-52

2:8 Send 7971-3 me also cedar 730 trees, 6086 fir trees, 1265 and algum 418 trees, out of Lebanon: 3844 for I know 3045-1 that thy servants 5650 can skill 3045-6 to cut 3772-2 timber 6086 in Lebanon; 3844 and, behold, my servants 5650 [shall be] with thy servants, 5650

2:9 Even to prepare 3559-53 me timber 6086 in abundance: 7230 for the house 1004 which I am about to build 1129-6 [shall be] wonderful 6381-53 great. 1419

2:10 And, behold, I will give 5414-1 to thy servants, 5650 the hewers 2404-6 that cut 3772-6 timber, 6086 twenty 6242 thousand 505 measures 3734 of beaten 4347 wheat, 2406 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 measures 3734 of barley, 8184 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 baths 1324 of wine, 3196 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 baths 1324 of oil. 8081

2:11 Then Huram 2361 the king 4428 of Tyre 6865 answered 559-4 in writing, 3791 which he sent 7971-4 to Solomon, 8010 Because the LORD 3068 hath loved 160 his people, 5971 he hath made 5414-1 thee king 4428 over them.

2:12 Huram 2361 said 559-4 moreover, Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 that made 6213-1 heaven 8064 and earth, 776 who hath given 5414-1 to David 1732 the king 4428 a wise 2450 son, 1121 endued 3045-6 with prudence 7922 and understanding, 998 that might build 1129-4 an house 1004 for the LORD, 3068 and an house 1004 for his kingdom. 4438

2:13 And now I have sent 7971-1 a cunning 2450 man, 376 endued 3045-6 with understanding, 998 of Huram 2361 my father's, 1

2:14 The son 1121 of a woman 802 of the daughters 1323 of Dan, 1835 and his father 1 [was] a man 376 of Tyre, 6876 skilful 3045-6 to work 6213-2 in gold, 2091 and in silver, 3701 in brass, 5178 in iron, 1270 in stone, 68 and in timber, 6086 in purple, 713 in blue, 8504 and in fine linen, 948 and in crimson; 3758 also to grave 6605-15 any manner of graving, 6603 and to find out 2803-2 every device 4284 which shall be put 5414-11 to him, with thy cunning men, 2450 and with the cunning men 2450 of my lord 113 David 1732 thy father. 1

2:15 Now therefore the wheat, 2406 and the barley, 8184 the oil, 8081 and the wine, 3196 which my lord 113 hath spoken 559-1 of, let him send 7971-4 unto his servants: 5650

2:16 And we will cut 3772-4 wood 6086 out of Lebanon, 3844 as much as thou shalt need: 6878 and we will bring 935-55 it to thee in floats 7513 by sea 3220 to Joppa; 3305 and thou shalt carry it up 5927-55 to Jerusalem. 3389

2:17 And Solomon 8010 numbered 5608-4 all the strangers 582 1616 that [were] in the land 776 of Israel, 3478 after 310 the numbering 5610 wherewith David 1732 his father 1 had numbered 5608-1 them; and they were found 4672-11 an hundred 3967 and fifty 2572 thousand 505 and three 7969 thousand 505 and six 8337 hundred. 3967

2:18 And he set 6213-4 threescore and ten 7657 thousand 505 of them [to be] bearers of burdens, 5449 and fourscore 8084 thousand 505 [to be] hewers 2672-6 in the mountain, 2022 and three 7969 thousand 505 and six 8337 hundred 3967 overseers 5329-18 to set the people 5971 a work. 5647-53

3:1 Then Solomon 8010 began 2490-55 to build 1129-2 the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 at Jerusalem 3389 in mount 2022 Moriah, 4179 where [the LORD] appeared 7200-8 unto David 1732 his father, 1 in the place 4725 that David 1732 had prepared 3559-52 in the threshingfloor 1637 of Ornan 771 the Jebusite. 2983

3:2 And he began 2490-55 to build 1129-2 in the second 8145 [day] of the second 8145 month, 2320 in the fourth 702 year 8141 of his reign. 4438

3:3 Now these [are the things wherein] Solomon 8010 was instructed 3245-90 for the building 1129-2 of the house 1004 of God. 430 The length 753 by cubits 520 after the first 7223 measure 4060 [was] threescore 8346 cubits, 520 and the breadth 7341 twenty 6242 cubits. 520

3:4 And the porch 197 that [was] in the front 6440 [of the house], the length 753 [of it was] according to 6440 the breadth 7341 of the house, 1004 twenty 6242 cubits, 520 and the height 1363 [was] an hundred 3967 and twenty: 6242 and he overlaid 6823-17 it within 6441 with pure 2889 gold. 2091

3:5 And the greater 1419 house 1004 he cieled 2645-14 with fir 1265 tree, 6086 which he overlaid 2645-17 with fine 2896 gold, 2091 and set 5927-55 thereon palm trees 8561 and chains. 8333

3:6 And he garnished 6823-17 the house 1004 with precious 3368 stones 68 for beauty: 8597 and the gold 2091 [was] gold 2091 of Parvaim. 6516

3:7 He overlaid 2645-17 also the house, 1004 the beams, 6982 the posts, 5592 and the walls 7023 thereof, and the doors 1817 thereof, with gold; 2091 and graved 6605-14 cherubims 3742 on the walls. 7023

3:8 And he made 6213-4 the most 6944 holy 6944 house, 1004 the length 753 whereof [was] according to 6440 the breadth 7341 of the house, 1004 twenty 6242 cubits, 520 and the breadth 7341 thereof twenty 6242 cubits: 520 and he overlaid 2645-17 it with fine 2896 gold, 2091 [amounting] to six 8337 hundred 3967 talents. 3603

3:9 And the weight 4948 of the nails 4548 [was] fifty 2572 shekels 8255 of gold. 2091 And he overlaid 2645-14 the upper chambers 5944 with gold. 2091

3:10 And in the most 6944 holy 6944 house 1004 he made 6213-4 two 8147 cherubims 3742 of image 6816 work, 4639 and overlaid 6823-17 them with gold. 2091

3:11 And the wings 3671 of the cherubims 3742 [were] twenty 6242 cubits 520 long: 753 one 259 wing 3671 [of the one cherub was] five 2568 cubits, 520 reaching 5060-56 to the wall 7023 of the house: 1004 and the other 312 wing 3671 [was likewise] five 2568 cubits, 520 reaching 5060-56 to the wing 3671 of the other 312 cherub. 3742

3:12 And [one] wing 3671 of the other 259 cherub 3742 [was] five 2568 cubits, 520 reaching 5060-56 to the wall 7023 of the house: 1004 and the other 312 wing 3671 [was] five 2568 cubits 520 [also], joining 1695 to the wing 3671 of the other 312 cherub. 3742

3:13 The wings 3671 of these cherubims 3742 spread themselves forth 6566-6 twenty 6242 cubits: 520 and they stood 5975-6 on their feet, 7272 and their faces 6440 [were] inward. 1004

3:14 And he made 6213-4 the vail 6532 [of] blue, 8504 and purple, 713 and crimson, 3758 and fine linen, 948 and wrought 5927-55 cherubims 3742 thereon.

3:15 Also he made 6213-4 before 6440 the house 1004 two 8147 pillars 5982 of thirty 7970 and five 2568 cubits 520 high, 753 and the chapiter 6858 that [was] on the top 7218 of each of them [was] five 2568 cubits. 520

3:16 And he made 6213-4 chains, 8333 [as] in the oracle, 1687 and put 5414-4 [them] on the heads 7218 of the pillars; 5982 and made 6213-4 an hundred 3967 pomegranates, 7416 and put 5414-4 [them] on the chains. 8333

3:17 And he reared up 6965-55 the pillars 5982 before 6440 the temple, 1964 one 259 on the right hand, 3225 and the other 259 on the left; 8040 and called 7121-4 the name 8034 of that on the right hand 3233|3227-k Jachin, 3199 and the name 8034 of that on the left 8042 Boaz. 1162

4:1 Moreover he made 6213-4 an altar 4196 of brass, 5178 twenty 6242 cubits 520 the length 753 thereof, and twenty 6242 cubits 520 the breadth 7341 thereof, and ten 6235 cubits 520 the height 6967 thereof.

4:2 Also he made 6213-4 a molten 3332-94 sea 3220 of ten 6235 cubits 520 from brim 8193 to brim, 8193 round 5696 in compass, 5439 and five 2568 cubits 520 the height 6967 thereof; and a line 6957 of thirty 7970 cubits 520 did compass 5437-4 it round about. 5439

4:3 And under it [was] the similitude 1823 of oxen, 1241 which did compass 5437-6 it round about: 5439 5439 ten 6235 in a cubit, 520 compassing 5362-56 the sea 3220 round about. 5439 Two 8147 rows 2905 of oxen 1241 [were] cast, 3332-7 when it was cast. 4166

4:4 It stood 5975-6 upon twelve 8147 6240 oxen, 1241 three 7969 looking 6437-6 toward the north, 6828 and three 7969 looking 6437-6 toward the west, 3220 and three 7969 looking 6437-6 toward the south, 5045 and three 7969 looking 6437-6 toward the east: 4217 and the sea 3220 [was set] above 4605 upon them, and all their hinder parts 268 [were] inward. 1004

4:5 And the thickness 5672 of it [was] an handbreadth, 2947 and the brim 8193 of it like the work 4639 of the brim 8193 of a cup, 3563 with flowers 6525 of lilies; 7799 [and] it received 2388-56 and held 3557-55 three 7969 thousand 505 baths. 1324

4:6 He made 6213-4 also ten 6235 lavers, 3595 and put 5414-4 five 2568 on the right hand, 3225 and five 2568 on the left, 8040 to wash 7364-2 in them: such things as they offered 4639 for the burnt offering 5930 they washed 1740-55 in them; but the sea 3220 [was] for the priests 3548 to wash 7364-2 in.

4:7 And he made 6213-4 ten 6235 candlesticks 4501 of gold 2091 according to their form, 4941 and set 5414-4 [them] in the temple, 1964 five 2568 on the right hand, 3225 and five 2568 on the left. 8040

4:8 He made 6213-4 also ten 6235 tables, 7979 and placed 3240-55 [them] in the temple, 1964 five 2568 on the right side, 3225 and five 2568 on the left. 8040 And he made 6213-4 an hundred 3967 basons 4219 of gold. 2091

4:9 Furthermore he made 6213-4 the court 2691 of the priests, 3548 and the great 1419 court, 5835 and doors 1817 for the court, 5835 and overlaid 6823-14 the doors 1817 of them with brass. 5178

4:10 And he set 5414-1 the sea 3220 on the right 3233 side 3802 of the east end, 6924 over against 4136 the south. 5045

4:11 And Huram 2361 made 6213-4 the pots, 5518 and the shovels, 3257 and the basons. 4219 And Huram 2361|2438-q finished 3615-17 6213-2 the work 4399 that he was to make 6213-1 for king 4428 Solomon 8010 for the house 1004 of God; 430

4:12 [To wit], the two 8147 pillars, 5982 and the pommels, 1543 and the chapiters 3805 [which were] on the top 7218 of the two 8147 pillars, 5982 and the two 8147 wreaths 7639 to cover 3680-15 the two 8147 pommels 1543 of the chapiters 3805 which [were] on the top 7218 of the pillars; 5982

4:13 And four 702 hundred 3967 pomegranates 7416 on the two 8147 wreaths; 7639 two 8147 rows 2905 of pomegranates 7416 on each 259 wreath, 7639 to cover 3680-15 the two 8147 pommels 1543 of the chapiters 3805 which [were] upon 6440 the pillars. 5982

4:14 He made 6213-1 also bases, 4350 and lavers 3595 made 6213-1 he upon the bases; 4350

4:15 One 259 sea, 3220 and twelve 8147 6240 oxen 1241 under it.

4:16 The pots 5518 also, and the shovels, 3257 and the fleshhooks, 4207 and all their instruments, 3627 did Huram 2361 his father 1 make 6213-1 to king 4428 Solomon 8010 for the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 of bright 4838-7 brass. 5178

4:17 In the plain 3603 of Jordan 3383 did the king 4428 cast 3332-1 them, in the clay 5645 ground 127 between Succoth 5523 and Zeredathah. 6868

4:18 Thus Solomon 8010 made 6213-4 all these vessels 3627 in great 3966 abundance: 7230 for the weight 4948 of the brass 5178 could not be found out. 2713-8

4:19 And Solomon 8010 made 6213-4 all the vessels 3627 that [were for] the house 1004 of God, 430 the golden 2091 altar 4196 also, and the tables 7979 whereon the shewbread 3899 6440 [was set];

4:20 Moreover the candlesticks 4501 with their lamps, 5216 that they should burn 1197-15 after the manner 4941 before 6440 the oracle, 1687 of pure 5462-7 gold; 2091

4:21 And the flowers, 6525 and the lamps, 5216 and the tongs, 4457 [made he of] gold, 2091 [and] that perfect 4357 gold; 2091

4:22 And the snuffers, 4212 and the basons, 4219 and the spoons, 3709 and the censers, 4289 [of] pure 5462-7 gold: 2091 and the entry 6607 of the house, 1004 the inner 6442 doors 1817 thereof for the most 6944 holy 6944 [place], and the doors 1817 of the house 1004 of the temple, 1964 [were of] gold. 2091

5:1 Thus all the work 4399 that Solomon 8010 made 6213-1 for the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 was finished: 7999-4 and Solomon 8010 brought in 935-55 [all] the things that David 1732 his father 1 had dedicated; 6944 and the silver, 3701 and the gold, 2091 and all the instruments, 3627 put 5414-1 he among the treasures 214 of the house 1004 of God. 430

5:2 Then Solomon 8010 assembled 6950-55 the elders 2205 of Israel, 3478 and all the heads 7218 of the tribes, 4294 the chief 5387 of the fathers 1 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 unto Jerusalem, 3389 to bring up 5927-53 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 out of the city 5892 of David, 1732 which [is] Zion. 6726

5:3 Wherefore all the men 376 of Israel 3478 assembled 6950-11 themselves unto the king 4428 in the feast 2282 which [was] in the seventh 7637 month. 2320

5:4 And all the elders 2205 of Israel 3478 came; 935-4 and the Levites 3881 took up 5375-4 the ark. 727

5:5 And they brought up 5927-55 the ark, 727 and the tabernacle 168 of the congregation, 4150 and all the holy 6944 vessels 3627 that [were] in the tabernacle, 168 these did the priests 3548 [and] the Levites 3881 bring up. 5927-52

5:6 Also king 4428 Solomon, 8010 and all the congregation 5712 of Israel 3478 that were assembled 3259-12 unto him before 6440 the ark, 727 sacrificed 2076-18 sheep 6629 and oxen, 1241 which could not be told 5608-11 nor numbered 4487-11 for multitude. 7230

5:7 And the priests 3548 brought in 935-55 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 unto his place, 4725 to the oracle 1687 of the house, 1004 into the most 6944 holy 6944 [place, even] under the wings 3671 of the cherubims: 3742

5:8 For the cherubims 3742 spread forth 6566-6 [their] wings 3671 over the place 4725 of the ark, 727 and the cherubims 3742 covered 3680-17 the ark 727 and the staves 905 thereof above. 4605

5:9 And they drew out 748-55 the staves 905 [of the ark], that the ends 7218 of the staves 905 were seen 7200-11 from the ark 727 before 6440 the oracle; 1687 but they were not seen 7200-11 without. 2351 And there it is unto this day. 3117

5:10 [There was] nothing in the ark 727 save the two 8147 tables 3871 which Moses 4872 put 5414-1 [therein] at Horeb, 2722 when the LORD 3068 made 3772-1 [a covenant] with the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 when they came out 3318-2 of Egypt. 4714

5:11 And it came to pass, when the priests 3548 were come out 3318-2 of the holy 6944 [place]: (for all the priests 3548 [that were] present 4672-12 were sanctified, 6942-98 [and] did not [then] wait 8104-2 by course: 4256

5:12 Also the Levites 3881 [which were] the singers, 7891-35 all of them of Asaph, 623 of Heman, 1968 of Jeduthun, 3038 with their sons 1121 and their brethren, 251 [being] arrayed 3847-30 in white linen, 948 having cymbals 4700 and psalteries 5035 and harps, 3658 stood 5975-6 at the east end 4217 of the altar, 4196 and with them an hundred 3967 and twenty 6242 priests 3548 sounding 2690-56 with trumpets:) 2689

5:13 It came even to pass, as the trumpeters 2690-18|2690-18-k and singers 7891-35 [were] as one, 259 to make one 259 sound 6963 to be heard 8085-53 in praising 1984-15 and thanking 3034-53 the LORD; 3068 and when they lifted up 7311-53 [their] voice 6963 with the trumpets 2689 and cymbals 4700 and instruments 3627 of musick, 7892 and praised 1984-15 the LORD, 3068 [saying], For [he is] good; 2896 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever: 5769 that [then] the house 1004 was filled 4390-1 with a cloud, 6051 [even] the house 1004 of the LORD; 3068

5:14 So that the priests 3548 could 3201-1 not stand 5975-2 to minister 8334-15 by reason 6440 of the cloud: 6051 for the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 had filled 4390-1 the house 1004 of God. 430

6:1 Then said 559-1 Solomon, 8010 The LORD 3068 hath said 559-1 that he would dwell 7931-2 in the thick darkness. 6205

6:2 But I have built 1129-1 an house 1004 of habitation 2073 for thee, and a place 4349 for thy dwelling 3427-2 for ever. 5769

6:3 And the king 4428 turned 5437-55 his face, 6440 and blessed 1288-17 the whole congregation 6951 of Israel: 3478 and all the congregation 6951 of Israel 3478 stood. 5975-6

6:4 And he said, 559-4 Blessed 1288-7 [be] the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 who hath with his hands 3027 fulfilled 4390-14 [that] which he spake 1696-14 with his mouth 6310 to my father 1 David, 1732 saying, 559-2

6:5 Since the day 3117 that I brought forth 3318-52 my people 5971 out of the land 776 of Egypt 4714 I chose 977-1 no city 5892 among all the tribes 7626 of Israel 3478 to build 1129-2 an house 1004 in, that my name 8034 might be there; neither chose 977-1 I any man 376 to be a ruler 5057 over my people 5971 Israel: 3478

6:6 But I have chosen 977-4 Jerusalem, 3389 that my name 8034 might be there; and have chosen 977-4 David 1732 to be over my people 5971 Israel. 3478

6:7 Now it was in the heart 3824 of David 1732 my father 1 to build 1129-2 an house 1004 for the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel. 3478

6:8 But the LORD 3068 said 559-4 to David 1732 my father, 1 Forasmuch as it was in thine heart 3824 to build 1129-2 an house 1004 for my name, 8034 thou didst well 2895-52 in that it was in thine heart: 3824

6:9 Notwithstanding 7535 thou shalt not build 1129-4 the house; 1004 but thy son 1121 which shall come forth 3318-6 out of thy loins, 2504 he shall build 1129-4 the house 1004 for my name. 8034

6:10 The LORD 3068 therefore hath performed 6965-55 his word 1697 that he hath spoken: 1696-14 for I am risen up 6965-4 in the room of David 1732 my father, 1 and am set 3427-4 on the throne 3678 of Israel, 3478 as the LORD 3068 promised, 1696-14 and have built 1129-4 the house 1004 for the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel. 3478

6:11 And in it 8033 have I put 7760-4 the ark, 727 wherein [is] the covenant 1285 of the LORD, 3068 that he made 3772-1 with the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

6:12 And he stood 5975-4 before 6440 the altar 4196 of the LORD 3068 in the presence of all the congregation 6951 of Israel, 3478 and spread forth 6566-4 his hands: 3709

6:13 For Solomon 8010 had made 6213-1 a brasen 5178 scaffold, 3595 of five 2568 cubits 520 long, 753 and five 2568 cubits 520 broad, 7341 and three 7969 cubits 520 high, 6967 and had set 5414-4 it in the midst 8432 of the court: 5835 and upon it he stood, 5975-4 and kneeled down 1288-4 upon his knees 1290 before all the congregation 6951 of Israel, 3478 and spread forth 6566-4 his hands 3709 toward heaven, 8064

6:14 And said, 559-4 O LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 [there is] no God 430 like thee in the heaven, 8064 nor in the earth; 776 which keepest 8104-6 covenant, 1285 and [shewest] mercy 2617 unto thy servants, 5650 that walk 1980-6 before 6440 thee with all their hearts: 3820

6:15 Thou which hast kept 8104-1 with thy servant 5650 David 1732 my father 1 that which thou hast promised 1696-14 him; and spakest 1696-17 with thy mouth, 6310 and hast fulfilled 4390-14 [it] with thine hand, 3027 as [it is] this day. 3117

6:16 Now therefore, O LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 keep 8104-3 with thy servant 5650 David 1732 my father 1 that which thou hast promised 1696-14 him, saying, 559-2 There shall not fail 3772-11 thee a man 376 in my sight 6440 to sit 3427-6 upon the throne 3678 of Israel; 3478 yet so 7535 that thy children 1121 take heed 8104-4 to their way 1870 to walk 3212-2 in my law, 8451 as thou hast walked 1980-1 before 6440 me.

6:17 Now then, O LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 let thy word 1697 be verified, 539-11 which thou hast spoken 1696-14 unto thy servant 5650 David. 1732

6:18 But will God 430 in very deed 552 dwell 3427-4 with men 120 on the earth? 776 behold, heaven 8064 and the heaven 8064 of heavens 8064 cannot contain 3557-46 thee; how much less this house 1004 which I have built! 1129-1

6:19 Have respect 6437-1 therefore to the prayer 8605 of thy servant, 5650 and to his supplication, 8467 O LORD 3068 my God, 430 to hearken 8085-2 unto the cry 7440 and the prayer 8605 which thy servant 5650 prayeth 6419-102 before 6440 thee:

6:20 That thine eyes 5869 may be open 6605-7 upon this house 1004 day 3119 and night, 3915 upon the place 4725 whereof thou hast said 559-1 that thou wouldest put 7760-2 thy name 8034 there; to hearken 8085-2 unto the prayer 8605 which thy servant 5650 prayeth 6419-101 toward this place. 4725

6:21 Hearken 8085-1 therefore unto the supplications 8469 of thy servant, 5650 and of thy people 5971 Israel, 3478 which they shall make 6419-101 toward this place: 4725 hear 8085-4 thou from thy dwelling 3427-2 place, 4725 [even] from heaven; 8064 and when thou hearest, 8085-1 forgive. 5545-1

6:22 If a man 376 sin 2398-4 against his neighbour, 7453 and an oath 423 be laid 5375-1 upon him to make him swear, 422-53 and the oath 423 come 935-1 before 6440 thine altar 4196 in this house; 1004

6:23 Then hear 8085-4 thou from heaven, 8064 and do, 6213-1 and judge 8199-1 thy servants, 5650 by requiting 7725-53 the wicked, 7563 by recompensing 5414-2 his way 1870 upon his own head; 7218 and by justifying 6663-53 the righteous, 6662 by giving 5414-2 him according to his righteousness. 6666

6:24 And if thy people 5971 Israel 3478 be put to the worse 5062-11 before 6440 the enemy, 341-6 because they have sinned 2398-4 against thee; and shall return 7725-1 and confess 3034-52 thy name, 8034 and pray 6419-98 and make supplication 2603-98 before 6440 thee in this house; 1004

6:25 Then hear 8085-4 thou from the heavens, 8064 and forgive 5545-1 the sin 2403 of thy people 5971 Israel, 3478 and bring them again 7725-52 unto the land 127 which thou gavest 5414-1 to them and to their fathers. 1

6:26 When the heaven 8064 is shut up, 6113-9 and there is no rain, 4306 because they have sinned 2398-4 against thee; [yet] if they pray 6419-98 toward this place, 4725 and confess 3034-52 thy name, 8034 and turn 7725-4 from their sin, 2403 when thou dost afflict 6031-55 them;

6:27 Then hear 8085-4 thou from heaven, 8064 and forgive 5545-1 the sin 2403 of thy servants, 5650 and of thy people 5971 Israel, 3478 when thou hast taught 3384-55 them the good 2896 way, 1870 wherein they should walk; 3212-4 and send 5414-1 rain 4306 upon thy land, 776 which thou hast given 5414-1 unto thy people 5971 for an inheritance. 5159

6:28 If there be dearth 7458 in the land, 776 if there be pestilence, 1698 if there be blasting, 7711 or mildew, 3420 locusts, 697 or caterpillers; 2625 if their enemies 341-6 besiege 6887-55 them in the cities 8179 of their land; 776 whatsoever sore 5061 or whatsoever sickness 4245 [there be]:

6:29 [Then] what prayer 8605 [or] what supplication 8467 soever shall be made of any man, 120 or of all thy people 5971 Israel, 3478 when every one 376 shall know 3045-4 his own sore 5061 and his own grief, 4341 and shall spread forth 6566-1 his hands 3709 in this house: 1004

6:30 Then hear 8085-4 thou from heaven 8064 thy dwelling 3427-2 place, 4349 and forgive, 5545-1 and render 5414-1 unto every man 376 according unto all his ways, 1870 whose heart 3824 thou knowest; 3045-4 (for thou only knowest 3045-1 the hearts 3824 of the children 1121 of men:) 120

6:31 That they may fear 3372-4 thee, to walk 3212-2 in thy ways, 1870 so long as 3117 they live 2416 in 6440 the land 127 which thou gavest 5414-1 unto our fathers. 1

6:32 Moreover concerning the stranger, 5237 which is not of thy people 5971 Israel, 3478 but is come 935-1 from a far 7350 country 776 for thy great 1419 name's 8034 sake, and thy mighty 2389 hand, 3027 and thy stretched out 5186-7 arm; 2220 if they come 935-1 and pray 6419-98 in this house; 1004

6:33 Then hear 8085-4 thou from the heavens, 8064 [even] from thy dwelling 3427-2 place, 4349 and do 6213-1 according to all that the stranger 5237 calleth 7121-4 to thee for; that all people 5971 of the earth 776 may know 3045-4 thy name, 8034 and fear 3372-2 thee, as [doth] thy people 5971 Israel, 3478 and may know 3045-2 that this house 1004 which I have built 1129-1 is called 7121-8 by thy name. 8034

6:34 If thy people 5971 go out 3318-4 to war 4421 against their enemies 341-6 by the way 1870 that thou shalt send 7971-4 them, and they pray 6419-98 unto thee toward 1870 this city 5892 which thou hast chosen, 977-1 and the house 1004 which I have built 1129-1 for thy name; 8034

6:35 Then hear 8085-1 thou from the heavens 8064 their prayer 8605 and their supplication, 8467 and maintain 6213-1 their cause. 4941

6:36 If they sin 2398-4 against thee, (for [there is] no man 120 which sinneth 2398-4 not,) and thou be angry 599-1 with them, and deliver 5414-1 them over before 6440 [their] enemies, 341-6 and they carry them away 7617-1 captives 7617-6 unto a land 776 far off 7350 or near; 7138

6:37 Yet [if] they bethink 7725-52 3824 themselves in the land 776 whither they are carried captive, 7617-8 and turn 7725-1 and pray 2603-98 unto thee in the land 776 of their captivity, 7628 saying, 559-2 We have sinned, 2398-1 we have done amiss, 5753-52 and have dealt wickedly; 7561-1

6:38 If they return 7725-1 to thee with all their heart 3820 and with all their soul 5315 in the land 776 of their captivity, 7628 whither they have carried them captives, 7617-1 and pray 6419-98 toward 1870 their land, 776 which thou gavest 5414-1 unto their fathers, 1 and [toward] the city 5892 which thou hast chosen, 977-1 and toward the house 1004 which I have built 1129-1 for thy name: 8034

6:39 Then hear 8085-1 thou from the heavens, 8064 [even] from thy dwelling 3427-2 place, 4349 their prayer 8605 and their supplications, 8467 and maintain 6213-1 their cause, 4941 and forgive 5545-1 thy people 5971 which have sinned 2398-1 against thee.

6:40 Now, my God, 430 let, I beseech thee, thine eyes 5869 be open, 6605-7 and [let] thine ears 241 [be] attent 7183 unto the prayer 8605 [that is made] in this place. 4725

6:41 Now therefore arise, 6965-3 O LORD 3068 God, 430 into thy resting 5118 place, thou, and the ark 727 of thy strength: 5797 let thy priests, 3548 O LORD 3068 God, 430 be clothed 3847-4 with salvation, 8668 and let thy saints 2623 rejoice 8055-4 in goodness. 2896

6:42 O LORD 3068 God, 430 turn not away 7725-55 the face 6440 of thine anointed: 4899 remember 2142-3 the mercies 2617 of David 1732 thy servant. 5650

7:1 Now when Solomon 8010 had made an end 3615-15 of praying, 6419-99 the fire 784 came down 3381-1 from heaven, 8064 and consumed 398-4 the burnt offering 5930 and the sacrifices; 2077 and the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 filled 4390-1 the house. 1004

7:2 And the priests 3548 could 3201-1 not enter 935-2 into the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 because the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 had filled 4390-1 the LORD'S 3068 house. 1004

7:3 And when all the children 1121 of Israel 3478 saw 7200-6 how the fire 784 came down, 3381-2 and the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 upon the house, 1004 they bowed 3766-4 themselves with their faces 639 to the ground 776 upon the pavement, 7531 and worshipped, 7812-101 and praised 3034-53 the LORD, 3068 [saying], For [he is] good; 2896 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

7:4 Then the king 4428 and all the people 5971 offered 2076-6 sacrifices 2077 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

7:5 And king 4428 Solomon 8010 offered 2076-4 a sacrifice 2077 of twenty 6242 and two 8147 thousand 505 oxen, 1241 and an hundred 3967 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 sheep: 6629 so the king 4428 and all the people 5971 dedicated 2596-4 the house 1004 of God. 430

7:6 And the priests 3548 waited 5975-6 on their offices: 4931 the Levites 3881 also with instruments 3627 of musick 7892 of the LORD, 3068 which David 1732 the king 4428 had made 6213-1 to praise 3034-53 the LORD, 3068 because his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever, 5769 when David 1732 praised 1984-15 by their ministry; 3027 and the priests 3548 sounded 2690-56|2690-18-k trumpets before them, and all Israel 3478 stood. 5975-6

7:7 Moreover Solomon 8010 hallowed 6942-17 the middle 8432 of the court 2691 that [was] before 6440 the house 1004 of the LORD: 3068 for there he offered 6213-1 burnt offerings, 5930 and the fat 2459 of the peace offerings, 8002 because the brasen 5178 altar 4196 which Solomon 8010 had made 6213-1 was not able 3201-1 to receive 3557-53 the burnt offerings, 5930 and the meat offerings, 4503 and the fat. 2459

7:8 Also at the same time 6256 Solomon 8010 kept 6213-4 the feast 2282 seven 7651 days, 3117 and all Israel 3478 with him, a very 3966 great 1419 congregation, 6951 from the entering in 935-2 of Hamath 2574 unto the river 5158 of Egypt. 4714

7:9 And in the eighth 8066 day 3117 they made 6213-4 a solemn assembly: 6116 for they kept 6213-1 the dedication 2598 of the altar 4196 seven 7651 days, 3117 and the feast 2282 seven 7651 days. 3117

7:10 And on the three 7969 and twentieth 6242 day 3117 of the seventh 7637 month 2320 he sent the people 5971 away 7971-14 into their tents, 168 glad 8056 and merry 2896 in heart 3820 for the goodness 2896 that the LORD 3068 had shewed 6213-1 unto David, 1732 and to Solomon, 8010 and to Israel 3478 his people. 5971

7:11 Thus Solomon 8010 finished 3615-17 the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and the king's 4428 house: 1004 and all that came 935-6 into Solomon's 8010 heart 3820 to make 6213-2 in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and in his own house, 1004 he prosperously effected. 6743-52

7:12 And the LORD 3068 appeared 7200-11 to Solomon 8010 by night, 3915 and said 559-4 unto him, I have heard 8085-1 thy prayer, 8605 and have chosen 977-1 this place 4725 to myself for an house 1004 of sacrifice. 2077

7:13 If 2005 I shut up 6113-4 heaven 8064 that there be no rain, 4306 or if I command 6680-17 the locusts 2284 to devour 398-2 the land, 776 or if 2005 I send 7971-17 pestilence 1698 among my people; 5971

7:14 If my people, 5971 which are called 7121-8 by my name, 8034 shall humble 3665-11 themselves, and pray, 6419-101 and seek 1245-17 my face, 6440 and turn 7725-4 from their wicked 7451 ways; 1870 then will I hear 8085-4 from heaven, 8064 and will forgive 5545-4 their sin, 2403 and will heal 7495-4 their land. 776

7:15 Now mine eyes 5869 shall be open, 6605-7 and mine ears 241 attent 7183 unto the prayer 8605 [that is made] in this place. 4725

7:16 For now have I chosen 977-1 and sanctified 6942-52 this house, 1004 that my name 8034 may be there for 5704 ever: 5769 and mine eyes 5869 and mine heart 3820 shall be there perpetually. 3605 3117

7:17 And as for thee, if thou wilt walk 3212-4 before 6440 me, as David 1732 thy father 1 walked, 1980-1 and do 6213-2 according to all that I have commanded 6680-14 thee, and shalt observe 8104-4 my statutes 2706 and my judgments; 4941

7:18 Then will I stablish 6965-52 the throne 3678 of thy kingdom, 4438 according as I have covenanted 3772-1 with David 1732 thy father, 1 saying, 559-2 There shall not fail 3772-11 thee a man 376 [to be] ruler 4910-6 in Israel. 3478

7:19 But if ye turn away, 7725-4 and forsake 5800-1 my statutes 2708 and my commandments, 4687 which I have set 5414-1 before 6440 you, and shall go 1980-1 and serve 5647-1 other 312 gods, 430 and worship 7812-98 them;

7:20 Then will I pluck them up by the roots 5428-1 out of my land 127 which I have given 5414-1 them; and this house, 1004 which I have sanctified 6942-52 for my name, 8034 will I cast out 7993-55 of my sight, 6440 and will make 5414-4 it [to be] a proverb 4912 and a byword 8148 among all nations. 5971

7:21 And this house, 1004 which is high, 5945 shall be an astonishment 8074-4 to every one that passeth 5674-6 by it; so that he shall say, 559-1 Why hath the LORD 3068 done 6213-1 thus unto this land, 776 and unto this house? 1004

7:22 And it shall be answered, 559-1 Because they forsook 5800-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of their fathers, 1 which brought them forth 3318-52 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 and laid hold 2388-55 on other 312 gods, 430 and worshipped 7812-101 them, and served 5647-4 them: therefore hath he brought 935-52 all this evil 7451 upon them.

8:1 And it came to pass at the end 7093 of twenty 6242 years, 8141 wherein Solomon 8010 had built 1129-1 the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and his own house, 1004

8:2 That the cities 5892 which Huram 2361 had restored 5414-1 to Solomon, 8010 Solomon 8010 built 1129-1 them, and caused the children 1121 of Israel 3478 to dwell 3427-55 there.

8:3 And Solomon 8010 went 3212-4 to Hamathzobah, 2574|6678|2578 and prevailed 2388-4 against it.

8:4 And he built 1129-4 Tadmor 8412 in the wilderness, 4057 and all the store 4543 cities, 5892 which he built 1129-1 in Hamath. 2574

8:5 Also he built 1129-4 Bethhoron 1032 the upper, 5945 and Bethhoron 1032 the nether, 8481 fenced 4692 cities, 5892 with walls, 2346 gates, 1817 and bars; 1280

8:6 And Baalath, 1191 and all the store 4543 cities 5892 that Solomon 8010 had, and all the chariot 7393 cities, 5892 and the cities 5892 of the horsemen, 6571 and all that 2837 Solomon 8010 desired 2836-1 to build 1129-2 in Jerusalem, 3389 and in Lebanon, 3844 and throughout all the land 776 of his dominion. 4475

8:7 [As for] all the people 5971 [that were] left 3498-12 of the Hittites, 2850 and the Amorites, 567 and the Perizzites, 6522 and the Hivites, 2340 and the Jebusites, 2983 which [were] not of Israel, 3478

8:8 [But] of their children, 1121 who were left 3498-8 after 310 them in the land, 776 whom the children 1121 of Israel 3478 consumed 3615-14 not, them did Solomon 8010 make to pay 5927-55 tribute 4522 until this day. 3117

8:9 But of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did Solomon 8010 make 5414-1 no servants 5650 for his work; 4399 but they [were] men 582 of war, 4421 and chief 8269 of his captains, 7991 and captains 8269 of his chariots 7393 and horsemen. 6571

8:10 And these [were] the chief 8269 of king 4428 Solomon's 8010 officers, 5324-12|5333-k [even] two hundred 3967 and fifty, 2572 that bare rule 7287-6 over the people. 5971

8:11 And Solomon 8010 brought up 5927-52 the daughter 1323 of Pharaoh 6547 out of the city 5892 of David 1732 unto the house 1004 that he had built 1129-1 for her: for he said, 559-1 My wife 802 shall not dwell 3427-4 in the house 1004 of David 1732 king 4428 of Israel, 3478 because [the places are] holy, 6944 whereunto the ark 727 of the LORD 3068 hath come. 935-1

8:12 Then Solomon 8010 offered 5927-52 burnt offerings 5930 unto the LORD 3068 on the altar 4196 of the LORD, 3068 which he had built 1129-1 before 6440 the porch, 197

8:13 Even after a certain rate 1697 every day, 3117 3117 offering 5927-53 according to the commandment 4687 of Moses, 4872 on the sabbaths, 7676 and on the new moons, 2320 and on the solemn feasts, 4150 three 7969 times 6471 in the year, 8141 [even] in the feast 2282 of unleavened bread, 4682 and in the feast 2282 of weeks, 7620 and in the feast 2282 of tabernacles. 5521

8:14 And he appointed, 5975-55 according to the order 4941 of David 1732 his father, 1 the courses 4256 of the priests 3548 to their service, 5656 and the Levites 3881 to their charges, 4931 to praise 1984-15 and minister 8334-15 before the priests, 3548 as the duty 1697 of every day 3117 3117 required: the porters 7778 also by their courses 4256 at every gate: 8179 8179 for so had David 1732 the man 376 of God 430 commanded. 4687

8:15 And they departed 5493-1 not from the commandment 4687 of the king 4428 unto the priests 3548 and Levites 3881 concerning any matter, 1697 or concerning the treasures. 214

8:16 Now all the work 4399 of Solomon 8010 was prepared 3559-11 unto the day 3117 of the foundation 4143 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and until it was finished. 3615-2 [So] the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 was perfected. 8003

8:17 Then went 1980-1 Solomon 8010 to Eziongeber, 6100 and to Eloth, 359 at the sea 3220 side 8193 in the land 776 of Edom. 123

8:18 And Huram 2361 sent 7971-4 him by the hands 3027 of his servants 5650 ships, 591|591-q and servants 5650 that had knowledge 3045-6 of the sea; 3220 and they went 935-4 with the servants 5650 of Solomon 8010 to Ophir, 211 and took 3947-4 thence four 702 hundred 3967 and fifty 2572 talents 3603 of gold, 2091 and brought 935-55 [them] to king 4428 Solomon. 8010

9:1 And when the queen 4436 of Sheba 7614 heard 8085-1 of the fame 8088 of Solomon, 8010 she came 935-4 to prove 5254-15 Solomon 8010 with hard questions 2420 at Jerusalem, 3389 with a very 3966 great 3515 company, 2428 and camels 1581 that bare 5375-6 spices, 1314 and gold 2091 in abundance, 7230 and precious 3368 stones: 68 and when she was come 935-4 to Solomon, 8010 she communed 1696-17 with him of all that was in her heart. 3824

9:2 And Solomon 8010 told 5046-55 her all her questions: 1697 and there was nothing 1697 hid 5956-8 from Solomon 8010 which he told 5046-52 her not.

9:3 And when the queen 4436 of Sheba 7614 had seen 7200-4 the wisdom 2451 of Solomon, 8010 and the house 1004 that he had built, 1129-1

9:4 And the meat 3978 of his table, 7979 and the sitting 4186 of his servants, 5650 and the attendance 4612 of his ministers, 8334-18 and their apparel; 4403 his cupbearers 8248-56 also, and their apparel; 4403 and his ascent 5944 by which he went up 5927-4 into the house 1004 of the LORD; 3068 there was no more spirit 7307 in her.

9:5 And she said 559-4 to the king, 4428 [It was] a true 571 report 1697 which I heard 8085-1 in mine own land 776 of thine acts, 1697 and of thy wisdom: 2451

9:6 Howbeit I believed 539-52 not their words, 1697 until I came, 935-1 and mine eyes 5869 had seen 7200-4 [it]: and, behold, the one half 2677 of the greatness 4768 of thy wisdom 2451 was not told 5046-90 me: [for] thou exceedest 3254-1 the fame 8052 that I heard. 8085-1

9:7 Happy 835 [are] thy men, 582 and happy 835 [are] these thy servants, 5650 which stand 5975-6 continually 8548 before 6440 thee, and hear 8085-6 thy wisdom. 2451

9:8 Blessed 1288-7 be the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 which delighted 2654-1 in thee to set 5414-2 thee on his throne, 3678 [to be] king 4428 for the LORD 3068 thy God: 430 because thy God 430 loved 160 Israel, 3478 to establish 5975-53 them for ever, 5769 therefore made 5414-4 he thee king 4428 over them, to do 6213-2 judgment 4941 and justice. 6666

9:9 And she gave 5414-4 the king 4428 an hundred 3967 and twenty 6242 talents 3603 of gold, 2091 and of spices 1314 great 3966 abundance, 7230 and precious 3368 stones: 68 neither was there any such spice 1314 as the queen 4436 of Sheba 7614 gave 5414-1 king 4428 Solomon. 8010

9:10 And the servants 5650 also of Huram, 2361 and the servants 5650 of Solomon, 8010 which brought 935-52 gold 2091 from Ophir, 211 brought 935-52 algum 418 trees 6086 and precious 3368 stones. 68

9:11 And the king 4428 made 6213-4 [of] the algum 418 trees 6086 terraces 4546 to the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and to the king's 4428 palace, 1004 and harps 3658 and psalteries 5035 for singers: 7891-6 and there were none such 1992 seen 7200-8 before 6440 in the land 776 of Judah. 3063

9:12 And king 4428 Solomon 8010 gave 5414-1 to the queen 4436 of Sheba 7614 all her desire, 2656 whatsoever she asked, 7592-1 beside [that] which she had brought 935-52 unto the king. 4428 So she turned, 2015-4 and went away 3212-4 to her own land, 776 she and her servants. 5650

9:13 Now the weight 4948 of gold 2091 that came 935-1 to Solomon 8010 in one 259 year 8141 was six 8337 hundred 3967 and threescore 8346 and six 8337 talents 3603 of gold; 2091

9:14 Beside [that which] chapmen 582 8446-6 and merchants 5503-6 brought. 935-56 And all the kings 4428 of Arabia 6152 and governors 6346 of the country 776 brought 935-56 gold 2091 and silver 3701 to Solomon. 8010

9:15 And king 4428 Solomon 8010 made 6213-4 two hundred 3967 targets 6793 [of] beaten 7820-7 gold: 2091 six 8337 hundred 3967 [shekels] of beaten 7820-7 gold 2091 went 5927-55 to one 259 target. 6793

9:16 And three 7969 hundred 3967 shields 4043 [made he of] beaten 7820-7 gold: 2091 three 7969 hundred 3967 [shekels] of gold 2091 went 5927-55 to one 259 shield. 4043 And the king 4428 put 5414-4 them in the house 1004 of the forest 3293 of Lebanon. 3844

9:17 Moreover the king 4428 made 6213-4 a great 1419 throne 3678 of ivory, 8127 and overlaid 6823-17 it with pure 2889 gold. 2091

9:18 And [there were] six 8337 steps 4609 to the throne, 3678 with a footstool 3534 of gold, 2091 [which were] fastened 270-94 to the throne, 3678 and stays 3027 on each side of the sitting 3427-2 place, 4725 and two 8147 lions 738 standing 5975-6 by 681 the stays: 3027

9:19 And twelve 8147 6240 lions 738 stood 5975-6 there on the one side and on the other upon the six 8337 steps. 4609 There was not the like made 6213-8 in any kingdom. 4467

9:20 And all the drinking 4945 vessels 3627 of king 4428 Solomon 8010 [were of] gold, 2091 and all the vessels 3627 of the house 1004 of the forest 3293 of Lebanon 3844 [were of] pure 5462-7 gold: 2091 none [were of] silver; 3701 it was [not] any thing 3972 accounted 2803-12 of in the days 3117 of Solomon. 8010

9:21 For the king's 4428 ships 591 went 1980-6 to Tarshish 8659 with the servants 5650 of Huram: 2361 every three 7969 years 8141 once 259 came 935-4 the ships 591 of Tarshish 8659 bringing 5375-6 gold, 2091 and silver, 3701 ivory, 8143 and apes, 6971 and peacocks. 8500

9:22 And king 4428 Solomon 8010 passed 1431-4 all the kings 4428 of the earth 776 in riches 6239 and wisdom. 2451

9:23 And all the kings 4428 of the earth 776 sought 1245-18 the presence 6440 of Solomon, 8010 to hear 8085-2 his wisdom, 2451 that God 430 had put 5414-1 in his heart. 3820

9:24 And they brought 935-56 every man 376 his present, 4503 vessels 3627 of silver, 3701 and vessels 3627 of gold, 2091 and raiment, 8008 harness, 5402 and spices, 1314 horses, 5483 and mules, 6505 a rate 1697 year 8141 by year. 8141

9:25 And Solomon 8010 had four 702 thousand 505 stalls 723 for horses 5483 and chariots, 4818 and twelve 8147 6240 thousand 505 horsemen; 6571 whom he bestowed 3240-55 in the chariot 7393 cities, 5892 and with the king 4428 at Jerusalem. 3389

9:26 And he reigned 4910-6 over all the kings 4428 from the river 5104 even unto the land 776 of the Philistines, 6430 and to the border 1366 of Egypt. 4714

9:27 And the king 4428 made 5414-4 silver 3701 in Jerusalem 3389 as stones, 68 and cedar trees 730 made 5414-1 he as the sycomore trees 8256 that [are] in the low plains 8219 in abundance. 7230

9:28 And they brought unto Solomon 8010 horses 5483 out 3318-56 of Egypt, 4714 and out of all lands. 776

9:29 Now the rest 7605 of the acts 1697 of Solomon, 8010 first 7223 and last, 314 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 1697 of Nathan 5416 the prophet, 5030 and in the prophecy 5016 of Ahijah 281 the Shilonite, 7888 and in the visions 2378 of Iddo 3260 the seer 2374 against Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat? 5028

9:30 And Solomon 8010 reigned 4427-4 in Jerusalem 3389 over all Israel 3478 forty 705 years. 8141

9:31 And Solomon 8010 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and he was buried 6912-4 in the city 5892 of David 1732 his father: 1 and Rehoboam 7346 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

10:1 And Rehoboam 7346 went 3212-4 to Shechem: 7927 for to Shechem 7927 were all Israel 3478 come 935-1 to make him king. 4427-53

10:2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 who [was] in Egypt, 4714 whither he had fled 1272-1 from the presence 6440 of Solomon 8010 the king, 4428 heard 8085-2 [it], that Jeroboam 3379 returned 7725-4 out of Egypt. 4714

10:3 And they sent 7971-4 and called 7121-4 him. So Jeroboam 3379 and all Israel 3478 came 935-4 and spake 1696-17 to Rehoboam, 7346 saying, 559-2

10:4 Thy father 1 made our yoke 5923 grievous: 7185-52 now therefore ease 7043-54 thou somewhat the grievous 7186 servitude 5656 of thy father, 1 and his heavy 3515 yoke 5923 that he put 5414-1 upon us, and we will serve 5647-4 thee.

10:5 And he said 559-4 unto them, Come again 7725-3 unto me after three 7969 days. 3117 And the people 5971 departed. 3212-4

10:6 And king 4428 Rehoboam 7346 took counsel 3289-11 with the old men 2205 that had stood 5975-6 before 6440 Solomon 8010 his father 1 while he yet lived, 2416 saying, 559-2 What 349 counsel give 3289-12 ye [me] to return 7725-53 answer 1697 to this people? 5971

10:7 And they spake 1696-17 unto him, saying, 559-2 If thou be kind 2896 to this people, 5971 and please 7521-1 them, and speak 1696-14 good 2896 words 1697 to them, they will be thy servants 5650 for ever. 3605 3117

10:8 But he forsook 5800-4 the counsel 6098 which the old men 2205 gave 3289-1 him, and took counsel 3289-11 with the young men 3206 that were brought up 1431-1 with him, that stood 5975-6 before 6440 him.

10:9 And he said 559-4 unto them, What advice give 3289-12 ye that we may return 7725-55 answer 1697 to this people, 5971 which have spoken 1696-14 to me, saying, 559-2 Ease 7043-54 somewhat the yoke 5923 that thy father 1 did put 5414-1 upon us?

10:10 And the young men 3206 that were brought up 1431-1 with him spake 1696-17 unto him, saying, 559-2 Thus shalt thou answer 559-4 the people 5971 that spake 1696-14 unto thee, saying, 559-2 Thy father 1 made our yoke 5923 heavy, 3513-52 but make thou [it] somewhat lighter 7043-54 for us; thus shalt thou say 559-4 unto them, My little 6995 [finger] shall be thicker 5666-1 than my father's 1 loins. 4975

10:11 For whereas 6258 my father 1 put 6006-52 a heavy 3515 yoke 5923 upon you, I will put more 3254-55 to your yoke: 5923 my father 1 chastised 3256-14 you with whips, 7752 but I [will chastise you] with scorpions. 6137

10:12 So Jeroboam 3379 and all the people 5971 came 935-4 to Rehoboam 7346 on the third 7992 day, 3117 as the king 4428 bade, 1696-14 saying, 559-2 Come again 7725-3 to me on the third 7992 day. 3117

10:13 And the king 4428 answered 6030-4 them roughly; 7186 and king 4428 Rehoboam 7346 forsook 5800-4 the counsel 6098 of the old men, 2205

10:14 And answered 1696-17 them after the advice 6098 of the young men, 3206 saying, 559-2 My father 1 made your yoke 5923 heavy, 3513-52 but I will add 3254-55 thereto: my father 1 chastised 3256-14 you with whips, 7752 but I [will chastise you] with scorpions. 6137

10:15 So the king 4428 hearkened 8085-1 not unto the people: 5971 for the cause 5252 was of God, 430 that the LORD 3068 might perform 6965-53 his word, 1697 which he spake 1696-14 by the hand 3027 of Ahijah 281 the Shilonite 7888 to Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat. 5028

10:16 And when all Israel 3478 [saw] 7200-1 that the king 4428 would not hearken 8085-1 unto them, the people 5971 answered 7725-55 the king, 4428 saying, 559-2 What portion 2506 have we in David? 1732 and [we have] none inheritance 5159 in the son 1121 of Jesse: 3448 every man 376 to your tents, 168 O Israel: 3478 [and] now, David, 1732 see 7200-3 to thine own house. 1004 So all Israel 3478 went 3212-4 to their tents. 168

10:17 But [as for] the children 1121 of Israel 3478 that dwelt 3427-6 in the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 Rehoboam 7346 reigned 4427-4 over them.

10:18 Then king 4428 Rehoboam 7346 sent 7971-4 Hadoram 1913 that [was] over the tribute; 4522 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 stoned 7275-4 him with stones, 68 that he died. 4191-4 But king 4428 Rehoboam 7346 made speed 553-98 to get him up 5927-2 to [his] chariot, 4818 to flee 5127-2 to Jerusalem. 3389

10:19 And Israel 3478 rebelled 6586-4 against the house 1004 of David 1732 unto this day. 3117

11:1 And when Rehoboam 7346 was come 935-4 to Jerusalem, 3389 he gathered 6950-55 of the house 1004 of Judah 3063 and Benjamin 1144 an hundred 3967 and fourscore 8084 thousand 505 chosen 977-7 [men], which were warriors, 6213-6 4421 to fight 3898-9 against Israel, 3478 that he might bring the kingdom 4467 again 7725-53 to Rehoboam. 7346

11:2 But the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came to Shemaiah 8098 the man 376 of God, 430 saying, 559-2

11:3 Speak 559-3 unto Rehoboam 7346 the son 1121 of Solomon, 8010 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and to all Israel 3478 in Judah 3063 and Benjamin, 1144 saying, 559-2

11:4 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Ye shall not go up, 5927-4 nor fight 3898-11 against your brethren: 251 return 7725-3 every man 376 to his house: 1004 for this thing 1697 is done 1961-8 of me. And they obeyed 8085-4 the words 1697 of the LORD, 3068 and returned 7725-4 from going 3212-2 against Jeroboam. 3379

11:5 And Rehoboam 7346 dwelt 3427-4 in Jerusalem, 3389 and built 1129-4 cities 5892 for defence 4692 in Judah. 3063

11:6 He built 1129-4 even Bethlehem, 1035 and Etam, 5862 and Tekoa, 8620

11:7 And Bethzur, 1049 and Shoco, 7755 and Adullam, 5725

11:8 And Gath, 1661 and Mareshah, 4762 and Ziph, 2128

11:9 And Adoraim, 115 and Lachish, 3923 and Azekah, 5825

11:10 And Zorah, 6881 and Aijalon, 357 and Hebron, 2275 which [are] in Judah 3063 and in Benjamin 1144 fenced 4694 cities. 5892

11:11 And he fortified 2388-17 the strong holds, 4694 and put 5414-4 captains 5057 in them, and store 214 of victual, 3978 and of oil 8081 and wine. 3196

11:12 And in every several city 5892 5892 [he put] shields 6793 and spears, 7420 and made them exceeding 7235-53 3966 strong, 2388-17 having Judah 3063 and Benjamin 1144 on his side.

11:13 And the priests 3548 and the Levites 3881 that [were] in all Israel 3478 resorted 3320-98 to him out of all their coasts. 1366

11:14 For the Levites 3881 left 5800-1 their suburbs 4054 and their possession, 272 and came 3212-4 to Judah 3063 and Jerusalem: 3389 for Jeroboam 3379 and his sons 1121 had cast them off 2186-52 from executing the priest's office 3547-15 unto the LORD: 3068

11:15 And he ordained 5975-55 him priests 3548 for the high places, 1116 and for the devils, 8163 and for the calves 5695 which he had made. 6213-1

11:16 And after 310 them out of all the tribes 7626 of Israel 3478 such as set 5414-6 their hearts 3824 to seek 1245-15 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 came 935-1 to Jerusalem, 3389 to sacrifice 2076-2 unto the LORD 3068 God 430 of their fathers. 1

11:17 So they strengthened 2388-17 the kingdom 4438 of Judah, 3063 and made Rehoboam 7346 the son 1121 of Solomon 8010 strong, 553-17 three 7969 years: 8141 for three 7969 years 8141 they walked 1980-1 in the way 1870 of David 1732 and Solomon. 8010

11:18 And Rehoboam 7346 took 3947-4 him Mahalath 4258 the daughter 1323|1121-k of Jerimoth 3406 the son 1121 of David 1732 to wife, 802 [and] Abihail 32 the daughter 1323 of Eliab 446 the son 1121 of Jesse; 3448

11:19 Which bare 3205-4 him children; 1121 Jeush, 3266 and Shamariah, 8114 and Zaham. 2093

11:20 And after 310 her he took 3947-1 Maachah 4601 the daughter 1323 of Absalom; 53 which bare 3205-4 him Abijah, 29 and Attai, 6262 and Ziza, 2124 and Shelomith. 8019

11:21 And Rehoboam 7346 loved 157-4 Maachah 4601 the daughter 1323 of Absalom 53 above all his wives 802 and his concubines: 6370 (for he took 5375-1 eighteen 8083 6240 wives, 802 and threescore 8346 concubines; 6370 and begat 3205-55 twenty 6242 and eight 8083 sons, 1121 and threescore 8346 daughters.) 1323

11:22 And Rehoboam 7346 made 5975-55 Abijah 29 the son 1121 of Maachah 4601 the chief, 7218 [to be] ruler 5057 among his brethren: 251 for [he thought] to make him king. 4427-53

11:23 And he dealt wisely, 995-4 and dispersed 6555-4 of all his children 1121 throughout all the countries 776 of Judah 3063 and Benjamin, 1144 unto every fenced 4694 city: 5892 and he gave 5414-4 them victual 4202 in abundance. 7230 And he desired 7592-4 many 1995 wives. 802

12:1 And it came to pass, when Rehoboam 7346 had established 3559-53 the kingdom, 4438 and had strengthened 2394 himself, he forsook 5800-1 the law 8451 of the LORD, 3068 and all Israel 3478 with him.

12:2 And it came to pass, [that] in the fifth 2549 year 8141 of king 4428 Rehoboam 7346 Shishak 7895 king 4428 of Egypt 4714 came up 5927-1 against Jerusalem, 3389 because they had transgressed 4603-1 against the LORD, 3068

12:3 With twelve hundred 3967 505 chariots, 7393 and threescore 8346 thousand 505 horsemen: 6571 and the people 5971 [were] without number 4557 that came 935-1 with him out of Egypt; 4714 the Lubims, 3864 the Sukkiims, 5525 and the Ethiopians. 3569

12:4 And he took 3920-4 the fenced 4694 cities 5892 which [pertained] to Judah, 3063 and came 935-4 to Jerusalem. 3389

12:5 Then came 935-1 Shemaiah 8098 the prophet 5030 to Rehoboam, 7346 and [to] the princes 8269 of Judah, 3063 that were gathered 622-8 together to Jerusalem 3389 because 6440 of Shishak, 7895 and said 559-4 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Ye have forsaken 5800-1 me, and therefore have I also 637 left 5800-1 you in the hand 3027 of Shishak. 7895

12:6 Whereupon the princes 8269 of Israel 3478 and the king 4428 humbled 3665-11 themselves; and they said, 559-4 The LORD 3068 [is] righteous. 6662

12:7 And when the LORD 3068 saw 7200-2 that they humbled 3665-8 themselves, the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 came to Shemaiah, 8098 saying, 559-2 They have humbled 3665-8 themselves; [therefore] I will not destroy 7843-55 them, but I will grant 5414-1 them some 4592 deliverance; 6413 and my wrath 2534 shall not be poured out 5413-4 upon Jerusalem 3389 by the hand 3027 of Shishak. 7895

12:8 Nevertheless they shall be his servants; 5650 that they may know 3045-4 my service, 5656 and the service 5656 of the kingdoms 4467 of the countries. 776

12:9 So Shishak 7895 king 4428 of Egypt 4714 came up 5927-4 against Jerusalem, 3389 and took 3947-4 away the treasures 214 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and the treasures 214 of the king's 4428 house; 1004 he took 3947-1 all: he carried away 3947-4 also the shields 4043 of gold 2091 which Solomon 8010 had made. 6213-1

12:10 Instead of which king 4428 Rehoboam 7346 made 6213-4 shields 4043 of brass, 5178 and committed 6485-52 [them] to the hands 3027 of the chief 8269 of the guard, 7323-5 that kept 8104-6 the entrance 6607 of the king's 4428 house. 1004

12:11 And when 1767 the king 4428 entered 935-2 into the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 the guard 7323-5 came 935-1 and fetched 5375-1 them, and brought them again 7725-52 into the guard 7323-5 chamber. 8372

12:12 And when he humbled 3665-9 himself, the wrath 639 of the LORD 3068 turned 7725-1 from him, that he would not destroy 7843-53 [him] altogether: 3617 and also in Judah 3063 things 1697 went well. 2896

12:13 So king 4428 Rehoboam 7346 strengthened 2388-101 himself in Jerusalem, 3389 and reigned: 4427-4 for Rehoboam 7346 [was] one 259 and forty 705 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 seventeen 7651 6240 years 8141 in Jerusalem, 3389 the city 5892 which the LORD 3068 had chosen 977-1 out of all the tribes 7626 of Israel, 3478 to put 7760-2 his name 8034 there. And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Naamah 5279 an Ammonitess. 5984

12:14 And he did 6213-4 evil, 7451 because he prepared 3559-52 not his heart 3820 to seek 1875-2 the LORD. 3068

12:15 Now the acts 1697 of Rehoboam, 7346 first 7223 and last, 314 [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 1697 of Shemaiah 8098 the prophet, 5030 and of Iddo 5714 the seer 2374 concerning genealogies? 3187-99 And [there were] wars 4421 between Rehoboam 7346 and Jeroboam 3379 continually. 3605 3117

12:16 And Rehoboam 7346 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and was buried 6912-11 in the city 5892 of David: 1732 and Abijah 29 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

13:1 Now in the eighteenth 8083 6240 year 8141 of king 4428 Jeroboam 3379 began Abijah 29 to reign 4427-4 over Judah. 3063

13:2 He reigned 4427-1 three 7969 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 His mother's 517 name 8034 also [was] Michaiah 4322 the daughter 1323 of Uriel 222 of Gibeah. 1390 And there was war 4421 between Abijah 29 and Jeroboam. 3379

13:3 And Abijah 29 set 631-4 the battle 4421 in array with an army 2428 of valiant men 1368 of war, 4421 [even] four 702 hundred 3967 thousand 505 chosen 977-7 men: 376 Jeroboam 3379 also set the battle 4421 in array 6186-1 against him with eight 8083 hundred 3967 thousand 505 chosen 977-7 men, 376 [being] mighty men 1368 of valour. 2428

13:4 And Abijah 29 stood up 6965-4 upon mount 2022 Zemaraim, 6787 which [is] in mount 2022 Ephraim, 669 and said, 559-4 Hear 8085-3 me, thou Jeroboam, 3379 and all Israel; 3478

13:5 Ought ye not to know 3045-2 that the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 gave 5414-1 the kingdom 4467 over Israel 3478 to David 1732 for ever, 5769 [even] to him and to his sons 1121 by a covenant 1285 of salt? 4417

13:6 Yet Jeroboam 3379 the son 1121 of Nebat, 5028 the servant 5650 of Solomon 8010 the son 1121 of David, 1732 is risen up, 6965-4 and hath rebelled 4775-4 against his lord. 113

13:7 And there are gathered 6908-11 unto him vain 7386 men, 582 the children 1121 of Belial, 1100 and have strengthened 553-101 themselves against Rehoboam 7346 the son 1121 of Solomon, 8010 when Rehoboam 7346 was young 5288 and tenderhearted, 7390 3824 and could not withstand 2388-98 them. 6440

13:8 And now ye think 559-6 to withstand 2388-99 the 6440 kingdom 4467 of the LORD 3068 in the hand 3027 of the sons 1121 of David; 1732 and ye [be] a great 7227 multitude, 1995 and [there are] with you golden 2091 calves, 5695 which Jeroboam 3379 made 6213-1 you for gods. 430

13:9 Have ye not cast out 5080-52 the priests 3548 of the LORD, 3068 the sons 1121 of Aaron, 175 and the Levites, 3881 and have made 6213-4 you priests 3548 after the manner of the nations 5971 of [other] lands? 776 so that whosoever cometh 935-6 to consecrate 4390-15 himself 3027 with a young 6499 1121 bullock 1241 and seven 7651 rams, 352 [the same] may be a priest 3548 of [them that are] no 3808 gods. 430

13:10 But as for us, the LORD 3068 [is] our God, 430 and we have not forsaken 5800-1 him; and the priests, 3548 which minister 8334-18 unto the LORD, 3068 [are] the sons 1121 of Aaron, 175 and the Levites 3881 [wait] upon [their] business: 4399

13:11 And they burn 6999-56 unto the LORD 3068 every morning 1242 1242 and every evening 6153 6153 burnt sacrifices 5930 and sweet 5561 incense: 7004 the shewbread 3899 4635 also [set they in order] upon the pure 2889 table; 7979 and the candlestick 4501 of gold 2091 with the lamps 5216 thereof, to burn 1197-15 every evening: 6153 6153 for we keep 8104-6 the charge 4931 of the LORD 3068 our God; 430 but ye have forsaken 5800-1 him.

13:12 And, behold, God 430 himself [is] with us for [our] captain, 7218 and his priests 3548 with sounding 8643 trumpets 2689 to cry alarm 7321-53 against you. O children 1121 of Israel, 3478 fight 3898-11 ye not against the LORD 3068 God 430 of your fathers; 1 for ye shall not prosper. 6743-55

13:13 But Jeroboam 3379 caused an ambushment 3993 to come 935-2 about 5437-52 behind 310 them: so they were before 6440 Judah, 3063 and the ambushment 3993 [was] behind 310 them.

13:14 And when Judah 3063 looked 6437-4 back, behold, the battle 4421 [was] before 6440 and behind: 268 and they cried 6817-4 unto the LORD, 3068 and the priests 3548 sounded 2690-56|2690-18-k with the trumpets. 2689

13:15 Then the men 376 of Judah 3063 gave a shout: 7321-55 and as the men 376 of Judah 3063 shouted, 7321-53 it came to pass, that God 430 smote 5062-1 Jeroboam 3379 and all Israel 3478 before 6440 Abijah 29 and Judah. 3063

13:16 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 fled 5127-4 before 6440 Judah: 3063 and God 430 delivered 5414-4 them into their hand. 3027

13:17 And Abijah 29 and his people 5971 slew 5221-55 them with a great 7227 slaughter: 4347 so there fell down 5307-4 slain 2491 of Israel 3478 five 2568 hundred 3967 thousand 505 chosen 977-7 men. 376

13:18 Thus the children 1121 of Israel 3478 were brought 3665-11 under at that time, 6256 and the children 1121 of Judah 3063 prevailed, 553-4 because they relied 8172-8 upon the LORD 3068 God 430 of their fathers. 1

13:19 And Abijah 29 pursued 7291-4 after 310 Jeroboam, 3379 and took 3920-4 cities 5892 from him, Bethel 1008 with the towns 1323 thereof, and Jeshanah 3466 with the towns 1323 thereof, and Ephrain 6085 with the towns 1323 thereof.

13:20 Neither did Jeroboam 3379 recover 6113-1 strength 3581 again in the days 3117 of Abijah: 29 and the LORD 3068 struck 5062-4 him, and he died. 4191-4

13:21 But Abijah 29 waxed mighty, 2388-101 and married 5375-4 fourteen 702 6240 wives, 802 and begat 3205-55 twenty 6242 and two 8147 sons, 1121 and sixteen 8337 6240 daughters. 1323

13:22 And the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Abijah, 29 and his ways, 1870 and his sayings, 1697 [are] written 3789-7 in the story 4097 of the prophet 5030 Iddo. 5714

14:1 So Abijah 29 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and they buried 6912-4 him in the city 5892 of David: 1732 and Asa 609 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead. In his days 3117 the land 776 was quiet 8252-1 ten 6235 years. 8141

14:2 And Asa 609 did 6213-4 [that which was] good 2896 and right 3477 in the eyes 5869 of the LORD 3068 his God: 430

14:3 For he took away 5493-55 the altars 4196 of the strange 5236 [gods], and the high places, 1116 and brake down 7665-17 the images, 4676 and cut down 1438-17 the groves: 842

14:4 And commanded 559-4 Judah 3063 to seek 1875-2 the LORD 3068 God 430 of their fathers, 1 and to do 6213-2 the law 8451 and the commandment. 4687

14:5 Also he took away 5493-55 out of all the cities 5892 of Judah 3063 the high places 1116 and the images: 2553 and the kingdom 4467 was quiet 8252-4 before 6440 him.

14:6 And he built 1129-4 fenced 4694 cities 5892 in Judah: 3063 for the land 776 had rest, 8252-1 and he had no war 4421 in those years; 8141 because the LORD 3068 had given him rest. 5117-52

14:7 Therefore he said 559-4 unto Judah, 3063 Let us build 1129-4 these cities, 5892 and make about 5437-55 [them] walls, 2346 and towers, 4026 gates, 1817 and bars, 1280 [while] the land 776 [is] yet before 6440 us; because we have sought 1875-1 the LORD 3068 our God, 430 we have sought 1875-1 [him], and he hath given us rest 5117-4 on every side. 5439 So they built 1129-4 and prospered. 6743-55

14:8 And Asa 609 had an army 2428 [of men] that bare 5375-6 targets 6793 and spears, 7420 out of Judah 3063 three 7969 hundred 3967 thousand; 505 and out of Benjamin, 1144 that bare 5375-6 shields 4043 and drew 1869-6 bows, 7198 two hundred 3967 and fourscore 8084 thousand: 505 all these [were] mighty men 1368 of valour. 2428

14:9 And there came out 3318-4 against them Zerah 2226 the Ethiopian 3569 with an host 2428 of a thousand 505 thousand, 505 and three 7969 hundred 3967 chariots; 4818 and came 935-4 unto Mareshah. 4762

14:10 Then Asa 609 went out 3318-4 against 6440 him, and they set the battle 4421 in array 6186-4 in the valley 1516 of Zephathah 6859 at Mareshah. 4762

14:11 And Asa 609 cried 7121-4 unto the LORD 3068 his God, 430 and said, 559-4 LORD, 3068 [it is] nothing with thee to help, 5826-2 whether 996 with many, 7227 or with them that have no power: 3581 help 5826-3 us, O LORD 3068 our God; 430 for we rest 8172-8 on thee, and in thy name 8034 we go 935-1 against this multitude. 1995 O LORD, 3068 thou [art] our God; 430 let not man 582 prevail 6113-4 against thee.

14:12 So the LORD 3068 smote 5062-4 the Ethiopians 3569 before 6440 Asa, 609 and before 6440 Judah; 3063 and the Ethiopians 3569 fled. 5127-4

14:13 And Asa 609 and the people 5971 that [were] with him pursued 7291-4 them unto Gerar: 1642 and the Ethiopians 3569 were overthrown, 5307-4 that they could not recover 4241 themselves; for they were destroyed 7665-8 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and before 6440 his host; 4264 and they carried away 5375-4 very 3966 much 7235-53 spoil. 7998

14:14 And they smote 5221-55 all the cities 5892 round about 5439 Gerar; 1642 for the fear 6343 of the LORD 3068 came upon them: and they spoiled 962-4 all the cities; 5892 for there was exceeding much 7227 spoil 961 in them.

14:15 They smote 5221-52 also the tents 168 of cattle, 4735 and carried away 7617-4 sheep 6629 and camels 1581 in abundance, 7230 and returned 7725-4 to Jerusalem. 3389

15:1 And the Spirit 7307 of God 430 came upon Azariah 5838 the son 1121 of Oded: 5752

15:2 And he went out 3318-4 to meet 6440 Asa, 609 and said 559-4 unto him, Hear 8085-3 ye me, Asa, 609 and all Judah 3063 and Benjamin; 1144 The LORD 3068 [is] with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek 1875-4 him, he will be found 4672-11 of you; but if ye forsake 5800-4 him, he will forsake 5800-4 you.

15:3 Now for a long 7227 season 3117 Israel 3478 [hath been] without 3808 the true 571 God, 430 and without 3808 a teaching 3384-56 priest, 3548 and without 3808 law. 8451

15:4 But when they in their trouble 6862 did turn 7725-4 unto the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 and sought 1245-17 him, he was found 4672-11 of them.

15:5 And in those times 6256 [there was] no peace 7965 to him that went out, 3318-6 nor to him that came in, 935-6 but great 7227 vexations 4103 [were] upon all the inhabitants 3427-6 of the countries. 776

15:6 And nation 1471 was destroyed 3807-27 of nation, 1471 and city 5892 of city: 5892 for God 430 did vex 2000-1 them with all adversity. 6869

15:7 Be ye strong 2388-3 therefore, and let not your hands 3027 be weak: 7503-4 for your work 6468 shall be 3426 rewarded. 7939

15:8 And when Asa 609 heard 8085-2 these words, 1697 and the prophecy 5016 of Oded 5752 the prophet, 5030 he took courage, 2388-98 and put away 5674-55 the abominable idols 8251 out of all the land 776 of Judah 3063 and Benjamin, 1144 and out of the cities 5892 which he had taken 3920-1 from mount 2022 Ephraim, 669 and renewed 2318-17 the altar 4196 of the LORD, 3068 that [was] before 6440 the porch 197 of the LORD. 3068

15:9 And he gathered 6908-4 all Judah 3063 and Benjamin, 1144 and the strangers 1481-6 with them out of Ephraim 669 and Manasseh, 4519 and out of Simeon: 8095 for they fell 5307-1 to him out of Israel 3478 in abundance, 7230 when they saw 7200-2 that the LORD 3068 his God 430 [was] with him.

15:10 So they gathered themselves together 6908-11 at Jerusalem 3389 in the third 7992 month, 2320 in the fifteenth 2568 6240 year 8141 of the reign 4438 of Asa. 609

15:11 And they offered 2076-4 unto the LORD 3068 the same time, 3117 of the spoil 7998 [which] they had brought, 935-52 seven 7651 hundred 3967 oxen 1241 and seven 7651 thousand 505 sheep. 6629

15:12 And they entered 935-4 into a covenant 1285 to seek 1875-2 the LORD 3068 God 430 of their fathers 1 with all their heart 3824 and with all their soul; 5315

15:13 That whosoever would not seek 1875-4 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 should be put to death, 4191-93 whether 4480 small 6996 or great, 1419 whether man 376 or woman. 802

15:14 And they sware 7650-11 unto the LORD 3068 with a loud 1419 voice, 6963 and with shouting, 8643 and with trumpets, 2689 and with cornets. 7782

15:15 And all Judah 3063 rejoiced 8055-4 at the oath: 7621 for they had sworn 7650-8 with all their heart, 3824 and sought 1245-14 him with their whole desire; 7522 and he was found 4672-11 of them: and the LORD 3068 gave them rest 5117-4 round about. 5439

15:16 And also [concerning] Maachah 4601 the mother 517 of Asa 609 the king, 4428 he removed 5493-52 her from [being] queen, 1377 because she had made 6213-1 an idol 4656 in a grove: 842 and Asa 609 cut down 3772-4 her idol, 4656 and stamped 1854-55 [it], and burnt 8313-4 [it] at the brook 5158 Kidron. 6939

15:17 But the high places 1116 were not taken away 5493-1 out of Israel: 3478 nevertheless the heart 3824 of Asa 609 was perfect 8003 all his days. 3117

15:18 And he brought into 935-55 the house 1004 of God 430 the things that his father 1 had dedicated, 6944 and that he himself had dedicated, 6944 silver, 3701 and gold, 2091 and vessels. 3627

15:19 And there was no [more] war 4421 unto the five 2568 and thirtieth 7970 year 8141 of the reign 4438 of Asa. 609

16:1 In the six 8337 and thirtieth 7970 year 8141 of the reign 4438 of Asa 609 Baasha 1201 king 4428 of Israel 3478 came up 5927-1 against Judah, 3063 and built 1129-4 Ramah, 7414 to the intent that he might let 5414-2 none 1115 go out 3318-6 or come in 935-6 to Asa 609 king 4428 of Judah. 3063

16:2 Then Asa 609 brought out 3318-55 silver 3701 and gold 2091 out of the treasures 214 of the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 and of the king's 4428 house, 1004 and sent 7971-4 to Benhadad 1130 king 4428 of Syria, 758 that dwelt 3427-6 at Damascus, 1834 saying, 559-2

16:3 [There is] a league 1285 between me and thee, as [there was] between my father 1 and thy father: 1 behold, I have sent 7971-1 thee silver 3701 and gold; 2091 go, 3212-3 break 6565-54 thy league 1285 with Baasha 1201 king 4428 of Israel, 3478 that he may depart 5927-4 from me.

16:4 And Benhadad 1130 hearkened 8085-4 unto king 4428 Asa, 609 and sent 7971-4 the captains 8269 of his armies 2428 against the cities 5892 of Israel; 3478 and they smote 5221-55 Ijon, 5859 and Dan, 1835 and Abelmaim, 66 and all the store 4543 cities 5892 of Naphtali. 5321

16:5 And it came to pass, when Baasha 1201 heard 8085-2 [it], that he left off 2308-4 building 1129-2 of Ramah, 7414 and let his work 4399 cease. 7673-55

16:6 Then Asa 609 the king 4428 took 3947-1 all Judah; 3063 and they carried away 5375-4 the stones 68 of Ramah, 7414 and the timber 6086 thereof, wherewith Baasha 1201 was building; 1129-1 and he built 1129-4 therewith Geba 1387 and Mizpah. 4709

16:7 And at that time 6256 Hanani 2607 the seer 7200-6 came 935-1 to Asa 609 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and said 559-4 unto him, Because thou hast relied 8172-9 on the king 4428 of Syria, 758 and not relied 8172-8 on the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 therefore is the host 2428 of the king 4428 of Syria 758 escaped 4422-8 out of thine hand. 3027

16:8 Were not the Ethiopians 3569 and the Lubims 3864 a huge 7230 host, 2428 with very 3966 many 7235-53 chariots 7393 and horsemen? 6571 yet, because thou didst rely 8172-9 on the LORD, 3068 he delivered 5414-1 them into thine hand. 3027

16:9 For the eyes 5869 of the LORD 3068 run to and fro 7751-35 throughout the whole earth, 776 to shew himself strong 2388-99 in the behalf of [them] whose heart 3824 [is] perfect 8003 toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: 5528-8 therefore from henceforth 6258 thou shalt have 3426 wars. 4421

16:10 Then Asa 609 was wroth 3707-4 with the seer, 7200-6 and put 5414-4 him in a prison 4115 house; 1004 for [he was] in a rage 2197 with him because of this [thing]. And Asa 609 oppressed 7533-17 [some] of the people 5971 the same time. 6256

16:11 And, behold, the acts 1697 of Asa, 609 first 7223 and last, 314 lo, they [are] written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the kings 4428 of Judah 3063 and Israel. 3478

16:12 And Asa 609 in the thirty 7970 and ninth 8672 year 8141 of his reign 4438 was diseased 2456-4 in his feet, 7272 until his disease 2483 [was] exceeding 4605 [great]: yet in his disease 2483 he sought 1875-1 not to the LORD, 3068 but to the physicians. 7495-6

16:13 And Asa 609 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and died 4191-4 in the one 259 and fortieth 705 year 8141 of his reign. 4427-2

16:14 And they buried 6912-4 him in his own sepulchres, 6913 which he had made 3738-1 for himself in the city 5892 of David, 1732 and laid 7901-55 him in the bed 4904 which was filled 4390-14 with sweet odours 1314 and divers kinds 2177 [of spices] prepared 7543-30 by the apothecaries' 4842 art: 4639 and they made 8313-4 a very 3966 great 1419 burning 8316 for him.

17:1 And Jehoshaphat 3092 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead, and strengthened 2388-101 himself against Israel. 3478

17:2 And he placed 5414-4 forces 2428 in all the fenced 1219-7 cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 and set 5414-4 garrisons 5333 in the land 776 of Judah, 3063 and in the cities 5892 of Ephraim, 669 which Asa 609 his father 1 had taken. 3920-1

17:3 And the LORD 3068 was with Jehoshaphat, 3092 because he walked 1980-1 in the first 7223 ways 1870 of his father 1 David, 1732 and sought 1875-1 not unto Baalim; 1168

17:4 But sought 1875-1 to the [LORD] God 430 of his father, 1 and walked 1980-1 in his commandments, 4687 and not after the doings 4639 of Israel. 3478

17:5 Therefore the LORD 3068 stablished 3559-55 the kingdom 4467 in his hand; 3027 and all Judah 3063 brought 5414-4 to Jehoshaphat 3092 presents; 4503 and he had riches 6239 and honour 3519 in abundance. 7230

17:6 And his heart 3820 was lifted up 1361-4 in the ways 1870 of the LORD: 3068 moreover he took away 5493-52 the high places 1116 and groves 842 out of Judah. 3063

17:7 Also in the third 7969 year 8141 of his reign 4427-2 he sent 7971-1 to his princes, 8269 [even] to Benhail, 1134 and to Obadiah, 5662 and to Zechariah, 2148 and to Nethaneel, 5417 and to Michaiah, 4322 to teach 3925-15 in the cities 5892 of Judah. 3063

17:8 And with them [he sent] Levites, 3881 [even] Shemaiah, 8098 and Nethaniah, 5418 and Zebadiah, 2069 and Asahel, 6214 and Shemiramoth, 8070 and Jehonathan, 3083 and Adonijah, 138 and Tobijah, 2900 and Tobadonijah, 2899 Levites; 3881 and with them Elishama 476 and Jehoram, 3088 priests. 3548

17:9 And they taught 3925-17 in Judah, 3063 and [had] the book 5612 of the law 8451 of the LORD 3068 with them, and went about 5437-4 throughout all the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 and taught 3925-17 the people. 5971

17:10 And the fear 6343 of the LORD 3068 fell upon all the kingdoms 4467 of the lands 776 that [were] round about 5439 Judah, 3063 so that they made no war 3898-8 against Jehoshaphat. 3092

17:11 Also [some] of the Philistines 6430 brought 935-56 Jehoshaphat 3092 presents, 4503 and tribute 4853 silver; 3701 and the Arabians 6163 brought 935-56 him flocks, 6629 seven 7651 thousand 505 and seven 7651 hundred 3967 rams, 352 and seven 7651 thousand 505 and seven 7651 hundred 3967 he goats. 8495

17:12 And Jehoshaphat 3092 waxed 1980-6 great 1432 exceedingly; 4605 and he built 1129-4 in Judah 3063 castles, 1003 and cities 5892 of store. 4543

17:13 And he had much 7227 business 4399 in the cities 5892 of Judah: 3063 and the men 582 of war, 4421 mighty men 1368 of valour, 2428 [were] in Jerusalem. 3389

17:14 And these [are] the numbers 6486 of them according to the house 1004 of their fathers: 1 Of Judah, 3063 the captains 8269 of thousands; 505 Adnah 5734 the chief, 8269 and with him mighty men 1368 of valour 2428 three 7969 hundred 3967 thousand. 505

17:15 And next to him 3027 [was] Jehohanan 3076 the captain, 8269 and with him two hundred 3967 and fourscore 8084 thousand. 505

17:16 And next him 3027 [was] Amasiah 6007 the son 1121 of Zichri, 2147 who willingly offered 5068-102 himself unto the LORD; 3068 and with him two hundred 3967 thousand 505 mighty men 1368 of valour. 2428

17:17 And of Benjamin; 1144 Eliada 450 a mighty man 1368 of valour, 2428 and with him armed 5401-6 men with bow 7198 and shield 4043 two hundred 3967 thousand. 505

17:18 And next him 3027 [was] Jehozabad, 3075 and with him an hundred 3967 and fourscore 8084 thousand 505 ready prepared 2502-7 for the war. 6635

17:19 These waited on 8334-18 the king, 4428 beside [those] whom the king 4428 put 5414-1 in the fenced 4013 cities 5892 throughout all Judah. 3063

18:1 Now Jehoshaphat 3092 had riches 6239 and honour 3519 in abundance, 7230 and joined affinity 2859-101 with Ahab. 256

18:2 And after 7093 [certain] years 8141 he went down 3381-4 to Ahab 256 to Samaria. 8111 And Ahab 256 killed 2076-4 sheep 6629 and oxen 1241 for him in abundance, 7230 and for the people 5971 that [he had] with him, and persuaded 5496-55 him to go up 5927-2 [with him] to Ramothgilead. 7433 1568

18:3 And Ahab 256 king 4428 of Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto Jehoshaphat 3092 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 Wilt thou go 3212-4 with me to Ramothgilead? 7433 1568 And he answered 559-4 him, I [am] as thou [art], and my people 5971 as thy people; 5971 and [we will be] with thee in the war. 4421

18:4 And Jehoshaphat 3092 said 559-4 unto the king 4428 of Israel, 3478 Enquire, 1875-3 I pray thee, at the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 to day. 3117

18:5 Therefore the king 4428 of Israel 3478 gathered together 6908-4 of prophets 5030 four 702 hundred 3967 men, 376 and said 559-4 unto them, Shall we go 3212-4 to Ramothgilead 7433 1568 to battle, 4421 or shall I forbear? 2308-4 And they said, 559-4 Go up; 5927-3 for God 430 will deliver 5414-4 [it] into the king's 4428 hand. 3027

18:6 But Jehoshaphat 3092 said, 559-4 [Is there] not here a prophet 5030 of the LORD 3068 besides, that we might enquire 1875-4 of him?

18:7 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto Jehoshaphat, 3092 [There is] yet one 259 man, 376 by whom we may enquire 1875-2 of the LORD: 3068 but I hate 8130-1 him; for he never prophesied 5012-102 good 2896 unto me, but always 3605 3117 evil: 7451 the same [is] Micaiah 4321 the son 1121 of Imla. 3229 And Jehoshaphat 3092 said, 559-4 Let not the king 4428 say 559-4 so.

18:8 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 called 7121-4 for one 259 [of his] officers, 5631 and said, 559-4 Fetch quickly 4116-16 Micaiah 4319 the son 1121 of Imla. 3229

18:9 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 and Jehoshaphat 3092 king 4428 of Judah 3063 sat 3427-6 either of them 376 on his throne, 3678 clothed 3847-30 in [their] robes, 899 and they sat 3427-6 in a void place 1637 at the entering in 6607 of the gate 8179 of Samaria; 8111 and all the prophets 5030 prophesied 5012-102 before 6440 them.

18:10 And Zedekiah 6667 the son 1121 of Chenaanah 3668 had made 6213-4 him horns 7161 of iron, 1270 and said, 559-4 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 With these thou shalt push 5055-17 Syria 758 until they be consumed. 3615-15

18:11 And all the prophets 5030 prophesied 5012-12 so, saying, 559-2 Go up 5927-3 to Ramothgilead, 7433 1568 and prosper: 6743-54 for the LORD 3068 shall deliver 5414-1 [it] into the hand 3027 of the king. 4428

18:12 And the messenger 4397 that went 1980-1 to call 7121-2 Micaiah 4321 spake 1696-14 to him, saying, 559-2 Behold, the words 1697 of the prophets 5030 [declare] good 2896 to the king 4428 with one 259 assent; 6310 let thy word 1697 therefore, I pray thee, be like one 259 of theirs, and speak 1696-14 thou good. 2896

18:13 And Micaiah 4321 said, 559-4 [As] the LORD 3068 liveth, 2416 even what my God 430 saith, 559-4 that will I speak. 1696-17

18:14 And when he was come 935-4 to the king, 4428 the king 4428 said 559-4 unto him, Micaiah, 4318 shall we go 3212-4 to Ramothgilead 7433 1568 to battle, 4421 or shall I forbear? 2308-4 And he said, 559-4 Go ye up, 5927-3 and prosper, 6743-54 and they shall be delivered 5414-11 into your hand. 3027

18:15 And the king 4428 said 559-4 to him, How many times 6471 shall I adjure 7650-56 thee that thou say 1696-17 nothing but the truth 571 to me in the name 8034 of the LORD? 3068

18:16 Then he said, 559-4 I did see 7200-1 all Israel 3478 scattered 6327-12 upon the mountains, 2022 as sheep 6629 that have no shepherd: 7462-6 and the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 These have no master; 113 let them return 7725-4 [therefore] every man 376 to his house 1004 in peace. 7965

18:17 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 said 559-4 to Jehoshaphat, 3092 Did I not tell 559-1 thee [that] he would not prophesy 5012-101 good 2896 unto me, but evil? 7451

18:18 Again he said, 559-4 Therefore hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD; 3068 I saw 7200-1 the LORD 3068 sitting 3427-6 upon his throne, 3678 and all the host 6635 of heaven 8064 standing 5975-6 on his right hand 3225 and [on] his left. 8040

18:19 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 Who shall entice 6601-17 Ahab 256 king 4428 of Israel, 3478 that he may go up 5927-4 and fall 5307-4 at Ramothgilead? 7433 1568 And one spake 559-4 saying 559-6 after this manner, 3602 and another saying 559-6 after that manner. 3602

18:20 Then there came out 3318-4 a spirit, 7307 and stood 5975-4 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and said, 559-4 I will entice 6601-17 him. And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, Wherewith?

18:21 And he said, 559-4 I will go out, 3318-4 and be a lying 8267 spirit 7307 in the mouth 6310 of all his prophets. 5030 And [the LORD] said, 559-4 Thou shalt entice 6601-17 [him], and thou shalt also prevail: 3201-4 go out, 3318-3 and do 6213-3 [even] so.

18:22 Now therefore, behold, the LORD 3068 hath put 5414-1 a lying 8267 spirit 7307 in the mouth 6310 of these thy prophets, 5030 and the LORD 3068 hath spoken 1696-14 evil 7451 against thee.

18:23 Then Zedekiah 6667 the son 1121 of Chenaanah 3668 came near, 5066-4 and smote 5221-55 Micaiah 4321 upon the cheek, 3895 and said, 559-4 Which 335 way 1870 went 5674-1 the Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 from me to speak 1696-15 unto thee?

18:24 And Micaiah 4321 said, 559-4 Behold, thou shalt see 7200-6 on that day 3117 when thou shalt go 935-4 into an inner 2315 chamber 2315 to hide 2244-9 thyself.

18:25 Then the king 4428 of Israel 3478 said, 559-4 Take 3947-3 ye Micaiah, 4321 and carry him back 7725-54 to Amon 526 the governor 8269 of the city, 5892 and to Joash 3101 the king's 4428 son; 1121

18:26 And say, 559-1 Thus saith 559-1 the king, 4428 Put 7760-3 this [fellow] in the prison, 1004 3608 and feed 398-54 him with bread 3899 of affliction 3906 and with water 4325 of affliction, 3906 until I return 7725-2 in peace. 7965

18:27 And Micaiah 4321 said, 559-4 If thou certainly 7725-2 return 7725-4 in peace, 7965 [then] hath not the LORD 3068 spoken 1696-14 by me. And he said, 559-4 Hearken, 8085-3 all ye people. 5971

18:28 So the king 4428 of Israel 3478 and Jehoshaphat 3092 the king 4428 of Judah 3063 went up 5927-4 to Ramothgilead. 7433 1568

18:29 And the king 4428 of Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto Jehoshaphat, 3092 I will disguise 2664-99 myself, and will go 935-2 to the battle; 4421 but put thou on 3847-3 thy robes. 899 So the king 4428 of Israel 3478 disguised 2664-101 himself; and they went 935-4 to the battle. 4421

18:30 Now the king 4428 of Syria 758 had commanded 6680-14 the captains 8269 of the chariots 7393 that [were] with him, saying, 559-2 Fight 3898-11 ye not with small 6996 or great, 1419 save only with the king 4428 of Israel. 3478

18:31 And it came to pass, when the captains 8269 of the chariots 7393 saw 7200-2 Jehoshaphat, 3092 that they said, 559-1 It [is] the king 4428 of Israel. 3478 Therefore they compassed 5437-4 about him to fight: 3898-9 but Jehoshaphat 3092 cried out, 2199-4 and the LORD 3068 helped 5826-1 him; and God 430 moved 5496-55 them [to depart] from him.

18:32 For it came to pass, that, when the captains 8269 of the chariots 7393 perceived 7200-2 that it was not the king 4428 of Israel, 3478 they turned back again 7725-4 from pursuing 310 him.

18:33 And a [certain] man 376 drew 4900-1 a bow 7198 at a venture, 8537 and smote 5221-55 the king 4428 of Israel 3478 between the joints 1694 of the harness: 8302 therefore he said 559-4 to his chariot man, 7395 Turn 2015-3 thine hand, 3027 that thou mayest carry me out 3318-52 of the host; 4264 for I am wounded. 2470-90

18:34 And the battle 4421 increased 5927-4 that day: 3117 howbeit the king 4428 of Israel 3478 stayed 5975-56 [himself] up in [his] chariot 4818 against 5227 the Syrians 758 until the even: 6153 and about the time 6256 of the sun 8121 going down 935-2 he died. 4191-4

19:1 And Jehoshaphat 3092 the king 4428 of Judah 3063 returned 7725-4 to his house 1004 in peace 7965 to Jerusalem. 3389

19:2 And Jehu 3058 the son 1121 of Hanani 2607 the seer 2374 went out 3318-4 to meet 6440 him, and said 559-4 to king 4428 Jehoshaphat, 3092 Shouldest thou help 5826-2 the ungodly, 7563 and love 157-4 them that hate 8130-6 the LORD? 3068 therefore 2063 [is] wrath 7110 upon thee from before 6440 the LORD. 3068

19:3 Nevertheless 61 there are good 2896 things 1697 found 4672-8 in thee, in that thou hast taken away 1197-14 the groves 842 out of the land, 776 and hast prepared 3559-52 thine heart 3824 to seek 1875-2 God. 430

19:4 And Jehoshaphat 3092 dwelt 3427-4 at Jerusalem: 3389 and he went out 3318-4 again 7725-4 through the people 5971 from Beersheba 884 to mount 2022 Ephraim, 669 and brought them back 7725-55 unto the LORD 3068 God 430 of their fathers. 1

19:5 And he set 5975-55 judges 8199-6 in the land 776 throughout all the fenced 1219-7 cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 city 5892 by city, 5892

19:6 And said 559-4 to the judges, 8199-6 Take heed 7200-3 what ye do: 6213-6 for ye judge 8199-4 not for man, 120 but for the LORD, 3068 who [is] with you in the judgment. 1697 4941

19:7 Wherefore now let the fear 6343 of the LORD 3068 be upon you; take heed 8104-3 and do 6213-3 [it]: for [there is] no iniquity 5766 with the LORD 3068 our God, 430 nor respect 4856 of persons, 6440 nor taking 4727 of gifts. 7810

19:8 Moreover in Jerusalem 3389 did Jehoshaphat 3092 set 5975-52 of the Levites, 3881 and [of] the priests, 3548 and of the chief 7218 of the fathers 1 of Israel, 3478 for the judgment 4941 of the LORD, 3068 and for controversies, 7379 when they returned 7725-4 to Jerusalem. 3389

19:9 And he charged 6680-17 them, saying, 559-2 Thus shall ye do 6213-4 in the fear 3374 of the LORD, 3068 faithfully, 530 and with a perfect 8003 heart. 3824

19:10 And what cause 7379 soever shall come 935-4 to you of your brethren 251 that dwell 3427-6 in their cities, 5892 between blood 1818 and blood, 1818 between law 8451 and commandment, 4687 statutes 2706 and judgments, 4941 ye shall even warn 2094-52 them that they trespass 816-4 not against the LORD, 3068 and [so] wrath 7110 come upon you, and upon your brethren: 251 this 3541 do, 6213-4 and ye shall not trespass. 816-4

19:11 And, behold, Amariah 568 the chief 7218 priest 3548 [is] over you in all matters 1697 of the LORD; 3068 and Zebadiah 2069 the son 1121 of Ishmael, 3458 the ruler 5057 of the house 1004 of Judah, 3063 for all the king's 4428 matters: 1697 also the Levites 3881 [shall be] officers 7860-6 before 6440 you. Deal 6213-3 courageously, 2388-3 and the LORD 3068 shall be with the good. 2896

20:1 It came to pass after 310 this also, [that] the children 1121 of Moab, 4124 and the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 and with them [other] beside the Ammonites, 5984 came 935-1 against Jehoshaphat 3092 to battle. 4421

20:2 Then there came 935-4 some that told 5046-55 Jehoshaphat, 3092 saying, 559-2 There cometh 935-6 a great 7227 multitude 1995 against thee from beyond 5676 the sea 3220 on this side Syria; 758 and, behold, they [be] in Hazazontamar, 2688 which [is] Engedi. 5872

20:3 And Jehoshaphat 3092 feared, 3372-4 and set 5414-4 himself 6440 to seek 1875-2 the LORD, 3068 and proclaimed 7121-4 a fast 6685 throughout 5921 all Judah. 3063

20:4 And Judah 3063 gathered themselves together, 6908-11 to ask 1245-15 [help] of the LORD: 3068 even out of all the cities 5892 of Judah 3063 they came 935-1 to seek 1245-15 the LORD. 3068

20:5 And Jehoshaphat 3092 stood 5975-4 in the congregation 6951 of Judah 3063 and Jerusalem, 3389 in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 before 6440 the new 2319 court, 2691

20:6 And said, 559-4 O LORD 3068 God 430 of our fathers, 1 [art] not thou God 430 in heaven? 8064 and rulest 4910-6 [not] thou over all the kingdoms 4467 of the heathen? 1471 and in thine hand 3027 [is there not] power 3581 and might, 1369 so that none is able to withstand 3320-99 thee?

20:7 [Art] not thou our God, 430 [who] didst drive out 3423-52 the inhabitants 3427-6 of this land 776 before 6440 thy people 5971 Israel, 3478 and gavest 5414-4 it to the seed 2233 of Abraham 85 thy friend 157-6 for ever? 5769

20:8 And they dwelt 3427-4 therein, and have built 1129-4 thee a sanctuary 4720 therein for thy name, 8034 saying, 559-2

20:9 If, [when] evil 7451 cometh 935-4 upon us, [as] the sword, 2719 judgment, 8196 or pestilence, 1698 or famine, 7458 we stand 5975-4 before 6440 this house, 1004 and in thy presence, 6440 (for thy name 8034 [is] in this house,) 1004 and cry 2199-4 unto thee in our affliction, 6869 then thou wilt hear 8085-4 and help. 3467-55

20:10 And now, behold, the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 and Moab 4124 and mount 2022 Seir, 8165 whom thou wouldest not let 5414-1 Israel 3478 invade, 935-2 when they came 935-2 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 but they turned 5493-1 from them, and destroyed 8045-52 them not;

20:11 Behold, [I say, how] they reward 1580-6 us, to come 935-2 to cast us out 1644-15 of thy possession, 3425 which thou hast given us to inherit. 3423-52

20:12 O our God, 430 wilt thou not judge 8199-4 them? for we have no might 3581 against 6440 this great 7227 company 1995 that cometh 935-6 against us; neither know 3045-4 we 587 what to do: 6213-4 but our eyes 5869 [are] upon thee.

20:13 And all Judah 3063 stood 5975-6 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 with 1571 their little ones, 2945 their wives, 802 and their children. 1121

20:14 Then upon Jahaziel 3166 the son 1121 of Zechariah, 2148 the son 1121 of Benaiah, 1141 the son 1121 of Jeiel, 3273 the son 1121 of Mattaniah, 4983 a Levite 3881 of the sons 1121 of Asaph, 623 came the Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 in the midst 8432 of the congregation; 6951

20:15 And he said, 559-4 Hearken 7181-54 ye, all Judah, 3063 and ye inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem, 3389 and thou king 4428 Jehoshaphat, 3092 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 unto you, Be not afraid 3372-4 nor dismayed 2865-11 by reason 6440 of this great 7227 multitude; 1995 for the battle 4421 [is] not yours, but God's. 430

20:16 To morrow 4279 go ye down 3381-3 against them: behold, they come up 5927-6 by the cliff 4608 of Ziz; 6732 and ye shall find 4672-1 them at the end 5490 of the brook, 5158 before 6440 the wilderness 4057 of Jeruel. 3385

20:17 Ye shall not [need] to fight 3898-9 in this 2063 [battle]: set 3320-100 yourselves, stand 5975-3 ye [still], and see 7200-3 the salvation 3444 of the LORD 3068 with you, O Judah 3063 and Jerusalem: 3389 fear 3372-4 not, nor be dismayed; 2865-11 to morrow 4279 go out 3318-3 against 6440 them: for the LORD 3068 [will be] with you.

20:18 And Jehoshaphat 3092 bowed his head 6915-4 with [his] face 639 to the ground: 776 and all Judah 3063 and the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem 3389 fell 5307-1 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 worshipping 7812-99 the LORD. 3068

20:19 And the Levites, 3881 of the children 1121 of the Kohathites, 6956 and of the children 1121 of the Korhites, 7145 stood up 6965-4 to praise 1984-15 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 with a loud 1419 voice 6963 on high. 4605

20:20 And they rose early 7925-55 in the morning, 1242 and went forth 3318-4 into the wilderness 4057 of Tekoa: 8620 and as they went forth, 3318-2 Jehoshaphat 3092 stood 5975-1 and said, 559-4 Hear 8085-3 me, O Judah, 3063 and ye inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem; 3389 Believe 539-54 in the LORD 3068 your God, 430 so shall ye be established; 539-11 believe 539-54 his prophets, 5030 so shall ye prosper. 6743-54

20:21 And when he had consulted 3289-11 with the people, 5971 he appointed 5975-55 singers 7891-35 unto the LORD, 3068 and that should praise 1984-18 the beauty 1927 of holiness, 6944 as they went out 3318-2 before 6440 the army, 2502-7 and to say, 559-6 Praise 3034-54 the LORD; 3068 for his mercy 2617 [endureth] for ever. 5769

20:22 And when 6256 they began 2490-52 to sing 7440 and to praise, 8416 the LORD 3068 set 5414-1 ambushments 693-18 against the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 Moab, 4124 and mount 2022 Seir, 8165 which were come 935-6 against Judah; 3063 and they were smitten. 5062-11

20:23 For the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 and Moab 4124 stood up 5975-4 against the inhabitants 3427-6 of mount 2022 Seir, 8165 utterly to slay 2763-53 and destroy 8045-53 [them]: and when they had made an end 3615-15 of the inhabitants 3427-6 of Seir, 8165 every one 376 helped 5826-1 to destroy 4889 another. 7453

20:24 And when Judah 3063 came 935-1 toward the watch tower 4707|4708 in the wilderness, 4057 they looked 6437-4 unto the multitude, 1995 and, behold, they [were] dead bodies 6297 fallen 5307-6 to the earth, 776 and none escaped. 6413

20:25 And when Jehoshaphat 3092 and his people 5971 came 935-4 to take away 962-2 the spoil 7998 of them, they found 4672-4 among them in abundance 7230 both riches 7399 with the dead bodies, 6297 and precious 2532 jewels, 3627 which they stripped off 5337-17 for themselves, more than 369 they could carry away: 4853 and they were three 7969 days 3117 in gathering 962-6 of the spoil, 7998 it was so much. 7227

20:26 And on the fourth 7243 day 3117 they assembled 6950-8 themselves in the valley 6010 of Berachah; 1293|1294 for there they blessed 1288-14 the LORD: 3068 therefore the name 8034 of the same place 4725 was called, 7121-1 The valley 6010 of Berachah, 1293|1294 unto this day. 3117

20:27 Then they returned, 7725-4 every man 376 of Judah 3063 and Jerusalem, 3389 and Jehoshaphat 3092 in the forefront 7218 of them, to go again 7725-2 to Jerusalem 3389 with joy; 8057 for the LORD 3068 had made them to rejoice 8055-14 over their enemies. 341-6

20:28 And they came 935-4 to Jerusalem 3389 with psalteries 5035 and harps 3658 and trumpets 2689 unto the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

20:29 And the fear 6343 of God 430 was on all the kingdoms 4467 of [those] countries, 776 when they had heard 8085-2 that the LORD 3068 fought 3898-8 against the enemies 341-6 of Israel. 3478

20:30 So the realm 4438 of Jehoshaphat 3092 was quiet: 8252-4 for his God 430 gave him rest 5117-4 round about. 5439

20:31 And Jehoshaphat 3092 reigned 4427-4 over Judah: 3063 [he was] thirty 7970 and five 2568 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 twenty 6242 and five 2568 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Azubah 5806 the daughter 1323 of Shilhi. 7977

20:32 And he walked 3212-4 in the way 1870 of Asa 609 his father, 1 and departed 5493-1 not from it, doing 6213-2 [that which was] right 3477 in the sight 5869 of the LORD. 3068

20:33 Howbeit the high places 1116 were not taken away: 5493-1 for as yet the people 5971 had not prepared 3559-52 their hearts 3824 unto the God 430 of their fathers. 1

20:34 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Jehoshaphat, 3092 first 7223 and last, 314 behold, they [are] written 3789-7 in the book 1697 of Jehu 3058 the son 1121 of Hanani, 2607 who [is] mentioned 5927-90 in the book 5612 of the kings 4428 of Israel. 3478

20:35 And after 310 this did Jehoshaphat 3092 king 4428 of Judah 3063 join 2266-98 himself with Ahaziah 274 king 4428 of Israel, 3478 who did 6213-2 very wickedly: 7561-52

20:36 And he joined 2266-17 himself with him to make 6213-2 ships 591 to go 3212-2 to Tarshish: 8659 and they made 6213-4 the ships 591 in Eziongeber. 6100

20:37 Then Eliezer 461 the son 1121 of Dodavah 1735 of Mareshah 4762 prophesied 5012-101 against Jehoshaphat, 3092 saying, 559-2 Because thou hast joined 2266-99 thyself with Ahaziah, 274 the LORD 3068 hath broken 6555-1 thy works. 4639 And the ships 591 were broken, 7665-11 that they were not able 6113-1 to go 3212-2 to Tarshish. 8659

21:1 Now Jehoshaphat 3092 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and was buried 6912-11 with his fathers 1 in the city 5892 of David. 1732 And Jehoram 3088 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

21:2 And he had brethren 251 the sons 1121 of Jehoshaphat, 3092 Azariah, 5838 and Jehiel, 3171 and Zechariah, 2148 and Azariah, 5838 and Michael, 4317 and Shephatiah: 8203 all these [were] the sons 1121 of Jehoshaphat 3092 king 4428 of Israel. 3478

21:3 And their father 1 gave 5414-4 them great 7227 gifts 4979 of silver, 3701 and of gold, 2091 and of precious things, 4030 with fenced 4694 cities 5892 in Judah: 3063 but the kingdom 4467 gave 5414-1 he to Jehoram; 3088 because he [was] the firstborn. 1060

21:4 Now when Jehoram 3088 was risen up 6965-4 to the kingdom 4467 of his father, 1 he strengthened 2388-101 himself, and slew 2026-4 all his brethren 251 with the sword, 2719 and [divers] also of the princes 8269 of Israel. 3478

21:5 Jehoram 3088 [was] thirty 7970 and two 8147 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 eight 8083 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389

21:6 And he walked 3212-4 in the way 1870 of the kings 4428 of Israel, 3478 like as did 6213-1 the house 1004 of Ahab: 256 for he had the daughter 1323 of Ahab 256 to wife: 802 and he wrought 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the eyes 5869 of the LORD. 3068

21:7 Howbeit the LORD 3068 would 14-1 not destroy 7843-53 the house 1004 of David, 1732 because of the covenant 1285 that he had made 3772-1 with David, 1732 and as he promised 559-1 to give 5414-2 a light 5216 to him and to his sons 1121 for ever. 3605 3117

21:8 In his days 3117 the Edomites 123 revolted 6586-1 from under the dominion 3027 of Judah, 3063 and made 4427-55 themselves a king. 4428

21:9 Then Jehoram 3088 went forth 5674-4 with his princes, 8269 and all his chariots 7393 with him: and he rose up 6965-1 by night, 3915 and smote 5221-55 the Edomites 123 which compassed 5437-6 him in, and the captains 8269 of the chariots. 7393

21:10 So the Edomites 123 revolted 6586-4 from under the hand 3027 of Judah 3063 unto this day. 3117 The same time 6256 [also] did Libnah 3841 revolt 6586-4 from under his hand; 3027 because he had forsaken 5800-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of his fathers. 1

21:11 Moreover he made 6213-1 high places 1116 in the mountains 2022 of Judah, 3063 and caused the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem 3389 to commit fornication, 2181-55 and compelled 5080-55 Judah 3063 [thereto].

21:12 And there came 935-4 a writing 4385 to him from Elijah 452 the prophet, 5030 saying, 559-2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of David 1732 thy father, 1 Because thou hast not walked 1980-1 in the ways 1870 of Jehoshaphat 3092 thy father, 1 nor in the ways 1870 of Asa 609 king 4428 of Judah, 3063

21:13 But hast walked 3212-4 in the way 1870 of the kings 4428 of Israel, 3478 and hast made Judah 3063 and the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem 3389 to go a whoring, 2181-55 like to the whoredoms 2181-53 of the house 1004 of Ahab, 256 and also hast slain 2026-1 thy brethren 251 of thy father's 1 house, 1004 [which were] better 2896 than thyself:

21:14 Behold, with a great 1419 plague 4046 will the LORD 3068 smite 5062-6 thy people, 5971 and thy children, 1121 and thy wives, 802 and all thy goods: 7399

21:15 And thou [shalt have] great 7227 sickness 2483 by disease 4245 of thy bowels, 4578 until thy bowels 4578 fall out 3318-4 by reason of the sickness 2483 day 3117 by day. 3117

21:16 Moreover the LORD 3068 stirred up 5782-55 against Jehoram 3088 the spirit 7307 of the Philistines, 6430 and of the Arabians, 6163 that [were] near 5921 3027 the Ethiopians: 3569

21:17 And they came up 5927-4 into Judah, 3063 and brake 1234-4 into it, and carried away 7617-4 all the substance 7399 that was found 4672-12 in the king's 4428 house, 1004 and his sons 1121 also, and his wives; 802 so that there was never a son 1121 left 7604-8 him, save Jehoahaz, 3059 the youngest 6996 of his sons. 1121

21:18 And after 310 all this the LORD 3068 smote 5062-1 him in his bowels 4578 with an incurable 369 4832 disease. 2483

21:19 And it came to pass, that in process of time, 3117 3117 after 3318-2 6256 the end 7093 of two 8147 years, 3117 his bowels 4578 fell out 3318-1 by reason 5973 of his sickness: 2483 so he died 4191-4 of sore 7451 diseases. 8463 And his people 5971 made 6213-1 no burning 8316 for him, like the burning 8316 of his fathers. 1

21:20 Thirty 7970 and two 8147 years old 1121 was he when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 in Jerusalem 3389 eight 8083 years, 8141 and departed 3212-4 without being desired. 2532 Howbeit they buried 6912-4 him in the city 5892 of David, 1732 but not in the sepulchres 6913 of the kings. 4428

22:1 And the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem 3389 made Ahaziah 274 his youngest 6996 son 1121 king 4427-55 in his stead: for the band of men 1416 that came 935-6 with the Arabians 6163 to the camp 4264 had slain 2026-1 all the eldest. 7223 So Ahaziah 274 the son 1121 of Jehoram 3088 king 4428 of Judah 3063 reigned. 4427-4

22:2 Forty 705 and two 8147 years 8141 old 1121 [was] Ahaziah 274 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 one 259 year 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 His mother's 517 name 8034 also [was] Athaliah 6271 the daughter 1323 of Omri. 6018

22:3 He also walked 1980-1 in the ways 1870 of the house 1004 of Ahab: 256 for his mother 517 was his counsellor 3289-6 to do wickedly. 7561-53

22:4 Wherefore he did 6213-4 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD 3068 like the house 1004 of Ahab: 256 for they were his counsellors 3289-6 after 310 the death 4194 of his father 1 to his destruction. 4889

22:5 He walked 1980-1 also after their counsel, 6098 and went 3212-4 with Jehoram 3088 the son 1121 of Ahab 256 king 4428 of Israel 3478 to war 4421 against Hazael 2371 king 4428 of Syria 758 at Ramothgilead: 7433 1568 and the Syrians 761|7421 smote 5221-55 Joram. 3141

22:6 And he returned 7725-4 to be healed 7495-99 in Jezreel 3157 because of the wounds 4347 which were given 5221-52 him at Ramah, 7414 when he fought 3898-9 with Hazael 2371 king 4428 of Syria. 758 And Azariah 5838 the son 1121 of Jehoram 3088 king 4428 of Judah 3063 went down 3381-1 to see 7200-2 Jehoram 3088 the son 1121 of Ahab 256 at Jezreel, 3157 because he was sick. 2470-6

22:7 And the destruction 8395 of Ahaziah 274 was of God 430 by coming 935-2 to Joram: 3141 for when he was come, 935-2 he went out 3318-1 with Jehoram 3088 against Jehu 3058 the son 1121 of Nimshi, 5250 whom the LORD 3068 had anointed 4886-1 to cut off 3772-53 the house 1004 of Ahab. 256

22:8 And it came to pass, that, when Jehu 3058 was executing judgment 8199-9 upon the house 1004 of Ahab, 256 and found 4672-4 the princes 8269 of Judah, 3063 and the sons 1121 of the brethren 251 of Ahaziah, 274 that ministered 8334-18 to Ahaziah, 274 he slew 2026-4 them.

22:9 And he sought 1245-17 Ahaziah: 274 and they caught 3920-4 him, (for he was hid 2244-102 in Samaria,) 8111 and brought 935-55 him to Jehu: 3058 and when they had slain 4191-55 him, they buried 6912-4 him: Because, said 559-1 they, he [is] the son 1121 of Jehoshaphat, 3092 who sought 1875-1 the LORD 3068 with all his heart. 3824 So the house 1004 of Ahaziah 274 had no power 3581 to keep 6113-2 still the kingdom. 4467

22:10 But when Athaliah 6271 the mother 517 of Ahaziah 274 saw 7200-1 that her son 1121 was dead, 4191-1 she arose 6965-4 and destroyed 1696-17 all the seed 2233 royal 4467 of the house 1004 of Judah. 3063

22:11 But Jehoshabeath, 3090 the daughter 1323 of the king, 4428 took 3947-4 Joash 3101 the son 1121 of Ahaziah, 274 and stole 1589-4 him from among 8432 the king's 4428 sons 1121 that were slain, 4191-94 and put 5414-4 him and his nurse 3243-56 in a bedchamber. 2315 4296 So Jehoshabeath, 3090 the daughter 1323 of king 4428 Jehoram, 3088 the wife 802 of Jehoiada 3077 the priest, 3548 (for she was the sister 269 of Ahaziah,) 274 hid 5641-55 him from 6440 Athaliah, 6271 so that she slew 4191-52 him not.

22:12 And he was with them hid 2244-102 in the house 1004 of God 430 six 8337 years: 8141 and Athaliah 6271 reigned 4427-6 over the land. 776

23:1 And in the seventh 7637 year 8141 Jehoiada 3077 strengthened 2388-98 himself, and took 3947-4 the captains 8269 of hundreds, 3967 Azariah 5838 the son 1121 of Jeroham, 3395 and Ishmael 3458 the son 1121 of Jehohanan, 3076 and Azariah 5838 the son 1121 of Obed, 5744 and Maaseiah 4641 the son 1121 of Adaiah, 5718 and Elishaphat 478 the son 1121 of Zichri, 2147 into covenant 1285 with him.

23:2 And they went about 5437-4 in Judah, 3063 and gathered 6908-4 the Levites 3881 out of all the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 and the chief 7218 of the fathers 1 of Israel, 3478 and they came 935-4 to Jerusalem. 3389

23:3 And all the congregation 6951 made 3772-4 a covenant 1285 with the king 4428 in the house 1004 of God. 430 And he said 559-4 unto them, Behold, the king's 4428 son 1121 shall reign, 4427-4 as the LORD 3068 hath said 1696-14 of the sons 1121 of David. 1732

23:4 This [is] the thing 1697 that ye shall do; 6213-4 A third part 7992 of you entering 935-6 on the sabbath, 7676 of the priests 3548 and of the Levites, 3881 [shall be] porters 7778 of the doors; 5592

23:5 And a third part 7992 [shall be] at the king's 4428 house; 1004 and a third part 7992 at the gate 8179 of the foundation: 3247 and all the people 5971 [shall be] in the courts 2691 of the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

23:6 But let none come 935-4 into the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 save the priests, 3548 and they that minister 8334-18 of the Levites; 3881 they shall go in, 935-4 for they [are] holy: 6944 but all the people 5971 shall keep 8104-4 the watch 4931 of the LORD. 3068

23:7 And the Levites 3881 shall compass 5362-52 the king 4428 round about, 5439 every man 376 with his weapons 3627 in his hand; 3027 and whosoever [else] cometh 935-6 into the house, 1004 he shall be put to death: 4191-93 but be ye with the king 4428 when he cometh in, 935-2 and when he goeth out. 3318-2

23:8 So the Levites 3881 and all Judah 3063 did 6213-4 according to all things that Jehoiada 3077 the priest 3548 had commanded, 6680-14 and took 3947-4 every man 376 his men 582 that were to come in 935-6 on the sabbath, 7676 with them that were to go 3318-6 [out] on the sabbath: 7676 for Jehoiada 3077 the priest 3548 dismissed 6362-1 not the courses. 4256

23:9 Moreover Jehoiada 3077 the priest 3548 delivered 5414-4 to the captains 8269 of hundreds 3967 spears, 2595 and bucklers, 4043 and shields, 7982 that [had been] king 4428 David's, 1732 which [were] in the house 1004 of God. 430

23:10 And he set 5975-55 all the people, 5971 every man 376 having his weapon 7973 in his hand, 3027 from the right 3233 side 3802 of the temple 1004 to the left 8042 side 3802 of the temple, 1004 along by the altar 4196 and the temple, 1004 by the king 4428 round about. 5439

23:11 Then they brought out 3318-55 the king's 4428 son, 1121 and put 5414-4 upon him the crown, 5145 and [gave him] the testimony, 5715 and made him king. 4427-55 And Jehoiada 3077 and his sons 1121 anointed 4886-4 him, and said, 559-4 God save 2421-4 the king. 4428

23:12 Now when Athaliah 6271 heard 8085-4 the noise 6963 of the people 5971 running 7323-5 and praising 1984-18 the king, 4428 she came 935-4 to the people 5971 into the house 1004 of the LORD: 3068

23:13 And she looked, 7200-4 and, behold, the king 4428 stood 5975-6 at his pillar 5982 at the entering in, 3996 and the princes 8269 and the trumpets 2689 by the king: 4428 and all the people 5971 of the land 776 rejoiced, 8056 and sounded 8628-6 with trumpets, 2689 also the singers 7891-35 with instruments 3627 of musick, 7892 and such as taught 3045-56 to sing praise. 1984-15 Then Athaliah 6271 rent 7167-4 her clothes, 899 and said, 559-4 Treason, 7195 Treason. 7195

23:14 Then Jehoiada 3077 the priest 3548 brought out 3318-55 the captains 8269 of hundreds 3967 that were set over 6485-7 the host, 2428 and said 559-4 unto them, Have her forth 3318-54 of 1004 the ranges: 7713 and whoso followeth 935-6 310 her, let him be slain 4191-93 with the sword. 2719 For the priest 3548 said, 559-1 Slay 4191-55 her not in the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

23:15 So they laid 7760-4 hands 3027 on her; and when she was come 935-4 to the entering 3996 of the horse 5483 gate 8179 by the king's 4428 house, 1004 they slew 4191-55 her there.

23:16 And Jehoiada 3077 made 3772-4 a covenant 1285 between him, and between all the people, 5971 and between the king, 4428 that they should be the LORD'S 3068 people. 5971

23:17 Then all the people 5971 went 935-4 to the house 1004 of Baal, 1168 and brake it down, 5422-4 and brake his altars 4196 and his images 6754 in pieces, 7665-14 and slew 2026-1 Mattan 4977 the priest 3548 of Baal 1168 before 6440 the altars. 4196

23:18 Also Jehoiada 3077 appointed 7760-4 the offices 6486 of the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 by the hand 3027 of the priests 3548 the Levites, 3881 whom David 1732 had distributed 2505-1 in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 to offer 5927-53 the burnt offerings 5930 of the LORD, 3068 as [it is] written 3789-7 in the law 8451 of Moses, 4872 with rejoicing 8057 and with singing, 7892 [as it was ordained] by 3027 David. 1732

23:19 And he set 5975-55 the porters 7778 at the gates 8179 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 that none [which was] unclean 2931 in any thing 1697 should enter in. 935-4

23:20 And he took 3947-4 the captains 8269 of hundreds, 3967 and the nobles, 117 and the governors 4910-6 of the people, 5971 and all the people 5971 of the land, 776 and brought down 3381-55 the king 4428 from the house 1004 of the LORD: 3068 and they came 935-4 through 8432 the high 5945 gate 8179 into the king's 4428 house, 1004 and set 3427-55 the king 4428 upon the throne 3678 of the kingdom. 4467

23:21 And all the people 5971 of the land 776 rejoiced: 8055-4 and the city 5892 was quiet, 8252-1 after that they had slain 4191-52 Athaliah 6271 with the sword. 2719

24:1 Joash 3101 [was] seven 7651 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 forty 705 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 His mother's 517 name 8034 also [was] Zibiah 6645 of Beersheba. 884

24:2 And Joash 3101 did 6213-4 [that which was] right 3477 in the sight 5869 of the LORD 3068 all the days 3117 of Jehoiada 3077 the priest. 3548

24:3 And Jehoiada 3077 took 5375-4 for him two 8147 wives; 802 and he begat 3205-55 sons 1121 and daughters. 1323

24:4 And it came to pass after 310 this, [that] Joash 3101 was minded 3820 to repair 2318-15 the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

24:5 And he gathered together 6908-4 the priests 3548 and the Levites, 3881 and said 559-4 to them, Go out 3318-3 unto the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 and gather 6908-3 of all Israel 3478 money 3701 to repair 2388-15 the house 1004 of your God 430 from 1767 year 8141 to year, 8141 and see that ye hasten 4116-17 the matter. 1697 Howbeit the Levites 3881 hastened 4116-14 [it] not.

24:6 And the king 4428 called 7121-4 for Jehoiada 3077 the chief, 7218 and said 559-4 unto him, Why hast thou not required 1875-1 of the Levites 3881 to bring in 935-53 out of Judah 3063 and out of Jerusalem 3389 the collection, 4864 [according to the commandment] of Moses 4872 the servant 5650 of the LORD, 3068 and of the congregation 6951 of Israel, 3478 for the tabernacle 168 of witness? 5715

24:7 For the sons 1121 of Athaliah, 6271 that wicked 4849 woman, had broken up 6555-1 the house 1004 of God; 430 and also all the dedicated things 6944 of the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 did they bestow 6213-1 upon Baalim. 1168

24:8 And at the king's 4428 commandment 559-4 they made 6213-4 a 259 chest, 727 and set 5414-4 it without 2351 at the gate 8179 of the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

24:9 And they made 5414-4 a proclamation 6963 through Judah 3063 and Jerusalem, 3389 to bring in 935-53 to the LORD 3068 the collection 4864 [that] Moses 4872 the servant 5650 of God 430 [laid] upon Israel 3478 in the wilderness. 4057

24:10 And all the princes 8269 and all the people 5971 rejoiced, 8055-4 and brought in, 935-55 and cast 7993-55 into the chest, 727 until they had made an end. 3615-15

24:11 Now it came to pass, that at what time 6256 the chest 727 was brought 935-55 unto the king's 4428 office 6486 by the hand 3027 of the Levites, 3881 and when they saw 7200-2 that [there was] much 7227 money, 3701 the king's 4428 scribe 5608-6 and the high 7218 priest's 3548 officer 6496 came 935-1 and emptied 6168-17 the chest, 727 and took 5375-4 it, and carried it to his place 4725 again. 7725-55 Thus they did 6213-1 day 3117 by day, 3117 and gathered 622-4 money 3701 in abundance. 7230

24:12 And the king 4428 and Jehoiada 3077 gave 5414-4 it to such as did 6213-6 the work 4399 of the service 5656 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and hired 7936-6 masons 2672-6 and carpenters 2796 to repair 2318-15 the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and also such as wrought 2796 iron 1270 and brass 5178 to mend 2388-15 the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

24:13 So the workmen 4399 6213-6 wrought, 6213-4 and the work 4399 was 5927-4 perfected 724 by them, 3027 and they set 5975-55 the house 1004 of God 430 in his state, 4971 and strengthened 553-17 it.

24:14 And when they had finished 3615-15 [it], they brought 935-52 the rest 7605 of the money 3701 before 6440 the king 4428 and Jehoiada, 3077 whereof were made 6213-4 vessels 3627 for the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 [even] vessels 3627 to minister, 8335 and to offer 5927-53 [withal], and spoons, 3709 and vessels 3627 of gold 2091 and silver. 3701 And they offered 5927-56 burnt offerings 5930 in the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 continually 8548 all the days 3117 of Jehoiada. 3077

24:15 But Jehoiada 3077 waxed old, 2204-4 and was full 7646-4 of days 3117 when he died; 4191-4 an hundred 3967 and thirty 7970 years 8141 old 1121 [was he] when he died. 4194

24:16 And they buried 6912-4 him in the city 5892 of David 1732 among the kings, 4428 because he had done 6213-1 good 2896 in Israel, 3478 both toward God, 430 and toward his house. 1004

24:17 Now after 310 the death 4194 of Jehoiada 3077 came 935-1 the princes 8269 of Judah, 3063 and made obeisance 7812-101 to the king. 4428 Then the king 4428 hearkened 8085-1 unto them.

24:18 And they left 5800-4 the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 God 430 of their fathers, 1 and served 5647-4 groves 842 and idols: 6091 and wrath 7110 came upon Judah 3063 and Jerusalem 3389 for this their trespass. 819

24:19 Yet he sent 7971-4 prophets 5030 to them, to bring them again 7725-53 unto the LORD; 3068 and they testified 5749-55 against them: but they would not give ear. 238-52

24:20 And the Spirit 7307 of God 430 came upon 3847-1 Zechariah 2148 the son 1121 of Jehoiada 3077 the priest, 3548 which stood 5975-4 above the people, 5971 and said 559-4 unto them, Thus saith 559-1 God, 430 Why transgress 5674-6 ye the commandments 4687 of the LORD, 3068 that ye cannot prosper? 6743-55 because ye have forsaken 5800-1 the LORD, 3068 he hath also forsaken 5800-4 you.

24:21 And they conspired 7194-4 against him, and stoned 7275-4 him with stones 68 at the commandment 4687 of the king 4428 in the court 2691 of the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

24:22 Thus Joash 3101 the king 4428 remembered 2142-1 not the kindness 2617 which Jehoiada 3077 his father 1 had done 6213-1 to him, but slew 2026-4 his son. 1121 And when he died, 4194 he said, 559-1 The LORD 3068 look 7200-4 upon [it], and require 1875-4 [it].

24:23 And it came to pass at the end 8622 of the year, 8141 [that] the host 2428 of Syria 758 came up 5927-1 against him: and they came 935-4 to Judah 3063 and Jerusalem, 3389 and destroyed 7843-55 all the princes 8269 of the people 5971 from among the people, 5971 and sent 7971-14 all the spoil 7998 of them unto the king 4428 of Damascus. 1834

24:24 For the army 2428 of the Syrians 758 came 935-1 with a small 4705 company of men, 582 and the LORD 3068 delivered 5414-1 a very 3966 great 7230 host 2428 into their hand, 3027 because they had forsaken 5800-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of their fathers. 1 So they executed 6213-1 judgment 8201 against Joash. 3101

24:25 And when they were departed 3212-2 from him, (for they left 5800-1 him in great 7227 diseases,) 4251 his own servants 5650 conspired 7194-98 against him for the blood 1818 of the sons 1121 of Jehoiada 3077 the priest, 3548 and slew 2026-4 him on his bed, 4296 and he died: 4191-4 and they buried 6912-4 him in the city 5892 of David, 1732 but they buried 6912-1 him not in the sepulchres 6913 of the kings. 4428

24:26 And these are they that conspired 7194-102 against him; Zabad 2066 the son 1121 of Shimeath 8100 an Ammonitess, 5984 and Jehozabad 3075 the son 1121 of Shimrith 8116 a Moabitess. 4125

24:27 Now [concerning] his sons, 1121 and the greatness 7235-4|7230-k of the burdens 4853 [laid] upon him, and the repairing 3247 of the house 1004 of God, 430 behold, they [are] written 3789-7 in the story 4097 of the book 5612 of the kings. 4428 And Amaziah 558 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

25:1 Amaziah 558 [was] twenty 6242 and five 2568 years 8141 old 1121 [when] he began to reign, 4427-1 and he reigned 4427-1 twenty 6242 and nine 8672 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Jehoaddan 3086 of Jerusalem. 3389

25:2 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] right 3477 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 but not with a perfect 8003 heart. 3824

25:3 Now it came to pass, when the kingdom 4467 was established 2388-1 to him, that he slew 2026-4 his servants 5650 that had killed 5221-56 the king 4428 his father. 1

25:4 But he slew 4191-52 not their children, 1121 but [did] as [it is] written 3789-7 in the law 8451 in the book 5612 of Moses, 4872 where the LORD 3068 commanded, 6680-14 saying, 559-2 The fathers 1 shall not die 4191-4 for the children, 1121 neither shall the children 1121 die 4191-4 for the fathers, 1 but every man 376 shall die 4191-4 for his own sin. 2399

25:5 Moreover Amaziah 558 gathered Judah 3063 together, 6908-4 and made 5975-55 them captains 8269 over thousands, 505 and captains 8269 over hundreds, 3967 according to the houses 1004 of [their] fathers, 1 throughout all Judah 3063 and Benjamin: 1144 and he numbered 6485-4 them from twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 and above, 4605 and found 4672-4 them three 7969 hundred 3967 thousand 505 choice 977-7 [men, able] to go forth 3318-6 to war, 6635 that could handle 270-6 spear 7420 and shield. 6793

25:6 He hired 7936-4 also an hundred 3967 thousand 505 mighty men 1368 of valour 2428 out of Israel 3478 for an hundred 3967 talents 3603 of silver. 3701

25:7 But there came 935-1 a man 376 of God 430 to him, saying, 559-2 O king, 4428 let not the army 6635 of Israel 3478 go 935-4 with thee; for the LORD 3068 [is] not with Israel, 3478 [to wit, with] all the children 1121 of Ephraim. 669

25:8 But if thou wilt go, 935-3 do 6213-3 [it], be strong 2388-3 for the battle: 4421 God 430 shall make thee fall 3782-55 before 6440 the enemy: 341-6 for God 430 hath 3426 power 3581 to help, 5826-2 and to cast down. 3782-53

25:9 And Amaziah 558 said 559-4 to the man 376 of God, 430 But what shall we do 6213-2 for the hundred 3967 talents 3603 which I have given 5414-1 to the army 1416 of Israel? 3478 And the man 376 of God 430 answered, 559-4 The LORD 3068 is 3426 able to give 5414-2 thee much more 7235-53 than this.

25:10 Then Amaziah 558 separated 914-55 them, [to wit], the army 1416 that was come 935-1 to him out of Ephraim, 669 to go 3212-2 home 4725 again: wherefore their anger 639 was greatly 3966 kindled 2734-4 against Judah, 3063 and they returned 7725-4 home 4725 in great 2750 anger. 639

25:11 And Amaziah 558 strengthened 2388-98 himself, and led forth 5090-4 his people, 5971 and went 3212-4 to the valley 1516 of salt, 4417 and smote 5221-55 of the children 1121 of Seir 8165 ten 6235 thousand. 505

25:12 And [other] ten 6235 thousand 505 [left] alive 2416 did the children 1121 of Judah 3063 carry away captive, 7617-1 and brought 935-55 them unto the top 7218 of the rock, 5553 and cast them down 7993-55 from the top 7218 of the rock, 5553 that they all were broken in pieces. 1234-8

25:13 But the soldiers 1121 of the army 1416 which Amaziah 558 sent back, 7725-52 that they should not go 3212-2 with him to battle, 4421 fell 6584-4 upon the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 from Samaria 8111 even unto Bethhoron, 1032 and smote 5221-55 three 7969 thousand 505 of them, and took 962-4 much 7227 spoil. 961

25:14 Now it came to pass, after 310 that Amaziah 558 was come 935-2 from the slaughter 5221-53 of the Edomites, 130 that he brought 935-55 the gods 430 of the children 1121 of Seir, 8165 and set them up 5975-55 [to be] his gods, 430 and bowed down 7812-101 himself before 6440 them, and burned incense 6999-17 unto them.

25:15 Wherefore the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 was kindled 2734-4 against Amaziah, 558 and he sent 7971-4 unto him a prophet, 5030 which said 559-4 unto him, Why hast thou sought 1875-1 after the gods 430 of the people, 5971 which could not deliver 5337-52 their own people 5971 out of thine hand? 3027

25:16 And it came to pass, as he talked 1696-15 with him, that [the king] said 559-4 unto him, Art thou made 5414-1 of the king's 4428 counsel? 3289-6 forbear; 2308-3 why shouldest thou be smitten? 5221-55 Then the prophet 5030 forbare, 2308-4 and said, 559-4 I know 3045-1 that God 430 hath determined 3289-1 to destroy 7843-53 thee, because thou hast done 6213-1 this, and hast not hearkened 8085-1 unto my counsel. 6098

25:17 Then Amaziah 558 king 4428 of Judah 3063 took advice, 3289-11 and sent 7971-4 to Joash, 3101 the son 1121 of Jehoahaz, 3059 the son 1121 of Jehu, 3058 king 4428 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 Come, 3212-3 let us see 7200-101 one another in the face. 6440

25:18 And Joash 3101 king 4428 of Israel 3478 sent 7971-4 to Amaziah 558 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 saying, 559-2 The thistle 2336 that [was] in Lebanon 3844 sent 7971-1 to the cedar 730 that [was] in Lebanon, 3844 saying, 559-2 Give 5414-3 thy daughter 1323 to my son 1121 to wife: 802 and there passed by 5674-4 a wild 7704 beast 2416 that [was] in Lebanon, 3844 and trode down 7429-4 the thistle. 2336

25:19 Thou sayest, 559-1 Lo, thou hast smitten 5221-52 the Edomites; 123 and thine heart 3820 lifteth thee up 5375-1 to boast: 3513-53 abide 3427-3 now at home; 1004 why shouldest thou meddle 1624-101 to [thine] hurt, 7451 that thou shouldest fall, 5307-1 [even] thou, and Judah 3063 with thee?

25:20 But Amaziah 558 would not hear; 8085-1 for it [came] of God, 430 that he might deliver 5414-2 them into the hand 3027 [of their enemies], because they sought 1875-1 after the gods 430 of Edom. 123

25:21 So Joash 3101 the king 4428 of Israel 3478 went up; 5927-4 and they saw 7200-101 one another in the face, 6440 [both] he and Amaziah 558 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 at Bethshemesh, 1053 which [belongeth] to Judah. 3063

25:22 And Judah 3063 was put to the worse 5062-11 before 6440 Israel, 3478 and they fled 5127-4 every man 376 to his tent. 168

25:23 And Joash 3101 the king 4428 of Israel 3478 took 8610-1 Amaziah 558 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 the son 1121 of Joash, 3101 the son 1121 of Jehoahaz, 3059 at Bethshemesh, 1053 and brought 935-55 him to Jerusalem, 3389 and brake down 6555-4 the wall 2346 of Jerusalem 3389 from the gate 8179 of Ephraim 669 to the corner 6437-6 gate, 8179 four 702 hundred 3967 cubits. 520

25:24 And [he took] all the gold 2091 and the silver, 3701 and all the vessels 3627 that were found 4672-12 in the house 1004 of God 430 with Obededom, 5654 and the treasures 214 of the king's 4428 house, 1004 the hostages 1121 8594 also, and returned 7725-4 to Samaria. 8111

25:25 And Amaziah 558 the son 1121 of Joash 3101 king 4428 of Judah 3063 lived 2421-4 after 310 the death 4194 of Joash 3101 son 1121 of Jehoahaz 3059 king 4428 of Israel 3478 fifteen 2568 6240 years. 8141

25:26 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Amaziah, 558 first 7223 and last, 314 behold, [are] they not written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the kings 4428 of Judah 3063 and Israel? 3478

25:27 Now after the time 6256 that Amaziah 558 did turn away 5493-1 from following 310 the LORD 3068 they made 7194-4 a conspiracy 7195 against him in Jerusalem; 3389 and he fled 5127-4 to Lachish: 3923 but they sent 7971-4 to Lachish 3923 after 310 him, and slew 4191-55 him there.

25:28 And they brought 5375-4 him upon horses, 5483 and buried 6912-4 him with his fathers 1 in the city 5892 of Judah. 3063

26:1 Then all the people 5971 of Judah 3063 took 3947-4 Uzziah, 5818 who [was] sixteen 8337 6240 years 8141 old, 1121 and made him king 4427-55 in the room of his father 1 Amaziah. 558

26:2 He built 1129-1 Eloth, 359 and restored 7725-55 it to Judah, 3063 after 310 that the king 4428 slept 7901-2 with his fathers. 1

26:3 Sixteen 8337 6240 years 8141 old 1121 [was] Uzziah 5818 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 fifty 2572 and two 8147 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 His mother's 517 name 8034 also [was] Jecoliah 3203 of Jerusalem. 3389

26:4 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] right 3477 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 according to all that his father 1 Amaziah 558 did. 6213-1

26:5 And he sought 1875-2 God 430 in the days 3117 of Zechariah, 2148 who had understanding 995-56 in the visions 7200-2 of God: 430 and as long as 3117 he sought 1875-2 the LORD, 3068 God 430 made him to prosper. 6743-52

26:6 And he went forth 3318-4 and warred 3898-11 against the Philistines, 6430 and brake down 6555-4 the wall 2346 of Gath, 1661 and the wall 2346 of Jabneh, 2996 and the wall 2346 of Ashdod, 795 and built 1129-4 cities 5892 about Ashdod, 795 and among the Philistines. 6430

26:7 And God 430 helped 5826-4 him against the Philistines, 6430 and against the Arabians 6163 that dwelt 3427-6 in Gurbaal, 1485 and the Mehunims. 4586

26:8 And the Ammonites 5984 gave 5414-4 gifts 4503 to Uzziah: 5818 and his name 8034 spread 3212-4 abroad [even] to the entering in 935-2 of Egypt; 4714 for he strengthened 2388-52 [himself] exceedingly. 4605

26:9 Moreover Uzziah 5818 built 1129-4 towers 4026 in Jerusalem 3389 at the corner 6438 gate, 8179 and at the valley 1516 gate, 8179 and at the turning 4740 [of the wall], and fortified 2388-17 them.

26:10 Also he built 1129-4 towers 4026 in the desert, 4057 and digged 2672-4 many 7227 wells: 953 for he had much 7227 cattle, 4735 both in the low country, 8219 and in the plains: 4334 husbandmen 406 [also], and vine dressers 3755 in the mountains, 2022 and in Carmel: 3760 for he loved 157-6 husbandry. 127

26:11 Moreover Uzziah 5818 had an host 2428 of fighting 4421 men, 6213-6 that went out 3318-6 to war 6635 by bands, 1416 according to the number 4557 of their account 6486 by the hand 3027 of Jeiel 3273 the scribe 5608-6 and Maaseiah 4641 the ruler, 7860-6 under the hand 3027 of Hananiah, 2608 [one] of the king's 4428 captains. 8269

26:12 The whole number 4557 of the chief 7218 of the fathers 1 of the mighty men 1368 of valour 2428 [were] two thousand 505 and six 8337 hundred. 3967

26:13 And under their hand 3027 [was] an army, 2428 6635 three 7969 hundred 3967 thousand 505 and seven 7651 thousand 505 and five 2568 hundred, 3967 that made 6213-6 war 4421 with mighty 2428 power, 3581 to help 5826-2 the king 4428 against the enemy. 341-6

26:14 And Uzziah 5818 prepared 3559-55 for them throughout all the host 6635 shields, 4043 and spears, 7420 and helmets, 3553 and habergeons, 8302 and bows, 7198 and slings 7050 [to cast] stones. 68

26:15 And he made 6213-4 in Jerusalem 3389 engines, 2810 invented 4284 by cunning men, 2803-6 to be on the towers 4026 and upon the bulwarks, 6438 to shoot 3384-2 arrows 2671 and great 1419 stones 68 withal. And his name 8034 spread 3318-4 far abroad; 7350 for he was marvellously 6381-52 helped, 5826-9 till 3588 he was strong. 2388-1

26:16 But when he was strong, 2394 his heart 3820 was lifted up 1361-1 to [his] destruction: 7843-53 for he transgressed 4603-4 against the LORD 3068 his God, 430 and went 935-4 into the temple 1964 of the LORD 3068 to burn incense 6999-53 upon the altar 4196 of incense. 7004

26:17 And Azariah 5838 the priest 3548 went in 935-4 after 310 him, and with him fourscore 8084 priests 3548 of the LORD, 3068 [that were] valiant 2428 men: 1121

26:18 And they withstood 5975-4 Uzziah 5818 the king, 4428 and said 559-4 unto him, [It appertaineth] not unto thee, Uzziah, 5818 to burn incense 6999-53 unto the LORD, 3068 but to the priests 3548 the sons 1121 of Aaron, 175 that are consecrated 6942-30 to burn incense: 6999-53 go out 3318-3 of the sanctuary; 4720 for thou hast trespassed; 4603-1 neither [shall it be] for thine honour 3519 from the LORD 3068 God. 430

26:19 Then Uzziah 5818 was wroth, 2196-4 and [had] a censer 4730 in his hand 3027 to burn incense: 6999-53 and while he was wroth 2196-2 with the priests, 3548 the leprosy 6883 even rose up 2224-1 in his forehead 4696 before 6440 the priests 3548 in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 from beside the incense 7004 altar. 4196

26:20 And Azariah 5838 the chief 7218 priest, 3548 and all the priests, 3548 looked 6437-4 upon him, and, behold, he [was] leprous 6879-30 in his forehead, 4696 and they thrust him out 926-55 from thence; yea, himself hasted 1765-8 also to go out, 3318-2 because the LORD 3068 had smitten 5060-14 him.

26:21 And Uzziah 5818 the king 4428 was a leper 6879-30 unto the day 3117 of his death, 4194 and dwelt 3427-4 in a several 2669|2669-k house, 1004 [being] a leper; 6879-30 for he was cut off 1504-8 from the house 1004 of the LORD: 3068 and Jotham 3147 his son 1121 [was] over the king's 4428 house, 1004 judging 8199-6 the people 5971 of the land. 776

26:22 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Uzziah, 5818 first 7223 and last, 314 did Isaiah 3470 the prophet, 5030 the son 1121 of Amoz, 531 write. 3789-1

26:23 So Uzziah 5818 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and they buried 6912-4 him with his fathers 1 in the field 7704 of the burial 6900 which [belonged] to the kings; 4428 for they said, 559-1 He [is] a leper: 6879-30 and Jotham 3147 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

27:1 Jotham 3147 [was] twenty 6242 and five 2568 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 sixteen 8337 6240 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 His mother's 517 name 8034 also [was] Jerushah, 3388 the daughter 1323 of Zadok. 6659

27:2 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] right 3477 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 according to all that his father 1 Uzziah 5818 did: 6213-1 howbeit he entered 935-1 not into the temple 1964 of the LORD. 3068 And the people 5971 did yet corruptly. 7843-56

27:3 He built 1129-1 the high 5945 gate 8179 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and on the wall 2346 of Ophel 6077|6076 he built 1129-1 much. 7230

27:4 Moreover he built 1129-1 cities 5892 in the mountains 2022 of Judah, 3063 and in the forests 2793 he built 1129-1 castles 1003 and towers. 4026

27:5 He fought 3898-8 also with the king 4428 of the Ammonites, 1121 5983 and prevailed 2388-4 against them. And the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 gave 5414-4 him the same year 8141 an hundred 3967 talents 3603 of silver, 3701 and ten 6235 thousand 505 measures 3734 of wheat, 2406 and ten 6235 thousand 505 of barley. 8184 So much 2063 did the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 pay 7725-52 unto him, both the second 8145 year, 8141 and the third. 7992

27:6 So Jotham 3147 became mighty, 2388-101 because he prepared 3559-52 his ways 1870 before 6440 the LORD 3068 his God. 430

27:7 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Jotham, 3147 and all his wars, 4421 and his ways, 1870 lo, they [are] written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the kings 4428 of Israel 3478 and Judah. 3063

27:8 He was five 2568 and twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and reigned 4427-1 sixteen 8337 6240 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389

27:9 And Jotham 3147 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and they buried 6912-4 him in the city 5892 of David: 1732 and Ahaz 271 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

28:1 Ahaz 271 [was] twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 sixteen 8337 6240 years 8141 in Jerusalem: 3389 but he did 6213-1 not [that which was] right 3477 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 like David 1732 his father: 1

28:2 For he walked in 3212-4 the ways 1870 of the kings 4428 of Israel, 3478 and made 6213-1 also molten images 4541 for Baalim. 1168

28:3 Moreover he burnt incense 6999-52 in the valley 1516 of the son 1121 of Hinnom, 2011 and burnt 1197-55 his children 1121 in the fire, 784 after the abominations 8441 of the heathen 1471 whom the LORD 3068 had cast out 3423-52 before 6440 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

28:4 He sacrificed 2076-17 also and burnt incense 6999-17 in the high places, 1116 and on the hills, 1389 and under every green 7488 tree. 6086

28:5 Wherefore the LORD 3068 his God 430 delivered 5414-4 him into the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Syria; 758 and they smote 5221-55 him, and carried away 7617-4 a great 1419 multitude of them captives, 7633 and brought 935-55 [them] to Damascus. 1834 And he was also delivered 5414-12 into the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Israel, 3478 who smote 5221-55 him with a great 1419 slaughter. 4347

28:6 For Pekah 6492 the son 1121 of Remaliah 7425 slew 2026-4 in Judah 3063 an hundred 3967 and twenty 6242 thousand 505 in one 259 day, 3117 [which were] all valiant 2428 men; 1121 because they had forsaken 5800-2 the LORD 3068 God 430 of their fathers. 1

28:7 And Zichri, 2147 a mighty man 1368 of Ephraim, 669 slew 2026-4 Maaseiah 4641 the king's 4428 son, 1121 and Azrikam 5840 the governor 5057 of the house, 1004 and Elkanah 511 [that was] next 4932 to the king. 4428

28:8 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 carried away 7617-4 captive of their brethren 251 two hundred 3967 thousand, 505 women, 802 sons, 1121 and daughters, 1323 and took also away 962-1 much 7227 spoil 7998 from them, and brought 935-55 the spoil 7998 to Samaria. 8111

28:9 But a prophet 5030 of the LORD 3068 was there, whose name 8034 [was] Oded: 5752 and he went out 3318-4 before 6440 the host 6635 that came 935-6 to Samaria, 8111 and said 559-4 unto them, Behold, because the LORD 3068 God 430 of your fathers 1 was wroth 2534 with Judah, 3063 he hath delivered 5414-1 them into your hand, 3027 and ye have slain 2026-4 them in a rage 2197 [that] reacheth up 5060-52 unto heaven. 8064

28:10 And now ye purpose 559-6 to keep under 3533-2 the children 1121 of Judah 3063 and Jerusalem 3389 for bondmen 5650 and bondwomen 8198 unto you: [but are there] not with you, even 7535 with you, sins 819 against the LORD 3068 your God? 430

28:11 Now hear 8085-3 me therefore, and deliver 7725-54 the captives 7633 again, which ye have taken captive 7617-1 of your brethren: 251 for the fierce 2740 wrath 639 of the LORD 3068 [is] upon you.

28:12 Then certain 582 of the heads 7218 of the children 1121 of Ephraim, 669 Azariah 5838 the son 1121 of Johanan, 3076 Berechiah 1296 the son 1121 of Meshillemoth, 4919 and Jehizkiah 3169 the son 1121 of Shallum, 7967 and Amasa 6021 the son 1121 of Hadlai, 2311 stood up 6965-4 against them that came 935-6 from the war, 6635

28:13 And said 559-4 unto them, Ye shall not bring in 935-55 the captives 7633 hither: for whereas we have offended 819 against the LORD 3068 [already], ye intend 559-6 to add 3254-53 [more] to our sins 2403 and to our trespass: 819 for our trespass 819 is great, 7227 and [there is] fierce 2740 wrath 639 against Israel. 3478

28:14 So the armed 2502-7 men left 5800-4 the captives 7633 and the spoil 961 before 6440 the princes 8269 and all the congregation. 6951

28:15 And the men 582 which were expressed 5344-8 by name 8034 rose up, 6965-4 and took 2388-55 the captives, 7633 and with the spoil 7998 clothed 3847-52 all that were naked 4636 among them, and arrayed 3847-55 them, and shod 5274-55 them, and gave them to eat 398-55 and to drink, 8248-55 and anointed 5480-4 them, and carried 5095-17 all the feeble 3782-6 of them upon asses, 2543 and brought 935-55 them to Jericho, 3405 the city of palm trees, 5892|8558|5899 to 681 their brethren: 251 then they returned 7725-4 to Samaria. 8111

28:16 At that time 6256 did king 4428 Ahaz 271 send 7971-1 unto the kings 4428 of Assyria 804 to help 5826-2 him.

28:17 For again the Edomites 130 had come 935-1 and smitten 5221-55 Judah, 3063 and carried away 7617-4 captives. 7628

28:18 The Philistines 6430 also had invaded 6584-1 the cities 5892 of the low country, 8219 and of the south 5045 of Judah, 3063 and had taken 3920-4 Bethshemesh, 1053 and Ajalon, 357 and Gederoth, 1450 and Shocho 7755 with the villages 1323 thereof, and Timnah 8553 with the villages 1323 thereof, Gimzo 1579 also and the villages 1323 thereof: and they dwelt 3427-4 there.

28:19 For the LORD 3068 brought Judah 3063 low 3665-52 because of Ahaz 271 king 4428 of Israel; 3478 for he made Judah 3063 naked, 6544-52 and transgressed 4603-2 sore 4604 against the LORD. 3068

28:20 And Tilgathpilneser 8407 king 4428 of Assyria 804 came 935-4 unto him, and distressed 6696-4 him, but strengthened 2388-1 him not.

28:21 For Ahaz 271 took away a portion 2505-1 [out] of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and [out] of the house 1004 of the king, 4428 and of the princes, 8269 and gave 5414-4 [it] unto the king 4428 of Assyria: 804 but he helped 5833 him not.

28:22 And in the time 6256 of his distress 6887-53 did he trespass 4603-2 yet more 3254-55 against the LORD: 3068 this [is that] king 4428 Ahaz. 271

28:23 For he sacrificed 2076-4 unto the gods 430 of Damascus, 1834 which smote 5221-56 him: and he said, 559-4 Because the gods 430 of the kings 4428 of Syria 758 help 5826-56 them, [therefore] will I sacrifice 2076-17 to them, that they may help 5826-4 me. But they were the ruin 3782-53 of him, and of all Israel. 3478

28:24 And Ahaz 271 gathered 622-4 together the vessels 3627 of the house 1004 of God, 430 and cut in pieces 7112-17 the vessels 3627 of the house 1004 of God, 430 and shut up 5462-4 the doors 1817 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and he made 6213-4 him altars 4196 in every corner 6438 of Jerusalem. 3389

28:25 And in every several city 5892 5892 of Judah 3063 he made 6213-1 high places 1116 to burn incense 6999-15 unto other 312 gods, 430 and provoked to anger 3707-55 the LORD 3068 God 430 of his fathers. 1

28:26 Now the rest 3499 of his acts 1697 and of all his ways, 1870 first 7223 and last, 314 behold, they [are] written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the kings 4428 of Judah 3063 and Israel. 3478

28:27 And Ahaz 271 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and they buried 6912-4 him in the city, 5892 [even] in Jerusalem: 3389 but they brought 935-52 him not into the sepulchres 6913 of the kings 4428 of Israel: 3478 and Hezekiah 3169 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

29:1 Hezekiah 3169 began to reign 4427-1 [when he was] five 2568 and twenty 6242 years 8141 old, 1121 and he reigned 4427-1 nine 8672 and twenty 6242 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389 And his mother's 517 name 8034 [was] Abijah, 29 the daughter 1323 of Zechariah. 2148

29:2 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] right 3477 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 according to all that David 1732 his father 1 had done. 6213-1

29:3 He in the first 7223 year 8141 of his reign, 4427-2 in the first 7223 month, 2320 opened 6605-1 the doors 1817 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and repaired 2388-17 them.

29:4 And he brought in 935-55 the priests 3548 and the Levites, 3881 and gathered 622-4 them together into the east 4217 street, 7339

29:5 And said 559-4 unto them, Hear 8085-3 me, ye Levites, 3881 sanctify 6942-100 now yourselves, and sanctify 6942-16 the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 God 430 of your fathers, 1 and carry forth 3318-54 the filthiness 5079 out of the holy 6944 [place].

29:6 For our fathers 1 have trespassed, 4603-1 and done 6213-1 [that which was] evil 7451 in the eyes 5869 of the LORD 3068 our God, 430 and have forsaken 5800-4 him, and have turned away 5437-55 their faces 6440 from the habitation 4908 of the LORD, 3068 and turned 5414-4 [their] backs. 6203

29:7 Also they have shut up 5462-1 the doors 1817 of the porch, 197 and put out 3518-17 the lamps, 5216 and have not burned 6999-52 incense 7004 nor offered 5927-52 burnt offerings 5930 in the holy 6944 [place] unto the God 430 of Israel. 3478

29:8 Wherefore the wrath 7110 of the LORD 3068 was upon Judah 3063 and Jerusalem, 3389 and he hath delivered 5414-4 them to trouble, 2189|2113-k to astonishment, 8047 and to hissing, 8322 as ye see 7200-6 with your eyes. 5869

29:9 For, lo, our fathers 1 have fallen 5307-1 by the sword, 2719 and our sons 1121 and our daughters 1323 and our wives 802 [are] in captivity 7628 for this.

29:10 Now [it is] in mine heart 3824 to make 3772-2 a covenant 1285 with the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 that his fierce 2740 wrath 639 may turn away 7725-4 from us.

29:11 My sons, 1121 be not now negligent: 7952-11 for the LORD 3068 hath chosen 977-1 you to stand 5975-2 before 6440 him, to serve 8334-15 him, and that ye should minister 8334-18 unto him, and burn incense. 6999-56

29:12 Then the Levites 3881 arose, 6965-4 Mahath 4287 the son 1121 of Amasai, 6022 and Joel 3100 the son 1121 of Azariah, 5838 of the sons 1121 of the Kohathites: 6956 and of the sons 1121 of Merari, 4847 Kish 7027 the son 1121 of Abdi, 5660 and Azariah 5838 the son 1121 of Jehalelel: 3094 and of the Gershonites; 1649 Joah 3098 the son 1121 of Zimmah, 2155 and Eden 5731 the son 1121 of Joah: 3098

29:13 And of the sons 1121 of Elizaphan; 469 Shimri, 8113 and Jeiel: 3273 and of the sons 1121 of Asaph; 623 Zechariah, 2148 and Mattaniah: 4983

29:14 And of the sons 1121 of Heman; 1968 Jehiel, 3171 and Shimei: 8096 and of the sons 1121 of Jeduthun; 3038 Shemaiah, 8098 and Uzziel. 5816

29:15 And they gathered 622-4 their brethren, 251 and sanctified 6942-101 themselves, and came, 935-4 according to the commandment 4687 of the king, 4428 by the words 1697 of the LORD, 3068 to cleanse 2891-15 the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

29:16 And the priests 3548 went 935-4 into the inner part 6441 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 to cleanse 2891-15 [it], and brought out 3318-55 all the uncleanness 2932 that they found 4672-1 in the temple 1964 of the LORD 3068 into the court 2691 of the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068 And the Levites 3881 took 6901-17 [it], to carry [it] out 3318-53 abroad 2351 into the brook 5158 Kidron. 6939

29:17 Now they began 2490-55 on the first 259 [day] of the first 7223 month 2320 to sanctify, 6942-15 and on the eighth 8083 day 3117 of the month 2320 came 935-1 they to the porch 197 of the LORD: 3068 so they sanctified 6942-17 the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 in eight 8083 days; 3117 and in the sixteenth 8337 6240 day 3117 of the first 7223 month 2320 they made an end. 3615-14

29:18 Then they went 935-4 in 6441 to Hezekiah 2396 the king, 4428 and said, 559-4 We have cleansed 2891-14 all the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and the altar 4196 of burnt offering, 5930 with all the vessels 3627 thereof, and the shewbread 4635 table, 7979 with all the vessels 3627 thereof.

29:19 Moreover all the vessels, 3627 which king 4428 Ahaz 271 in his reign 4438 did cast away 2186-52 in his transgression, 4604 have we prepared 3559-52 and sanctified, 6942-52 and, behold, they [are] before 6440 the altar 4196 of the LORD. 3068

29:20 Then Hezekiah 3169 the king 4428 rose early, 7925-55 and gathered 622-4 the rulers 8269 of the city, 5892 and went up 5927-4 to the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

29:21 And they brought 935-55 seven 7651 bullocks, 6499 and seven 7651 rams, 352 and seven 7651 lambs, 3532 and seven 7651 he 6842 goats, 5795 for a sin offering 2403 for the kingdom, 4467 and for the sanctuary, 4720 and for Judah. 3063 And he commanded 559-4 the priests 3548 the sons 1121 of Aaron 175 to offer 5927-53 [them] on the altar 4196 of the LORD. 3068

29:22 So they killed 7819-4 the bullocks, 1241 and the priests 3548 received 6901-17 the blood, 1818 and sprinkled 2236-4 [it] on the altar: 4196 likewise, when they had killed 7819-4 the rams, 352 they sprinkled 2236-4 the blood 1818 upon the altar: 4196 they killed 7819-4 also the lambs, 3532 and they sprinkled 2236-4 the blood 1818 upon the altar. 4196

29:23 And they brought forth 5066-55 the he goats 8163 [for] the sin offering 2403 before 6440 the king 4428 and the congregation; 6951 and they laid 5564-4 their hands 3027 upon them:

29:24 And the priests 3548 killed 7819-4 them, and they made reconciliation 2398-17 with their blood 1818 upon the altar, 4196 to make an atonement 3722-15 for all Israel: 3478 for the king 4428 commanded 559-1 [that] the burnt offering 5930 and the sin offering 2403 [should be made] for all Israel. 3478

29:25 And he set 5975-55 the Levites 3881 in the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 with cymbals, 4700 with psalteries, 5035 and with harps, 3658 according to the commandment 4687 of David, 1732 and of Gad 1410 the king's 4428 seer, 2374 and Nathan 5416 the prophet: 5030 for [so was] the commandment 4687 3027 of the LORD 3068 by 3027 his prophets. 5030

29:26 And the Levites 3881 stood 5975-4 with the instruments 3627 of David, 1732 and the priests 3548 with the trumpets. 2689

29:27 And Hezekiah 2396 commanded 559-4 to offer 5927-53 the burnt offering 5930 upon the altar. 4196 And when 6256 the burnt offering 5930 began, 2490-52 the song 7892 of the LORD 3068 began 2490-52 [also] with the trumpets, 2689 and with the 3027 instruments 3627 [ordained] by David 1732 king 4428 of Israel. 3478

29:28 And all the congregation 6951 worshipped, 7812-102 and the singers 7892 sang, 7891-35 and the trumpeters 2689 sounded: 2690-56|2690-18-k [and] all [this continued] until the burnt offering 5930 was finished. 3615-2

29:29 And when they had made an end 3615-15 of offering, 5927-53 the king 4428 and all that were present 4672-12 with him bowed 3766-1 themselves, and worshipped. 7812-101

29:30 Moreover Hezekiah 3169 the king 4428 and the princes 8269 commanded 559-4 the Levites 3881 to sing praise 1984-15 unto the LORD 3068 with the words 1697 of David, 1732 and of Asaph 623 the seer. 2374 And they sang praises 1984-17 with gladness, 8057 and they bowed their heads 6915-4 and worshipped. 7812-101

29:31 Then Hezekiah 3169 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 Now ye have consecrated 4390-14 yourselves 3027 unto the LORD, 3068 come near 5066-3 and bring 935-54 sacrifices 2077 and thank offerings 8426 into the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068 And the congregation 6951 brought in 935-55 sacrifices 2077 and thank offerings; 8426 and as many as were of a free 5081 heart 3820 burnt offerings. 5930

29:32 And the number 4557 of the burnt offerings, 5930 which the congregation 6951 brought, 935-52 was threescore and ten 7657 bullocks, 1241 an hundred 3967 rams, 352 [and] two hundred 3967 lambs: 3532 all these [were] for a burnt offering 5930 to the LORD. 3068

29:33 And the consecrated things 6944 [were] six 8337 hundred 3967 oxen 1241 and three 7969 thousand 505 sheep. 6629

29:34 But the priests 3548 were too few, 4592 so that they could 3201-1 not flay 6584-53 all the burnt offerings: 5930 wherefore their brethren 251 the Levites 3881 did help 2388-17 them, till the work 4399 was ended, 3615-2 and until the [other] priests 3548 had sanctified 6942-101 themselves: for the Levites 3881 [were] more upright 3477 in heart 3824 to sanctify 6942-99 themselves than the priests. 3548

29:35 And also the burnt offerings 5930 [were] in abundance, 7230 with the fat 2459 of the peace offerings, 8002 and the drink offerings 5262 for [every] burnt offering. 5930 So the service 5656 of the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 was set in order. 3559-11

29:36 And Hezekiah 3169 rejoiced, 8055-4 and all the people, 5971 that God 430 had prepared 3559-52 the people: 5971 for the thing 1697 was [done] suddenly. 6597

30:1 And Hezekiah 3169 sent 7971-4 to all Israel 3478 and Judah, 3063 and wrote 3789-1 letters 107 also to Ephraim 669 and Manasseh, 4519 that they should come 935-2 to the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 at Jerusalem, 3389 to keep 6213-2 the passover 6453 unto the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel. 3478

30:2 For the king 4428 had taken counsel, 3289-11 and his princes, 8269 and all the congregation 6951 in Jerusalem, 3389 to keep 6213-2 the passover 6453 in the second 8145 month. 2320

30:3 For they could 3201-1 not keep 6213-2 it at that time, 6256 because the priests 3548 had not sanctified 6942-98 themselves sufficiently, 4078|1767-q neither had the people 5971 gathered 622-8 themselves together to Jerusalem. 3389

30:4 And the thing 1697 pleased 3474-4 5869 the king 4428 and 5869 all the congregation. 6951

30:5 So they established 5975-55 a decree 1697 to make proclamation 5674-53 6963 throughout all Israel, 3478 from Beersheba 884 even to Dan, 1835 that they should come 935-2 to keep 6213-2 the passover 6453 unto the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 at Jerusalem: 3389 for they had not done 6213-1 [it] of a long 7230 [time in such sort] as it was written. 3789-7

30:6 So the posts 7323-5 went 3212-4 with the letters 107 from 3027 the king 4428 and his princes 8269 throughout all Israel 3478 and Judah, 3063 and according to the commandment 4687 of the king, 4428 saying, 559-2 Ye children 1121 of Israel, 3478 turn again 7725-3 unto the LORD 3068 God 430 of Abraham, 85 Isaac, 3327 and Israel, 3478 and he will return 7725-4 to the remnant 7604-12 of you, that are escaped 6413 out of the hand 3709 of the kings 4428 of Assyria. 804

30:7 And be not ye like your fathers, 1 and like your brethren, 251 which trespassed 4603-1 against the LORD 3068 God 430 of their fathers, 1 [who] therefore gave them up 5414-4 to desolation, 8047 as ye see. 7200-6

30:8 Now be ye not stiffnecked, 7185-55 6203 as your fathers 1 [were, but] yield 5414-3 yourselves 3027 unto the LORD, 3068 and enter 935-3 into his sanctuary, 4720 which he hath sanctified 6942-52 for ever: 5769 and serve 5647-3 the LORD 3068 your God, 430 that the fierceness 2740 of his wrath 639 may turn away 7725-4 from you.

30:9 For if ye turn again 7725-2 unto the LORD, 3068 your brethren 251 and your children 1121 [shall find] compassion 7356 before 6440 them that lead them captive, 7617-6 so that they shall come again 7725-2 into this land: 776 for the LORD 3068 your God 430 [is] gracious 2587 and merciful, 7349 and will not turn away 5493-55 [his] face 6440 from you, if ye return 7725-4 unto him.

30:10 So the posts 7323-5 passed 5674-6 from city 5892 to city 5892 through the country 776 of Ephraim 669 and Manasseh 4519 even unto Zebulun: 2074 but they laughed them to scorn, 7832-56 and mocked 3932-56 them.

30:11 Nevertheless divers 582 of Asher 836 and Manasseh 4519 and of Zebulun 2074 humbled 3665-8 themselves, and came 935-4 to Jerusalem. 3389

30:12 Also in Judah 3063 the hand 3027 of God 430 was to give 5414-2 them one 259 heart 3820 to do 6213-2 the commandment 4687 of the king 4428 and of the princes, 8269 by the word 1697 of the LORD. 3068

30:13 And there assembled 622-11 at Jerusalem 3389 much 7227 people 5971 to keep 6213-2 the feast 2282 of unleavened bread 4682 in the second 8145 month, 2320 a very 3966 great 7230 congregation. 6951

30:14 And they arose 6965-4 and took away 5493-55 the altars 4196 that [were] in Jerusalem, 3389 and all the altars for incense 6999 took they away, 5493-52 and cast 7993-55 [them] into the brook 5158 Kidron. 6939

30:15 Then they killed 7819-4 the passover 6453 on the fourteenth 702 6240 [day] of the second 8145 month: 2320 and the priests 3548 and the Levites 3881 were ashamed, 3637-8 and sanctified 6942-101 themselves, and brought in 935-55 the burnt offerings 5930 into the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

30:16 And they stood 5975-4 in their place 5977 after their manner, 4941 according to the law 8451 of Moses 4872 the man 376 of God: 430 the priests 3548 sprinkled 2236-6 the blood, 1818 [which they received] of the hand 3027 of the Levites. 3881

30:17 For [there were] many 7227 in the congregation 6951 that were not sanctified: 6942-98 therefore the Levites 3881 had the charge of the killing 7821 of the passovers 6453 for every one [that was] not clean, 2889 to sanctify 6942-53 [them] unto the LORD. 3068

30:18 For a multitude 4768 of the people, 5971 [even] many 7227 of Ephraim, 669 and Manasseh, 4519 Issachar, 3485 and Zebulun, 2074 had not 3808 cleansed 2891-98 themselves, yet did they eat 398-1 the passover 6453 otherwise 3808 than it was written. 3789-7 But Hezekiah 3169 prayed 6419-98 for them, saying, 559-2 The good 2896 LORD 3068 pardon 3722-17 every one

30:19 [That] prepareth 3559-52 his heart 3824 to seek 1875-2 God, 430 the LORD 3068 God 430 of his fathers, 1 though [he be] not [cleansed] according to the purification 2893 of the sanctuary. 6944

30:20 And the LORD 3068 hearkened 8085-4 to Hezekiah, 3169 and healed 7495-4 the people. 5971

30:21 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 that were present 4672-12 at Jerusalem 3389 kept 6213-4 the feast 2282 of unleavened bread 4682 seven 7651 days 3117 with great 1419 gladness: 8057 and the Levites 3881 and the priests 3548 praised 1984-18 the LORD 3068 day 3117 by day, 3117 [singing] with loud 5797 instruments 3627 unto the LORD. 3068

30:22 And Hezekiah 3169 spake 1696-17 comfortably 3820 unto all the Levites 3881 that taught 7919-56 the good 2896 knowledge 7922 of the LORD: 3068 and they did eat 398-4 throughout the feast 4150 seven 7651 days, 3117 offering 2076-18 peace 8002 offerings, 2077 and making confession 3034-102 to the LORD 3068 God 430 of their fathers. 1

30:23 And the whole assembly 6951 took counsel 3289-11 to keep 6213-2 other 312 seven 7651 days: 3117 and they kept 6213-4 [other] seven 7651 days 3117 with gladness. 8057

30:24 For Hezekiah 2396 king 4428 of Judah 3063 did give 7311-52 to the congregation 6951 a thousand 505 bullocks 6499 and seven 7651 thousand 505 sheep; 6629 and the princes 8269 gave 7311-52 to the congregation 6951 a thousand 505 bullocks 6499 and ten 6235 thousand 505 sheep: 6629 and a great number 7230 of priests 3548 sanctified 6942-101 themselves.

30:25 And all the congregation 6951 of Judah, 3063 with the priests 3548 and the Levites, 3881 and all the congregation 6951 that came 935-6 out of Israel, 3478 and the strangers 1616 that came 935-6 out of the land 776 of Israel, 3478 and that dwelt 3427-6 in Judah, 3063 rejoiced. 8055-4

30:26 So there was great 1419 joy 8057 in Jerusalem: 3389 for since the time 3117 of Solomon 8010 the son 1121 of David 1732 king 4428 of Israel 3478 [there was] not the like in Jerusalem. 3389

30:27 Then the priests 3548 the Levites 3881 arose 6965-4 and blessed 1288-17 the people: 5971 and their voice 6963 was heard, 8085-11 and their prayer 8605 came 935-4 [up] to his holy 6944 dwelling place, 4583 [even] unto heaven. 8064

31:1 Now when all this was finished, 3615-15 all Israel 3478 that were present 4672-12 went out 3318-1 to the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 and brake 7665-17 the images 4676 in pieces, and cut down 1438-17 the groves, 842 and threw down 5422-17 the high places 1116 and the altars 4196 out of all Judah 3063 and Benjamin, 1144 in Ephraim 669 also and Manasseh, 4519 until they had utterly destroyed 3615-15 them all. Then all the children 1121 of Israel 3478 returned, 7725-4 every man 376 to his possession, 272 into their own cities. 5892

31:2 And Hezekiah 3169 appointed 5975-55 the courses 4256 of the priests 3548 and the Levites 3881 after their courses, 4256 every man 376 according 6310 to his service, 5656 the priests 3548 and Levites 3881 for burnt offerings 5930 and for peace offerings, 8002 to minister, 8334-15 and to give thanks, 3034-53 and to praise 1984-15 in the gates 8179 of the tents 4264 of the LORD. 3068

31:3 [He appointed] also the king's 4428 portion 4521 of his substance 7399 for the burnt offerings, 5930 [to wit], for the morning 1242 and evening 6153 burnt offerings, 5930 and the burnt offerings 5930 for the sabbaths, 7676 and for the new moons, 2320 and for the set feasts, 4150 as [it is] written 3789-7 in the law 8451 of the LORD. 3068

31:4 Moreover he commanded 559-4 the people 5971 that dwelt 3427-6 in Jerusalem 3389 to give 5414-2 the portion 4521 of the priests 3548 and the Levites, 3881 that they might be encouraged 2388-4 in the law 8451 of the LORD. 3068

31:5 And as soon as the commandment 1697 came abroad, 6555-2 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 brought in abundance 7235-52 the firstfruits 7225 of corn, 1715 wine, 8492 and oil, 3323 and honey, 1706 and of all the increase 8393 of the field; 7704 and the tithe 4643 of all [things] brought 935-52 they in abundantly. 7230

31:6 And [concerning] the children 1121 of Israel 3478 and Judah, 3063 that dwelt 3427-6 in the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 they also brought in 935-52 the tithe 4643 of oxen 1241 and sheep, 6629 and the tithe 4643 of holy things 6944 which were consecrated 6942-30 unto the LORD 3068 their God, 430 and laid 5414-4 [them] by heaps. 6194 6194

31:7 In the third 7992 month 2320 they began 2490-52 to lay the foundation 3245-2 of the heaps, 6194 and finished 3615-14 [them] in the seventh 7637 month. 2320

31:8 And when Hezekiah 3169 and the princes 8269 came 935-4 and saw 7200-4 the heaps, 6194 they blessed 1288-17 the LORD, 3068 and his people 5971 Israel. 3478

31:9 Then Hezekiah 3169 questioned 1875-4 with the priests 3548 and the Levites 3881 concerning the heaps. 6194

31:10 And Azariah 5838 the chief 7218 priest 3548 of the house 1004 of Zadok 6659 answered 559-4 him, and said, 559-4 Since [the people] began 2490-53 to bring 935-53 the offerings 8641 into the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 we have had enough 7646-2 to eat, 398-2 and have left 3498-53 plenty: 7230 for the LORD 3068 hath blessed 1288-14 his people; 5971 and that which is left 3498-12 [is] this great store. 1995

31:11 Then Hezekiah 3169 commanded 559-4 to prepare 3559-53 chambers 3957 in the house 1004 of the LORD; 3068 and they prepared 3559-55 [them],

31:12 And brought in 935-55 the offerings 8641 and the tithes 4643 and the dedicated 6944 [things] faithfully: 530 over which Cononiah 3562 the Levite 3881 [was] ruler, 5057 and Shimei 8096 his brother 251 [was] the next. 4932

31:13 And Jehiel, 3171 and Azaziah, 5812 and Nahath, 5184 and Asahel, 6214 and Jerimoth, 3406 and Jozabad, 3107 and Eliel, 447 and Ismachiah, 3253 and Mahath, 4287 and Benaiah, 1141 [were] overseers 6496 under the hand 3027 of Cononiah 3562 and Shimei 8096 his brother, 251 at the commandment 4662 of Hezekiah 3169 the king, 4428 and Azariah 5838 the ruler 5057 of the house 1004 of God. 430

31:14 And Kore 6981 the son 1121 of Imnah 3232 the Levite, 3881 the porter 7778 toward the east, 4217 [was] over the freewill offerings 5071 of God, 430 to distribute 5414-2 the oblations 8641 of the LORD, 3068 and the most 6944 holy things. 6944

31:15 And next him 3027 [were] Eden, 5731 and Miniamin, 4509 and Jeshua, 3442 and Shemaiah, 8098 Amariah, 568 and Shecaniah, 7935 in the cities 5892 of the priests, 3548 in [their] set office, 530 to give 5414-2 to their brethren 251 by courses, 4256 as well to the great 1419 as to the small: 6996

31:16 Beside their genealogy 3187-99 of males, 2145 from three 7969 years 8141 old 1121 and upward, 4605 [even] unto every one that entereth 935-6 into the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 his daily 3117 3117 portion 1697 for their service 5656 in their charges 4931 according to their courses; 4256

31:17 Both to the genealogy 3187-99 of the priests 3548 by the house 1004 of their fathers, 1 and the Levites 3881 from twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 and upward, 4605 in their charges 4931 by their courses; 4256

31:18 And to the genealogy 3187-99 of all their little ones, 2945 their wives, 802 and their sons, 1121 and their daughters, 1323 through all the congregation: 6951 for in their set office 530 they sanctified 6942-101 themselves in holiness: 6944

31:19 Also of the sons 1121 of Aaron 175 the priests, 3548 [which were] in the fields 7704 of the suburbs 4054 of their cities, 5892 in every several city, 5892 5892 the men 582 that were expressed 5344-8 by name, 8034 to give 5414-2 portions 4490 to all the males 2145 among the priests, 3548 and to all that were reckoned by genealogies 3187-99 among the Levites. 3881

31:20 And thus did 6213-4 Hezekiah 3169 throughout all Judah, 3063 and wrought 6213-4 [that which was] good 2896 and right 3477 and truth 571 before 6440 the LORD 3068 his God. 430

31:21 And in every work 4639 that he began 2490-52 in the service 5656 of the house 1004 of God, 430 and in the law, 8451 and in the commandments, 4687 to seek 1875-2 his God, 430 he did 6213-1 [it] with all his heart, 3824 and prospered. 6743-52

32:1 After 310 these things, 1697 and the establishment 571 thereof, Sennacherib 5576 king 4428 of Assyria 804 came, 935-1 and entered 935-4 into Judah, 3063 and encamped 2583-4 against the fenced 1219-7 cities, 5892 and thought 559-4 to win 1234-2 them for himself.

32:2 And when Hezekiah 3169 saw 7200-4 that Sennacherib 5576 was come, 935-1 and that he was purposed 6440 to fight 4421 against Jerusalem, 3389

32:3 He took counsel 3289-11 with his princes 8269 and his mighty men 1368 to stop 5640-2 the waters 4325 of the fountains 5869 which [were] without 2351 the city: 5892 and they did help 5826-4 him.

32:4 So there was gathered much 7227 people 5971 together, 6908-11 who stopped 5640-4 all the fountains, 4599 and the brook 5158 that ran 7857-6 through the midst 8432 of the land, 776 saying, 559-2 Why should the kings 4428 of Assyria 804 come, 935-4 and find 4672-1 much 7227 water? 4325

32:5 Also he strengthened 2388-101 himself, and built up 1129-4 all the wall 2346 that was broken, 6555-7 and raised [it] up 5927-55 to the towers, 4026 and another 312 wall 2346 without, 2351 and repaired 2388-17 Millo 4407 [in] the city 5892 of David, 1732 and made 6213-4 darts 7973 and shields 4043 in abundance. 7230

32:6 And he set 5414-4 captains 8269 of war 4421 over the people, 5971 and gathered them together 6908-4 to him in the street 7339 of the gate 8179 of the city, 5892 and spake 1696-17 comfortably 3824 to them, saying, 559-2

32:7 Be strong 2388-3 and courageous, 553-3 be not afraid 3372-4 nor dismayed 2865-11 for 6440 the king 4428 of Assyria, 804 nor for 6440 all the multitude 1995 that [is] with him: for [there be] more 7227 with us than with him:

32:8 With him [is] an arm 2220 of flesh; 1320 but with us [is] the LORD 3068 our God 430 to help 5826-2 us, and to fight 3898-9 our battles. 4421 And the people 5971 rested 5564-11 themselves upon the words 1697 of Hezekiah 3169 king 4428 of Judah. 3063

32:9 After 310 this did Sennacherib 5576 king 4428 of Assyria 804 send 7971-1 his servants 5650 to Jerusalem, 3389 (but he [himself laid siege] against Lachish, 3923 and all his power 4475 with him,) unto Hezekiah 3169 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 and unto all Judah 3063 that [were] at Jerusalem, 3389 saying, 559-2

32:10 Thus saith 559-1 Sennacherib 5576 king 4428 of Assyria, 804 Whereon do ye trust, 982-6 that ye abide 3427-6 in the siege 4692 in Jerusalem? 3389

32:11 Doth not Hezekiah 3169 persuade 5496-56 you to give 5414-2 over yourselves to die 4191-2 by famine 7458 and by thirst, 6772 saying, 559-2 The LORD 3068 our God 430 shall deliver 5337-55 us out of the hand 3709 of the king 4428 of Assyria? 804

32:12 Hath not the same Hezekiah 3169 taken away 5493-52 his high places 1116 and his altars, 4196 and commanded 559-4 Judah 3063 and Jerusalem, 3389 saying, 559-2 Ye shall worship 7812-101 before 6440 one 259 altar, 4196 and burn incense 6999-55 upon it?

32:13 Know 3045-4 ye not what I and my fathers 1 have done 6213-1 unto all the people 5971 of [other] lands? 776 were the gods 430 of the nations 1471 of those lands 776 any ways 3201-2 able 3201-1 to deliver 5337-53 their lands 776 out of mine hand? 3027

32:14 Who [was there] among all the gods 430 of those nations 1471 that my fathers 1 utterly destroyed, 2763-52 that could 3201-1 deliver 5337-53 his people 5971 out of mine hand, 3027 that your God 430 should be able 3201-4 to deliver 5337-53 you out of mine hand? 3027

32:15 Now therefore let not 408 Hezekiah 2396 deceive 5377-55 you, nor 408 persuade 5496-55 you on this manner, neither 408 yet believe 539-55 him: for no 3808 god 433 of any nation 1471 or kingdom 4467 was able 3201-4 to deliver 5337-53 his people 5971 out of mine hand, 3027 and out of the hand 3027 of my fathers: 1 how much less 3808 shall your God 430 deliver 5337-55 you out of mine hand? 3027

32:16 And his servants 5650 spake 1696-14 yet [more] against the LORD 3068 God, 430 and against his servant 5650 Hezekiah. 3169

32:17 He wrote 3789-1 also letters 5612 to rail 2778-15 on the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 and to speak 559-2 against him, saying, 559-2 As the gods 430 of the nations 1471 of [other] lands 776 have not delivered 5337-52 their people 5971 out of mine hand, 3027 so shall not the God 430 of Hezekiah 3169 deliver 5337-55 his people 5971 out of mine hand. 3027

32:18 Then they cried 7121-4 with a loud 1419 voice 6963 in the Jews' speech 3066 unto the people 5971 of Jerusalem 3389 that [were] on the wall, 2346 to affright 3372-15 them, and to trouble 926-15 them; that they might take 3920-4 the city. 5892

32:19 And they spake 1696-17 against the God 430 of Jerusalem, 3389 as against 5921 the gods 430 of the people 5971 of the earth, 776 [which were] the work 4639 of the hands 3027 of man. 120

32:20 And for this [cause] Hezekiah 3169 the king, 4428 and the prophet 5030 Isaiah 3470 the son 1121 of Amoz, 531 prayed 6419-101 and cried 2199-4 to heaven. 8064

32:21 And the LORD 3068 sent 7971-4 an angel, 4397 which cut off 3582-55 all the mighty men 1368 of valour, 2428 and the leaders 5057 and captains 8269 in the camp 4264 of the king 4428 of Assyria. 804 So he returned 7725-4 with shame 1322 of face 6440 to his own land. 776 And when he was come 935-4 into the house 1004 of his god, 430 they that came forth 3329 of his own bowels 4578 slew 5307-52 him there with the sword. 2719

32:22 Thus the LORD 3068 saved 3467-55 Hezekiah 3169 and the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem 3389 from the hand 3027 of Sennacherib 5576 the king 4428 of Assyria, 804 and from the hand 3027 of all [other], and guided 5095-17 them on every side. 5439

32:23 And many 7227 brought 935-56 gifts 4503 unto the LORD 3068 to Jerusalem, 3389 and presents 4030 to Hezekiah 3169 king 4428 of Judah: 3063 so that he was magnified 5375-11 in the sight 5869 of all nations 1471 from thenceforth. 310

32:24 In those days 3117 Hezekiah 3169 was sick 2470-1 to the death, 4191-2 and prayed 6419-101 unto the LORD: 3068 and he spake 559-4 unto him, and he gave 5414-1 him a sign. 4159

32:25 But Hezekiah 3169 rendered not again 7725-52 according to the benefit 1576 [done] unto him; for his heart 3820 was lifted up: 1361-1 therefore there was wrath 7110 upon him, and upon Judah 3063 and Jerusalem. 3389

32:26 Notwithstanding Hezekiah 3169 humbled 3665-11 himself for the pride 1363 of his heart, 3820 [both] he and the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem, 3389 so that the wrath 7110 of the LORD 3068 came 935-1 not upon them in the days 3117 of Hezekiah. 3169

32:27 And Hezekiah 3169 had exceeding 3966 much 7235-53 riches 6239 and honour: 3519 and he made 6213-1 himself treasuries 214 for silver, 3701 and for gold, 2091 and for precious 3368 stones, 68 and for spices, 1314 and for shields, 4043 and for all manner of pleasant 2532 jewels; 3627

32:28 Storehouses 4543 also for the increase 8393 of corn, 1715 and wine, 8492 and oil; 3323 and stalls 723 for all manner of beasts, 929 929 and cotes 220 for flocks. 5739

32:29 Moreover he provided 6213-1 him cities, 5892 and possessions 4735 of flocks 6629 and herds 1241 in abundance: 7230 for God 430 had given 5414-1 him substance 7399 very 3966 much. 7227

32:30 This same Hezekiah 3169 also stopped 5640-1 the upper 5945 watercourse 4161 4325 of Gihon, 1521 and brought it straight 3474-17 down 4295 to the west side 4628 of the city 5892 of David. 1732 And Hezekiah 3169 prospered 6743-55 in all his works. 4639

32:31 Howbeit 3651 in [the business of] the ambassadors 3887-56 of the princes 8269 of Babylon, 894 who sent 7971-18 unto him to enquire 1875-2 of the wonder 4159 that was [done] in the land, 776 God 430 left 5800-1 him, to try 5254-15 him, that he might know 3045-2 all [that was] in his heart. 3824

32:32 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Hezekiah, 3169 and his goodness, 2617 behold, they [are] written 3789-7 in the vision 2377 of Isaiah 3470 the prophet, 5030 the son 1121 of Amoz, 531 [and] in the book 5612 of the kings 4428 of Judah 3063 and Israel. 3478

32:33 And Hezekiah 3169 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and they buried 6912-4 him in the chiefest 4608 of the sepulchres 6913 of the sons 1121 of David: 1732 and all Judah 3063 and the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem 3389 did 6213-1 him honour 3519 at his death. 4194 And Manasseh 4519 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

33:1 Manasseh 4519 [was] twelve 8147 6240 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 fifty 2572 and five 2568 years 8141 in Jerusalem: 3389

33:2 But did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 like unto the abominations 8441 of the heathen, 1471 whom the LORD 3068 had cast out 3423-52 before 6440 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

33:3 For he built 1129-4 again 7725-4 the high places 1116 which Hezekiah 3169 his father 1 had broken down, 5422-14 and he reared up 6965-55 altars 4196 for Baalim, 1168 and made 6213-4 groves, 842 and worshipped 7812-101 all the host 6635 of heaven, 8064 and served 5647-4 them.

33:4 Also he built 1129-1 altars 4196 in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 whereof the LORD 3068 had said, 559-1 In Jerusalem 3389 shall my name 8034 be for ever. 5769

33:5 And he built 1129-4 altars 4196 for all the host 6635 of heaven 8064 in the two 8147 courts 2691 of the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

33:6 And he caused his children 1121 to pass 5674-52 through the fire 784 in the valley 1516 of the son 1121 of Hinnom: 2011 also he observed times, 6049-22 and used enchantments, 5172-14 and used witchcraft, 3784-14 and dealt 6213-1 with a familiar spirit, 178 and with wizards: 3049 he wrought 6213-2 much 7235-52 evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 to provoke him to anger. 3707-53

33:7 And he set 7760-4 a carved image, 6459 the idol 5566 which he had made, 6213-1 in the house 1004 of God, 430 of which God 430 had said 559-1 to David 1732 and to Solomon 8010 his son, 1121 In this house, 1004 and in Jerusalem, 3389 which I have chosen 977-1 before all the tribes 7626 of Israel, 3478 will I put 7760-4 my name 8034 for ever: 5865

33:8 Neither will I any more 3254-55 remove 5493-53 the foot 7272 of Israel 3478 from out 5921 of the land 127 which I have appointed 5975-52 for your fathers; 1 so that 518 they will take heed 8104-4 to do 6213-2 all that I have commanded 6680-14 them, according to the whole law 8451 and the statutes 2706 and the ordinances 4941 by the hand 3027 of Moses. 4872

33:9 So Manasseh 4519 made Judah 3063 and the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem 3389 to err, 8582-55 [and] to do 6213-2 worse 7451 than the heathen, 1471 whom the LORD 3068 had destroyed 8045-52 before 6440 the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

33:10 And the LORD 3068 spake 1696-17 to Manasseh, 4519 and to his people: 5971 but they would not hearken. 7181-52

33:11 Wherefore the LORD 3068 brought 935-55 upon them the captains 8269 of the host of 6635 the king 4428 of Assyria, 804 which took 3920-4 Manasseh 4519 among the thorns, 2336 and bound 631-4 him with fetters, 5178 and carried 3212-55 him to Babylon. 894

33:12 And when he was in affliction, 6887-53 he besought 2470-14 6440 the LORD 3068 his God, 430 and humbled 3665-11 himself greatly 3966 before 6440 the God 430 of his fathers, 1

33:13 And prayed 6419-101 unto him: and he was intreated 6279-11 of him, and heard 8085-4 his supplication, 8467 and brought him again 7725-55 to Jerusalem 3389 into his kingdom. 4438 Then Manasseh 4519 knew 3045-4 that the LORD 3068 he [was] God. 430

33:14 Now after 310 this he built 1129-1 a wall 2346 without 2435 the city 5892 of David, 1732 on the west side 4628 of Gihon, 1521 in the valley, 5158 even to the entering in 935-2 at the fish 1709 gate, 8179 and compassed 5437-1 about Ophel, 6077|6076 and raised it up a very 3966 great height, 1361-55 and put 7760-4 captains 8269 of war 2428 in all the fenced 1219-7 cities 5892 of Judah. 3063

33:15 And he took away 5493-55 the strange 5236 gods, 430 and the idol 5566 out of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and all the altars 4196 that he had built 1129-1 in the mount 2022 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and in Jerusalem, 3389 and cast 7993-55 [them] out 2351 of the city. 5892

33:16 And he repaired 1129-4 the altar 4196 of the LORD, 3068 and sacrificed 2076-4 thereon peace 8002 offerings 2077 and thank offerings, 8426 and commanded 559-4 Judah 3063 to serve 5647-2 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel. 3478

33:17 Nevertheless 61 the people 5971 did sacrifice 2076-6 still in the high places, 1116 [yet] unto the LORD 3068 their God 430 only.

33:18 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Manasseh, 4519 and his prayer 8605 unto his God, 430 and the words 1697 of the seers 2374 that spake 1696-18 to him in the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 behold, they [are written] in the book 1697 of the kings 4428 of Israel. 3478

33:19 His prayer 8605 also, and [how God] was intreated 6279-9 of him, and all his sin, 2403 and his trespass, 4604 and the places 4725 wherein he built 1129-1 high places, 1116 and set up 5975-52 groves 842 and graven images, 6456 before 6440 he was humbled: 3665-9 behold, they [are] written 3789-7 among the sayings 1697 of the seers. 2374|2335-q

33:20 So Manasseh 4519 slept 7901-4 with his fathers, 1 and they buried 6912-4 him in his own house: 1004 and Amon 526 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

33:21 Amon 526 [was] two 8147 and twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and reigned 4427-1 two 8147 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389

33:22 But he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 as did 6213-1 Manasseh 4519 his father: 1 for Amon 526 sacrificed 2076-14 unto all the carved images 6456 which Manasseh 4519 his father 1 had made, 6213-1 and served 5647-4 them;

33:23 And humbled 3665-8 not himself before 6440 the LORD, 3068 as Manasseh 4519 his father 1 had humbled 3665-9 himself; but Amon 526 trespassed 819 more and more. 7235-52

33:24 And his servants 5650 conspired 7194-4 against him, and slew 4191-55 him in his own house. 1004

33:25 But the people 5971 of the land 776 slew 5221-55 all them that had conspired 7194-6 against king 4428 Amon; 526 and the people 5971 of the land 776 made Josiah 2977 his son 1121 king 4427-55 in his stead.

34:1 Josiah 2977 [was] eight 8083 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 in Jerusalem 3389 one 259 and thirty 7970 years. 8141

34:2 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] right 3477 in the sight 5869 of the LORD, 3068 and walked 3212-4 in the ways 1870 of David 1732 his father, 1 and declined 5493-1 [neither] to the right hand, 3225 nor to the left. 8040

34:3 For in the eighth 8083 year 8141 of his reign, 4427-2 while he was yet young, 5288 he began 2490-52 to seek 1875-2 after the God 430 of David 1732 his father: 1 and in the twelfth 8147 6240 year 8141 he began 2490-52 to purge 2891-15 Judah 3063 and Jerusalem 3389 from the high places, 1116 and the groves, 842 and the carved images, 6456 and the molten images. 4541

34:4 And they brake down 5422-17 the altars 4196 of Baalim 1168 in his presence; 6440 and the images, 2553 that [were] on high above them, 4605 he cut down; 1438-14 and the groves, 842 and the carved images, 6456 and the molten images, 4541 he brake in pieces, 7665-14 and made dust 1854-52 [of them], and strowed 2236-4 [it] upon 6440 the graves 6913 of them that had sacrificed 2076-6 unto them.

34:5 And he burnt 8313-1 the bones 6106 of the priests 3548 upon their altars, 4196 and cleansed 2891-17 Judah 3063 and Jerusalem. 3389

34:6 And [so did he] in the cities 5892 of Manasseh, 4519 and Ephraim, 669 and Simeon, 8095 even unto Naphtali, 5321 with their mattocks 2719 round about. 5439

34:7 And when he had broken down 5422-17 the altars 4196 and the groves, 842 and had beaten 3807-14 the graven images 6456 into powder, 1854-53 and cut down 1438-14 all the idols 2553 throughout all the land 776 of Israel, 3478 he returned 7725-4 to Jerusalem. 3389

34:8 Now in the eighteenth 8083 6240 year 8141 of his reign, 4427-2 when he had purged 2891-15 the land, 776 and the house, 1004 he sent 7971-1 Shaphan 8227 the son 1121 of Azaliah, 683 and Maaseiah 4641 the governor 8269 of the city, 5892 and Joah 3098 the son 1121 of Joahaz 3099 the recorder, 2142-56 to repair 2388-15 the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 his God. 430

34:9 And when they came 935-4 to Hilkiah 2518 the high 1419 priest, 3548 they delivered 5414-4 the money 3701 that was brought into 935-94 the house 1004 of God, 430 which the Levites 3881 that kept 8104-6 the doors 5592 had gathered 622-1 of the hand 3027 of Manasseh 4519 and Ephraim, 669 and of all the remnant 7611 of Israel, 3478 and of all Judah 3063 and Benjamin; 1144 and they returned 7725-4|3427-6-k to Jerusalem. 3389

34:10 And they put 5414-4 [it] in the hand 3027 of the workmen 6213-6 4399 that had the oversight 6485-94 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and they gave 5414-4 it to the workmen 6213-6 4399 that wrought 6213-6 in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 to repair 918-2 and amend 2388-15 the house: 1004

34:11 Even to the artificers 2796 and builders 1129-6 gave 5414-4 they [it], to buy 7069-2 hewn 4274 stone, 68 and timber 6086 for couplings, 4226 and to floor 7136-15 the houses 1004 which the kings 4428 of Judah 3063 had destroyed. 7843-52

34:12 And the men 582 did 6213-6 the work 4399 faithfully: 530 and the overseers 6485-94 of them [were] Jahath 3189 and Obadiah, 5662 the Levites, 3881 of the sons 1121 of Merari; 4847 and Zechariah 2148 and Meshullam, 4918 of the sons 1121 of the Kohathites, 6956 to set [it] forward; 5329-15 and [other of] the Levites, 3881 all that could skill 995-56 of instruments 3627 of musick. 7892

34:13 Also [they were] over the bearers of burdens, 5449 and [were] overseers 5329-18 of all that wrought 6213-6 the work 4399 in any manner of service: 5656 5656 and of the Levites 3881 [there were] scribes, 5608-6 and officers, 7860-6 and porters. 7778

34:14 And when they brought out 3318-53 the money 3701 that was brought into 935-94 the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 Hilkiah 2518 the priest 3548 found 4672-1 a book 5612 of the law 8451 of the LORD 3068 [given] by 3027 Moses. 4872

34:15 And Hilkiah 2518 answered 6030-4 and said 559-4 to Shaphan 8227 the scribe, 5608-6 I have found 4672-1 the book 5612 of the law 8451 in the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068 And Hilkiah 2518 delivered 5414-4 the book 5612 to Shaphan. 8227

34:16 And Shaphan 8227 carried 935-55 the book 5612 to the king, 4428 and brought the king 4428 word 1697 back again, 7725-55 saying, 559-2 All that was committed 5414-8 to 3027 thy servants, 5650 they do 6213-6 [it].

34:17 And they have gathered together 5413-55 the money 3701 that was found 4672-12 in the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and have delivered 5414-4 it into the hand 3027 of the overseers, 6485-94 and to the hand 3027 of the workmen. 6213-6 4399

34:18 Then Shaphan 8227 the scribe 5608-6 told 5046-55 the king, 4428 saying, 559-2 Hilkiah 2518 the priest 3548 hath given 5414-1 me a book. 5612 And Shaphan 8227 read 7121-4 it before 6440 the king. 4428

34:19 And it came to pass, when the king 4428 had heard 8085-2 the words 1697 of the law, 8451 that he rent 7167-4 his clothes. 899

34:20 And the king 4428 commanded 6680-17 Hilkiah, 2518 and Ahikam 296 the son 1121 of Shaphan, 8227 and Abdon 5658 the son 1121 of Micah, 4318 and Shaphan 8227 the scribe, 5608-6 and Asaiah 6222 a servant 5650 of the king's, 4428 saying, 559-2

34:21 Go, 3212-3 enquire 1875-3 of the LORD 3068 for me, and for them that are left 7604-12 in Israel 3478 and in Judah, 3063 concerning the words 1697 of the book 5612 that is found: 4672-8 for great 1419 [is] the wrath 2534 of the LORD 3068 that is poured out 5413-8 upon us, because our fathers 1 have not kept 8104-1 the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 to do 6213-2 after all that is written 3789-7 in this book. 5612

34:22 And Hilkiah, 2518 and [they] that the king 4428 [had appointed], went 3212-4 to Huldah 2468 the prophetess, 5031 the wife 802 of Shallum 7967 the son 1121 of Tikvath, 8616|8445-q the son 1121 of Hasrah, 2641 keeper 8104-6 of the wardrobe; 899 (now she dwelt 3427-6 in Jerusalem 3389 in the college:) 4932 and they spake 1696-17 to her to that [effect].

34:23 And she answered 559-4 them, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 Tell 559-3 ye the man 376 that sent 7971-1 you to me,

34:24 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Behold, I will bring 935-56 evil 7451 upon this place, 4725 and upon the inhabitants 3427-6 thereof, [even] all the curses 423 that are written 3789-7 in the book 5612 which they have read 7121-1 before 6440 the king 4428 of Judah: 3063

34:25 Because they have forsaken 5800-1 me, and have burned incense 6999-17|6999-55-k unto other 312 gods, 430 that they might provoke me to anger 3707-53 with all the works 4639 of their hands; 3027 therefore my wrath 2534 shall be poured out 5413-4 upon this place, 4725 and shall not be quenched. 3518-4

34:26 And as for 413 the king 4428 of Judah, 3063 who sent 7971-6 you to enquire 1875-2 of the LORD, 3068 so shall ye say 559-4 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 [concerning] the words 1697 which thou hast heard; 8085-1

34:27 Because thine heart 3824 was tender, 7401-1 and thou didst humble 3665-11 thyself before 6440 God, 430 when thou heardest 8085-2 his words 1697 against this place, 4725 and against the inhabitants 3427-6 thereof, and humbledst 3665-11 thyself before 6440 me, and didst rend 7167-4 thy clothes, 899 and weep 1058-4 before 6440 me; I have even heard 8085-1 [thee] also, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

34:28 Behold, I will gather 622-6 thee to thy fathers, 1 and thou shalt be gathered 622-8 to thy grave 6913 in peace, 7965 neither shall thine eyes 5869 see 7200-4 all the evil 7451 that I will bring 935-56 upon this place, 4725 and upon the inhabitants 3427-6 of the same. So they brought the king 4428 word 1697 again. 7725-55

34:29 Then the king 4428 sent 7971-4 and gathered 622-4 together all the elders 2205 of Judah 3063 and Jerusalem. 3389

34:30 And the king 4428 went up 5927-4 into the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and all the men 376 of Judah, 3063 and the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem, 3389 and the priests, 3548 and the Levites, 3881 and all the people, 5971 great 1419 and small: 6996 and he read 7121-4 in their ears 241 all the words 1697 of the book 5612 of the covenant 1285 that was found 4672-12 in the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

34:31 And the king 4428 stood 5975-4 in his place, 5977 and made 3772-4 a covenant 1285 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 to walk 3212-2 after 310 the LORD, 3068 and to keep 8104-2 his commandments, 4687 and his testimonies, 5715 and his statutes, 2706 with all his heart, 3824 and with all his soul, 5315 to perform 6213-2 the words 1697 of the covenant 1285 which are written 3789-7 in this book. 5612

34:32 And he caused all that were present 4672-12 in Jerusalem 3389 and Benjamin 1144 to stand 5975-55 [to it]. And the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem 3389 did 6213-4 according to the covenant 1285 of God, 430 the God 430 of their fathers. 1

34:33 And Josiah 2977 took away 5493-55 all the abominations 8441 out of all the countries 776 that [pertained] to the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and made all that were present 4672-12 in Israel 3478 to serve, 5647-55 [even] to serve 5647-2 the LORD 3068 their God. 430 [And] all his days 3117 they departed 5493-1 not from following 310 the LORD, 3068 the God 430 of their fathers. 1

35:1 Moreover Josiah 2977 kept 6213-4 a passover 6453 unto the LORD 3068 in Jerusalem: 3389 and they killed 7819-4 the passover 6453 on the fourteenth 702 6240 [day] of the first 7223 month. 2320

35:2 And he set 5975-55 the priests 3548 in their charges, 4931 and encouraged 2388-17 them to the service 5656 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068

35:3 And said 559-4 unto the Levites 3881 that taught 995-56|4000-k all Israel, 3478 which were holy 6918 unto the LORD, 3068 Put 5414-3 the holy 6944 ark 727 in the house 1004 which Solomon 8010 the son 1121 of David 1732 king 4428 of Israel 3478 did build; 1129-1 [it shall] not [be] a burden 4853 upon [your] shoulders: 3802 serve 5647-3 now the LORD 3068 your God, 430 and his people 5971 Israel, 3478

35:4 And prepare 3559-54|3559-10-k [yourselves] by the houses 1004 of your fathers, 1 after your courses, 4256 according to the writing 3791 of David 1732 king 4428 of Israel, 3478 and according to the writing 4385 of Solomon 8010 his son. 1121

35:5 And stand 5975-3 in the holy 6944 [place] according to the divisions 6391 of the families 1004 of the fathers 1 of your brethren 251 the people, 1121 5971 and [after] the division 2515 of the families 1 1004 of the Levites. 3881

35:6 So kill 7819-3 the passover, 6453 and sanctify 6942-100 yourselves, and prepare 3559-54 your brethren, 251 that [they] may do 6213-2 according to the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 by the hand 3027 of Moses. 4872

35:7 And Josiah 2977 gave 7311-55 to the people, 1121 5971 of the flock, 6629 lambs 3532 and kids, 1121 5795 all for the passover offerings, 6453 for all that were present, 4672-12 to the number 4557 of thirty 7970 thousand, 505 and three 7969 thousand 505 bullocks: 1241 these [were] of the king's 4428 substance. 7399

35:8 And his princes 8269 gave 7311-52 willingly 5071 unto the people, 5971 to the priests, 3548 and to the Levites: 3881 Hilkiah 2518 and Zechariah 2148 and Jehiel, 3171 rulers 5057 of the house 1004 of God, 430 gave 5414-1 unto the priests 3548 for the passover offerings 6453 two thousand 505 and six 8337 hundred 3967 [small cattle], and three 7969 hundred 3967 oxen. 1241

35:9 Conaniah 3562 also, and Shemaiah 8098 and Nethaneel, 5417 his brethren, 251 and Hashabiah 2811 and Jeiel 3273 and Jozabad, 3107 chief 8269 of the Levites, 3881 gave 7311-52 unto the Levites 3881 for passover offerings 6453 five 2568 thousand 505 [small cattle], and five 2568 hundred 3967 oxen. 1241

35:10 So the service 5656 was prepared, 3559-11 and the priests 3548 stood 5975-4 in their place, 5977 and the Levites 3881 in their courses, 4256 according to the king's 4428 commandment. 4687

35:11 And they killed 7819-4 the passover, 6453 and the priests 3548 sprinkled 2236-4 [the blood] from their hands, 3027 and the Levites 3881 flayed 6584-56 [them].

35:12 And they removed 5493-55 the burnt offerings, 5930 that they might give 5414-2 according to the divisions 4653 of the families 1 1004 of the people, 1121 5971 to offer 7126-53 unto the LORD, 3068 as [it is] written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of Moses. 4872 And so [did they] with the oxen. 1241

35:13 And they roasted 1310-17 the passover 6453 with fire 784 according to the ordinance: 4941 but the [other] holy 6944 [offerings] sod 1310-14 they in pots, 5518 and in caldrons, 1731 and in pans, 6745 and divided [them] speedily 7323-55 among all the people. 1121 5971

35:14 And afterward 310 they made ready 3559-52 for themselves, and for the priests: 3548 because the priests 3548 the sons 1121 of Aaron 175 [were busied] in offering 5927-53 of burnt offerings 5930 and the fat 2459 until night; 3915 therefore the Levites 3881 prepared 3559-52 for themselves, and for the priests 3548 the sons 1121 of Aaron. 175

35:15 And the singers 7891-35 the sons 1121 of Asaph 623 [were] in their place, 4612 according to the commandment 4687 of David, 1732 and Asaph, 623 and Heman, 1968 and Jeduthun 3038 the king's 4428 seer; 2374 and the porters 7778 [waited] at every gate; 8179 8179 they might not depart 5493-2 from their service; 5656 for their brethren 251 the Levites 3881 prepared 3559-52 for them.

35:16 So all the service 5656 of the LORD 3068 was prepared 3559-11 the same day, 3117 to keep 6213-2 the passover, 6453 and to offer 5927-53 burnt offerings 5930 upon the altar 4196 of the LORD, 3068 according to the commandment 4687 of king 4428 Josiah. 2977

35:17 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 that were present 4672-12 kept 6213-4 the passover 6453 at that time, 6256 and the feast 2282 of unleavened bread 4682 seven 7651 days. 3117

35:18 And there was no passover 6453 like 3644 to that kept 6213-8 in Israel 3478 from the days 3117 of Samuel 8050 the prophet; 5030 neither did 6213-1 all the kings 4428 of Israel 3478 keep 6213-1 such a passover 6453 as Josiah 2977 kept, 6213-1 and the priests, 3548 and the Levites, 3881 and all Judah 3063 and Israel 3478 that were present, 4672-12 and the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem. 3389

35:19 In the eighteenth 8083 6240 year 8141 of the reign 4438 of Josiah 2977 was this passover 6453 kept. 6213-8

35:20 After 310 all this, when Josiah 2977 had prepared 3559-52 the temple, 1004 Necho 5224 king 4428 of Egypt 4714 came up 5927-1 to fight 3898-9 against Carchemish 3751 by Euphrates: 6578 and Josiah 2977 went out 3318-4 against 7125-2 him.

35:21 But he sent 7971-4 ambassadors 4397 to him, saying, 559-2 What have I to do with thee, thou king 4428 of Judah? 3063 [I come] not against thee this day, 3117 but against the house 1004 wherewith I have war: 4421 for God 430 commanded 559-1 me to make haste: 926-15 forbear 2308-3 thee from [meddling with] God, 430 who [is] with me, that he destroy 7843-55 thee not.

35:22 Nevertheless Josiah 2977 would not turn 5437-52 his face 6440 from him, but disguised 2664-98 himself, that he might fight 3898-9 with him, and hearkened 8085-1 not unto the words 1697 of Necho 5224 from the mouth 6310 of God, 430 and came 935-4 to fight 3898-9 in the valley 1237 of Megiddo. 4023

35:23 And the archers 3384-6 shot 3384-55 at king 4428 Josiah; 2977 and the king 4428 said 559-4 to his servants, 5650 Have me away; 5674-54 for I am sore 3966 wounded. 2470-90

35:24 His servants 5650 therefore took 5674-55 him out of that chariot, 4818 and put 7392-55 him in the second 4932 chariot 7393 that he had; and they brought 3212-55 him to Jerusalem, 3389 and he died, 4191-4 and was buried 6912-11 in [one of] the sepulchres 6913 of his fathers. 1 And all Judah 3063 and Jerusalem 3389 mourned 56-102 for Josiah. 2977

35:25 And Jeremiah 3414 lamented 6969-34 for Josiah: 2977 and all the singing 7891-6 men and the singing 7891-6 women spake 559-4 of Josiah 2977 in their lamentations 7015 to this day, 3117 and made 5414-4 them an ordinance 2706 in Israel: 3478 and, behold, they [are] written 3789-7 in the lamentations. 7015

35:26 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Josiah, 2977 and his goodness, 2617 according to [that which was] written 3789-7 in the law 8451 of the LORD, 3068

35:27 And his deeds, 1697 first 7223 and last, 314 behold, they [are] written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the kings 4428 of Israel 3478 and Judah. 3063

36:1 Then the people 5971 of the land 776 took 3947-4 Jehoahaz 3059 the son 1121 of Josiah, 2977 and made him king 4427-55 in his father's 1 stead in Jerusalem. 3389

36:2 Jehoahaz 3099 [was] twenty 6242 and three 7969 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 three 7969 months 2320 in Jerusalem. 3389

36:3 And the king 4428 of Egypt 4714 put him down 5493-55 at Jerusalem, 3389 and condemned 6064-4 the land 776 in an hundred 3967 talents 3603 of silver 3701 and a talent 3603 of gold. 2091

36:4 And the king 4428 of Egypt 4714 made Eliakim 471 his brother 251 king 4427-55 over Judah 3063 and Jerusalem, 3389 and turned 5437-55 his name 8034 to Jehoiakim. 3079 And Necho 5224 took 3947-1 Jehoahaz 3099 his brother, 251 and carried 935-55 him to Egypt. 4714

36:5 Jehoiakim 3079 [was] twenty 6242 and five 2568 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 eleven 259 6240 years 8141 in Jerusalem: 3389 and he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD 3068 his God. 430

36:6 Against him came up 5927-1 Nebuchadnezzar 5019 king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and bound 631-4 him in fetters, 5178 to carry 3212-53 him to Babylon. 894

36:7 Nebuchadnezzar 5019 also carried 935-52 of the vessels 3627 of the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 to Babylon, 894 and put 5414-4 them in his temple 1964 at Babylon. 894

36:8 Now the rest 3499 of the acts 1697 of Jehoiakim, 3079 and his abominations 8441 which he did, 6213-1 and that which was found 4672-12 in him, behold, they [are] written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the kings 4428 of Israel 3478 and Judah: 3063 and Jehoiachin 3078 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

36:9 Jehoiachin 3078 [was] eight 8083 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and he reigned 4427-1 three 7969 months 2320 and ten 6235 days 3117 in Jerusalem: 3389 and he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD. 3068

36:10 And when the year 8141 was expired, 8666 king 4428 Nebuchadnezzar 5019 sent, 7971-1 and brought 935-55 him to Babylon, 894 with the goodly 2532 vessels 3627 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and made Zedekiah 6667 his brother 251 king 4427-55 over Judah 3063 and Jerusalem. 3389

36:11 Zedekiah 6667 [was] one 259 and twenty 6242 years 8141 old 1121 when he began to reign, 4427-2 and reigned 4427-1 eleven 259 6240 years 8141 in Jerusalem. 3389

36:12 And he did 6213-4 [that which was] evil 7451 in the sight 5869 of the LORD 3068 his God, 430 [and] humbled 3665-8 not himself before 6440 Jeremiah 3414 the prophet 5030 [speaking] from the mouth 6310 of the LORD. 3068

36:13 And he also rebelled 4775-1 against king 4428 Nebuchadnezzar, 5019 who had made him swear 7650-52 by God: 430 but he stiffened 7185-55 his neck, 6203 and hardened 553-17 his heart 3824 from turning 7725-2 unto the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel. 3478

36:14 Moreover all the chief 8269 of the priests, 3548 and the people, 5971 transgressed 4603-2 very 4604 much 7235-52 after all the abominations 8441 of the heathen; 1471 and polluted 2930-17 the house 1004 of the LORD 3068 which he had hallowed 6942-52 in Jerusalem. 3389

36:15 And the LORD 3068 God 430 of their fathers 1 sent 7971-4 to them by 3027 his messengers, 4397 rising up betimes, 7925-53 and sending; 7971-2 because he had compassion 2550-1 on his people, 5971 and on his dwelling place: 4583

36:16 But they mocked 3931-56 the messengers 4397 of God, 430 and despised 959-6 his words, 1697 and misused 8591-119 his prophets, 5030 until the wrath 2534 of the LORD 3068 arose 5927-2 against his people, 5971 till [there was] no remedy. 4832

36:17 Therefore he brought 5927-55 upon them the king 4428 of the Chaldees, 3778 who slew 2026-4 their young men 970 with the sword 2719 in the house 1004 of their sanctuary, 4720 and had no compassion 2550-1 upon young man 970 or maiden, 1330 old man, 2205 or him that stooped for age: 3486 he gave 5414-1 [them] all into his hand. 3027

36:18 And all the vessels 3627 of the house 1004 of God, 430 great 1419 and small, 6996 and the treasures 214 of the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and the treasures 214 of the king, 4428 and of his princes; 8269 all [these] he brought 935-52 to Babylon. 894

36:19 And they burnt 8313-4 the house 1004 of God, 430 and brake down 5422-17 the wall 2346 of Jerusalem, 3389 and burnt 8313-1 all the palaces 759 thereof with fire, 784 and destroyed 7843-53 all the goodly 4261 vessels 3627 thereof.

36:20 And them that had escaped 7611 from the sword 2719 carried he away 1540-55 to Babylon; 894 where they were servants 5650 to him and his sons 1121 until the reign 4427-2 of the kingdom 4438 of Persia: 6539

36:21 To fulfil 4390-15 the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 by the mouth 6310 of Jeremiah, 3414 until the land 776 had enjoyed 7521-1 her sabbaths: 7676 [for] as long as 3117 she lay desolate 8074-91 she kept sabbath, 7673-1 to fulfil 4390-15 threescore and ten 7657 years. 8141

36:22 Now in the first 259 year 8141 of Cyrus 3566 king 4428 of Persia, 6539 that the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 [spoken] by the mouth 6310 of Jeremiah 3414 might be accomplished, 3615-2 the LORD 3068 stirred up 5782-52 the spirit 7307 of Cyrus 3566 king 4428 of Persia, 6539 that he made a proclamation 5674-55 6963 throughout all his kingdom, 4438 and [put it] also in writing, 4385 saying, 559-2

36:23 Thus saith 559-1 Cyrus 3566 king 4428 of Persia, 6539 All the kingdoms 4467 of the earth 776 hath the LORD 3068 God 430 of heaven 8064 given 5414-1 me; and he hath charged 6485-1 me to build 1129-2 him an house 1004 in Jerusalem, 3389 which [is] in Judah. 3063 Who [is there] among you of all his people? 5971 The LORD 3068 his God 430 [be] with him, and let him go up. 5927-4
