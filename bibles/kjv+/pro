1:1 The proverbs 4912 of Solomon 8010 the son 1121 of David, 1732 king 4428 of Israel; 3478

1:2 To know 3045-2 wisdom 2451 and instruction; 4148 to perceive 995-53 the words 561 of understanding; 998

1:3 To receive 3947-2 the instruction 4148 of wisdom, 7919-53 justice, 6664 and judgment, 4941 and equity; 4339

1:4 To give 5414-2 subtilty 6195 to the simple, 6612 to the young man 5288 knowledge 1847 and discretion. 4209

1:5 A wise 2450 [man] will hear, 8085-4 and will increase 3254-55 learning; 3948 and a man of understanding 995-12 shall attain 7069-4 unto wise counsels: 8458

1:6 To understand 995-53 a proverb, 4912 and the interpretation; 4426 the words 1697 of the wise, 2450 and their dark sayings. 2420

1:7 The fear 3374 of the LORD 3068 [is] the beginning 7225 of knowledge: 1847 [but] fools 191 despise 936-1 wisdom 2451 and instruction. 4148

1:8 My son, 1121 hear 8085-3 the instruction 4148 of thy father, 1 and forsake 5203-4 not the law 8451 of thy mother: 517

1:9 For they [shall be] an ornament 3880 of grace 2580 unto thy head, 7218 and chains 6060 about thy neck. 1621

1:10 My son, 1121 if sinners 2400 entice 6601-17 thee, consent 14-4 thou not.

1:11 If they say, 559-4 Come 3212-3 with us, let us lay wait 693-4 for blood, 1818 let us lurk privily 6845-4 for the innocent 5355 without cause: 2600

1:12 Let us swallow them up 1104-4 alive 2416 as the grave; 7585 and whole, 8549 as those that go down 3381-6 into the pit: 953

1:13 We shall find 4672-4 all precious 3368 substance, 1952 we shall fill 4390-17 our houses 1004 with spoil: 7998

1:14 Cast 5307-55 in thy lot 1486 among 8432 us; let us all have one 259 purse: 3599

1:15 My son, 1121 walk 3212-4 not thou in the way 1870 with them; refrain 4513-3 thy foot 7272 from their path: 5410

1:16 For their feet 7272 run 7323-4 to evil, 7451 and make haste 4116-17 to shed 8210-2 blood. 1818

1:17 Surely in vain 2600 the net 7568 is spread 2219-30 in the sight 5869 of any bird. 1167 3671

1:18 And they lay wait 693-4 for their [own] blood; 1818 they lurk privily 6845-4 for their [own] lives. 5315

1:19 So [are] the ways 734 of every one that is greedy 1214-6 of gain; 1215 [which] taketh away 3947-4 the life 5315 of the owners 1167 thereof.

1:20 Wisdom 2454 crieth 7442-4 without; 2351 she uttereth 5414-4 her voice 6963 in the streets: 7339

1:21 She crieth 7121-4 in the chief place 7218 of concourse, 1993-6 in the openings 6607 of the gates: 8179 in the city 5892 she uttereth 559-4 her words, 561 [saying],

1:22 How long, ye simple ones, 6612 will ye love 157-4 simplicity? 6612 and the scorners 3887-5 delight 2530-1 in their scorning, 3944 and fools 3684 hate 8130-4 knowledge? 1847

1:23 Turn 7725-4 you at my reproof: 8433 behold, I will pour out 5042-55 my spirit 7307 unto you, I will make known 3045-55 my words 1697 unto you.

1:24 Because I have called, 7121-1 and ye refused; 3985-17 I have stretched out 5186-1 my hand, 3027 and no man regarded; 7181-56

1:25 But ye have set at nought 6544-4 all my counsel, 6098 and would 14-1 none of my reproof: 8433

1:26 I also will laugh 7832-4 at your calamity; 343 I will mock 3932-4 when your fear 6343 cometh; 935-2

1:27 When your fear 6343 cometh 935-2 as desolation, 7722|7584-k and your destruction 343 cometh 857-4 as a whirlwind; 5492 when distress 6869 and anguish 6695 cometh 935-2 upon you.

1:28 Then shall they call 7121-4 upon me, but I will not answer; 6030-4 they shall seek me early, 7836-17 but they shall not find 4672-4 me:

1:29 For that they hated 8130-1 knowledge, 1847 and did not choose 977-1 the fear 3374 of the LORD: 3068

1:30 They would 14-1 none of my counsel: 6098 they despised 5006-1 all my reproof. 8433

1:31 Therefore shall they eat 398-4 of the fruit 6529 of their own way, 1870 and be filled 7646-4 with their own devices. 4156

1:32 For the turning away 4878 of the simple 6612 shall slay 2026-4 them, and the prosperity 7962 of fools 3684 shall destroy 6-17 them.

1:33 But whoso hearkeneth 8085-6 unto me shall dwell 7931-4 safely, 983 and shall be quiet 7599-40 from fear 6343 of evil. 7451

2:1 My son, 1121 if thou wilt receive 3947-4 my words, 561 and hide 6845-4 my commandments 4687 with thee;

2:2 So that thou incline 7181-53 thine ear 241 unto wisdom, 2451 [and] apply 5186-55 thine heart 3820 to understanding; 8394

2:3 Yea, if thou criest 7121-4 after knowledge, 998 [and] liftest up 5414-4 thy voice 6963 for understanding; 8394

2:4 If thou seekest 1245-17 her as silver, 3701 and searchest 2664-4 for her as [for] hid treasures; 4301

2:5 Then shalt thou understand 995-4 the fear 3374 of the LORD, 3068 and find 4672-4 the knowledge 1847 of God. 430

2:6 For the LORD 3068 giveth 5414-4 wisdom: 2451 out of his mouth 6310 [cometh] knowledge 1847 and understanding. 8394

2:7 He layeth up 6845-4|6845-1-k sound wisdom 8454 for the righteous: 3477 [he is] a buckler 4043 to them that walk 1980-6 uprightly. 8537

2:8 He keepeth 5341-2 the paths 734 of judgment, 4941 and preserveth 8104-4 the way 1870 of his saints. 2623

2:9 Then shalt thou understand 995-4 righteousness, 6664 and judgment, 4941 and equity; 4339 [yea], every good 2896 path. 4570

2:10 When wisdom 2451 entereth 935-4 into thine heart, 3820 and knowledge 1847 is pleasant 5276-4 unto thy soul; 5315

2:11 Discretion 4209 shall preserve 8104-4 thee, understanding 8394 shall keep 5341-4 thee:

2:12 To deliver 5337-53 thee from the way 1870 of the evil 7451 [man], from the man 376 that speaketh 1696-18 froward things; 8419

2:13 Who leave 5800-6 the paths 734 of uprightness, 3476 to walk 3212-2 in the ways 1870 of darkness; 2822

2:14 Who rejoice 8056 to do 6213-2 evil, 7451 [and] delight 1523-4 in the frowardness 8419 of the wicked; 7451

2:15 Whose ways 734 [are] crooked, 6141 and [they] froward 3868-12 in their paths: 4570

2:16 To deliver 5337-53 thee from the strange 2114-5 woman, 802 [even] from the stranger 5237 [which] flattereth 2505-52 with her words; 561

2:17 Which forsaketh 5800-6 the guide 441 of her youth, 5271 and forgetteth 7911-1 the covenant 1285 of her God. 430

2:18 For her house 1004 inclineth 7743-1 unto death, 4194 and her paths 4570 unto the dead. 7496

2:19 None that go 935-6 unto her return again, 7725-4 neither take they hold 5381-55 of the paths 734 of life. 2416

2:20 That thou mayest walk 3212-4 in the way 1870 of good 2896 [men], and keep 8104-4 the paths 734 of the righteous. 6662

2:21 For the upright 3477 shall dwell 7931-4 in the land, 776 and the perfect 8549 shall remain 3498-11 in it.

2:22 But the wicked 7563 shall be cut off 3772-11 from the earth, 776 and the transgressors 898-6 shall be rooted 5255-4 out of it.

3:1 My son, 1121 forget 7911-4 not my law; 8451 but let thine heart 3820 keep 5341-4 my commandments: 4687

3:2 For length 753 of days, 3117 and long 8141 life, 2416 and peace, 7965 shall they add 3254-55 to thee.

3:3 Let not mercy 2617 and truth 571 forsake 5800-4 thee: bind 7194-3 them about thy neck; 1621 write 3789-3 them upon the table 3871 of thine heart: 3820

3:4 So shalt thou find 4672-3 favour 2580 and good 2896 understanding 7922 in the sight 5869 of God 430 and man. 120

3:5 Trust 982-3 in the LORD 3068 with all thine heart; 3820 and lean 8172-11 not unto thine own understanding. 998

3:6 In all thy ways 1870 acknowledge 3045-3 him, and he shall direct 3474-17 thy paths. 734

3:7 Be not wise 2450 in thine own eyes: 5869 fear 3372-3 the LORD, 3068 and depart 5493-3 from evil. 7451

3:8 It shall be health 7500 to thy navel, 8270 and marrow 8250 to thy bones. 6106

3:9 Honour 3513-16 the LORD 3068 with thy substance, 1952 and with the firstfruits 7225 of all thine increase: 8393

3:10 So shall thy barns 618 be filled 4390-11 with plenty, 7647 and thy presses 3342 shall burst out 6555-4 with new wine. 8492

3:11 My son, 1121 despise 3988-4 not the chastening 4148 of the LORD; 3068 neither be weary 6973-4 of his correction: 8433

3:12 For whom the LORD 3068 loveth 157-4 he correcteth; 3198-55 even as a father 1 the son 1121 [in whom] he delighteth. 7521-4

3:13 Happy 835 [is] the man 120 [that] findeth 4672-1 wisdom, 2451 and the man 120 [that] getteth 6329-55 understanding. 8394

3:14 For the merchandise 5504 of it [is] better 2896 than the merchandise 5505 of silver, 3701 and the gain 8393 thereof than fine gold. 2742

3:15 She [is] more precious 3368 than rubies: 6443 and all the things thou canst desire 2656 are not to be compared 7737-4 unto her.

3:16 Length 753 of days 3117 [is] in her right hand; 3225 [and] in her left hand 8040 riches 6239 and honour. 3519

3:17 Her ways 1870 [are] ways 1870 of pleasantness, 5278 and all her paths 5410 [are] peace. 7965

3:18 She [is] a tree 6086 of life 2416 to them that lay hold 2388-56 upon her: and happy 833-30 [is every one] that retaineth 8551-6 her.

3:19 The LORD 3068 by wisdom 2451 hath founded 3245-1 the earth; 776 by understanding 8394 hath he established 3559-31 the heavens. 8064

3:20 By his knowledge 1847 the depths 8415 are broken up, 1234-8 and the clouds 7834 drop down 7491-4 the dew. 2919

3:21 My son, 1121 let not them depart 3868-4 from thine eyes: 5869 keep 5341-3 sound wisdom 8454 and discretion: 4209

3:22 So shall they be life 2416 unto thy soul, 5315 and grace 2580 to thy neck. 1621

3:23 Then shalt thou walk 3212-4 in thy way 1870 safely, 983 and thy foot 7272 shall not stumble. 5062-4

3:24 When thou liest down, 7901-4 thou shalt not be afraid: 6342-4 yea, thou shalt lie down, 7901-1 and thy sleep 8142 shall be sweet. 6149-1

3:25 Be not afraid 3372-4 of sudden 6597 fear, 6343 neither of the desolation 7722 of the wicked, 7563 when it cometh. 935-4

3:26 For the LORD 3068 shall be thy confidence, 3689 and shall keep 8104-1 thy foot 7272 from being taken. 3921

3:27 Withhold 4513-4 not good 2896 from them to whom it is due, 1167 when it is in the power 410 of thine hand 3027 to do 6213-2 [it].

3:28 Say 559-4 not unto thy neighbour, 7453 Go, 3212-3 and come again, 7725-3 and to morrow 4279 I will give; 5414-4 when thou hast it 3426 by thee.

3:29 Devise 2790-4 not evil 7451 against thy neighbour, 7453 seeing he dwelleth 3427-6 securely 983 by thee.

3:30 Strive 7378-4 not with a man 120 without cause, 2600 if he have done 1580-1 thee no harm. 7451

3:31 Envy 7065-17 thou not the oppressor, 376 2555 and choose 977-4 none of his ways. 1870

3:32 For the froward 3868-12 [is] abomination 8441 to the LORD: 3068 but his secret 5475 [is] with the righteous. 3477

3:33 The curse 3994 of the LORD 3068 [is] in the house 1004 of the wicked: 7563 but he blesseth 1288-17 the habitation 5116 of the just. 6662

3:34 Surely he scorneth 3887-55 the scorners: 3887-5 but he giveth 5414-4 grace 2580 unto the lowly. 6035|6041-k

3:35 The wise 2450 shall inherit 5157-4 glory: 3519 but shame 7036 shall be the promotion 7311-56 of fools. 3684

4:1 Hear, 8085-3 ye children, 1121 the instruction 4148 of a father, 1 and attend 7181-54 to know 3045-2 understanding. 998

4:2 For I give 5414-1 you good 2896 doctrine, 3948 forsake 5800-4 ye not my law. 8451

4:3 For I was my father's 1 son, 1121 tender 7390 and only 3173 [beloved] in the sight 6440 of my mother. 517

4:4 He taught 3384-55 me also, and said 559-4 unto me, Let thine heart 3820 retain 8551-4 my words: 1697 keep 8104-3 my commandments, 4687 and live. 2421-3

4:5 Get 7069-3 wisdom, 2451 get 7069-3 understanding: 998 forget 7911-4 [it] not; neither decline 5186-4 from the words 561 of my mouth. 6310

4:6 Forsake 5800-4 her not, and she shall preserve 8104-4 thee: love 157-3 her, and she shall keep 5341-4 thee.

4:7 Wisdom 2451 [is] the principal thing; 7225 [therefore] get 7069-3 wisdom: 2451 and with all thy getting 7075 get 7069-3 understanding. 998

4:8 Exalt 5549-45 her, and she shall promote 7311-34 thee: she shall bring thee to honour, 3513-17 when thou dost embrace 2263-17 her.

4:9 She shall give 5414-4 to thine head 7218 an ornament 3880 of grace: 2580 a crown 5850 of glory 8597 shall she deliver 4042-17 to thee.

4:10 Hear, 8085-3 O my son, 1121 and receive 3947-3 my sayings; 561 and the years 8141 of thy life 2416 shall be many. 7235-4

4:11 I have taught 3384-52 thee in the way 1870 of wisdom; 2451 I have led 1869-52 thee in right 3476 paths. 4570

4:12 When thou goest, 3212-2 thy steps 6806 shall not be straitened; 3334-4 and when thou runnest, 7323-4 thou shalt not stumble. 3782-11

4:13 Take fast hold 2388-54 of instruction; 4148 let [her] not go: 7503-55 keep 5341-3 her; for she [is] thy life. 2416

4:14 Enter 935-4 not into the path 734 of the wicked, 7563 and go 833-17 not in the way 1870 of evil 7451 [men].

4:15 Avoid 6544-3 it, pass 5674-4 not by it, turn 7847-3 from it, and pass away. 5674-3

4:16 For they sleep 3462-4 not, except they have done mischief; 7489-55 and their sleep 8142 is taken away, 1497-8 unless they cause [some] to fall. 3782-55|3782-4-k

4:17 For they eat 3898-1 the bread 3899 of wickedness, 7562 and drink 8354-4 the wine 3196 of violence. 2555

4:18 But the path 734 of the just 6662 [is] as the shining 5051 light, 216 that shineth 215-1 more and more 1980-6 unto the perfect 3559-12 day. 3117

4:19 The way 1870 of the wicked 7563 [is] as darkness: 653 they know 3045-1 not at what they stumble. 3782-11

4:20 My son, 1121 attend 7181-54 to my words; 1697 incline 5186-54 thine ear 241 unto my sayings. 561

4:21 Let them not depart 3868-55 from thine eyes; 5869 keep 8104-3 them in the midst 8432 of thine heart. 3824

4:22 For they [are] life 2416 unto those that find 4672-6 them, and health 4832 to all their flesh. 1320

4:23 Keep 5341-3 thy heart 3820 with all diligence; 4929 for out of it [are] the issues 8444 of life. 2416

4:24 Put away 5493-54 from thee a froward 6143 mouth, 6310 and perverse 3891 lips 8193 put far 7368-54 from thee.

4:25 Let thine eyes 5869 look 5027-55 right on, 5227 and let thine eyelids 6079 look straight 3474-55 before thee.

4:26 Ponder 6424-16 the path 4570 of thy feet, 7272 and let all thy ways 1870 be established. 3559-11

4:27 Turn 5186-4 not to the right hand 3225 nor to the left: 8040 remove 5493-54 thy foot 7272 from evil. 7451

5:1 My son, 1121 attend 7181-54 unto my wisdom, 2451 [and] bow 5186-54 thine ear 241 to my understanding: 8394

5:2 That thou mayest regard 8104-2 discretion, 4209 and [that] thy lips 8193 may keep 5341-4 knowledge. 1847

5:3 For the lips 8193 of a strange woman 2114-5 drop 5197-4 [as] an honeycomb, 5317 and her mouth 2441 [is] smoother 2509 than oil: 8081

5:4 But her end 319 is bitter 4751 as wormwood, 3939 sharp 2299 as a twoedged 6310 sword. 2719

5:5 Her feet 7272 go down 3381-6 to death; 4194 her steps 6806 take hold 8551-4 on hell. 7585

5:6 Lest thou shouldest ponder 6424-17 the path 734 of life, 2416 her ways 4570 are moveable, 5128-1 [that] thou canst not know 3045-4 [them].

5:7 Hear 8085-3 me now therefore, O ye children, 1121 and depart 5493-4 not from the words 561 of my mouth. 6310

5:8 Remove thy way 1870 far 7368-54 from her, and come not nigh 7126-4 the door 6607 of her house: 1004

5:9 Lest thou give 5414-4 thine honour 1935 unto others, 312 and thy years 8141 unto the cruel: 394

5:10 Lest strangers 2114-5 be filled 7646-4 with thy wealth; 3581 and thy labours 6089 [be] in the house 1004 of a stranger; 5237

5:11 And thou mourn 5098-1 at the last, 319 when thy flesh 1320 and thy body 7607 are consumed, 3615-2

5:12 And say, 559-1 How have I hated 8130-1 instruction, 4148 and my heart 3820 despised 5006-1 reproof; 8433

5:13 And have not obeyed 8085-1 the voice 6963 of my teachers, 3384-56 nor inclined 5186-52 mine ear 241 to them that instructed 3925-18 me!

5:14 I was almost 4592 in all evil 7451 in the midst 8432 of the congregation 6951 and assembly. 5712

5:15 Drink 8354-3 waters 4325 out of thine own cistern, 953 and running waters 5140-6 out of 8432 thine own well. 875

5:16 Let thy fountains 4599 be dispersed 6327-4 abroad, 2351 [and] rivers 6388 of waters 4325 in the streets. 7339

5:17 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' 2114-5 with thee.

5:18 Let thy fountain 4726 be blessed: 1288-7 and rejoice 8055-3 with the wife 802 of thy youth. 5271

5:19 [Let her be as] the loving 158 hind 365 and pleasant 2580 roe; 3280 let her breasts 1717 satisfy 7301-17 thee at all times; 6256 and be thou ravished 7686-4 always 8548 with her love. 160

5:20 And why wilt thou, my son, 1121 be ravished 7686-4 with a strange woman, 2114-5 and embrace 2263-17 the bosom 2436 of a stranger? 5237

5:21 For the ways 1870 of man 376 [are] before 5227 the eyes 5869 of the LORD, 3068 and he pondereth 6424-18 all his goings. 4570

5:22 His own iniquities 5771 shall take 3920-4 the wicked 7563 himself, and he shall be holden 8551-11 with the cords 2256 of his sins. 2403

5:23 He shall die 4191-4 without instruction; 4148 and in the greatness 7230 of his folly 200 he shall go astray. 7686-4

6:1 My son, 1121 if thou be surety 6148-1 for thy friend, 7453 [if] thou hast stricken 8628-1 thy hand 3709 with a stranger, 2114-5

6:2 Thou art snared 3369-8 with the words 561 of thy mouth, 6310 thou art taken 3920-8 with the words 561 of thy mouth. 6310

6:3 Do 6213-3 this now, 645 my son, 1121 and deliver 5337-10 thyself, when thou art come 935-1 into the hand 3709 of thy friend; 7453 go, 3212-3 humble 7511-100 thyself, and make sure 7292-3 thy friend. 7453

6:4 Give 5414-4 not sleep 8142 to thine eyes, 5869 nor slumber 8572 to thine eyelids. 6079

6:5 Deliver 5337-10 thyself as a roe 6643 from the hand 3027 [of the hunter], and as a bird 6833 from the hand 3027 of the fowler. 3353

6:6 Go 3212-3 to the ant, 5244 thou sluggard; 6102 consider 7200-3 her ways, 1870 and be wise: 2449-3

6:7 Which having no guide, 7101 overseer, 7860-6 or ruler, 4910-6

6:8 Provideth 3559-55 her meat 3899 in the summer, 7019 [and] gathereth 103-1 her food 3978 in the harvest. 7105

6:9 How long wilt thou sleep, 7901-4 O sluggard? 6102 when wilt thou arise 6965-4 out of thy sleep? 8142

6:10 [Yet] a little 4592 sleep, 8142 a little 4592 slumber, 8572 a little 4592 folding 2264 of the hands 3027 to sleep: 7901-2

6:11 So shall thy poverty 7389 come 935-1 as one that travelleth, 1980-18 and thy want 4270 as an armed 4043 man. 376

6:12 A naughty 1100 person, 120 a wicked 205 man, 376 walketh 1980-6 with a froward 6143 mouth. 6310

6:13 He winketh 7169-6 with his eyes, 5869 he speaketh 4448-6 with his feet, 7272 he teacheth 3384-56 with his fingers; 676

6:14 Frowardness 8419 [is] in his heart, 3820 he deviseth 2790-6 mischief 7451 continually; 6256 he soweth 7971-17 discord. 4066|4090-k

6:15 Therefore shall his calamity 343 come 935-4 suddenly; 6597 suddenly 6621 shall he be broken 7665-11 without remedy. 4832

6:16 These six 8337 [things] doth the LORD 3068 hate: 8130-1 yea, seven 7651 [are] an abomination 8441 unto him: 5315

6:17 A proud 7311-6 look, 5869 a lying 8267 tongue, 3956 and hands 3027 that shed 8210-6 innocent 5355 blood, 1818

6:18 An heart 3820 that deviseth 2790-6 wicked 205 imaginations, 4284 feet 7272 that be swift 4116-18 in running 7323-2 to mischief, 7451

6:19 A false 8267 witness 5707 [that] speaketh 6315-55 lies, 3577 and he that soweth 7971-18 discord 4090 among brethren. 251

6:20 My son, 1121 keep 5341-3 thy father's 1 commandment, 4687 and forsake 5203-4 not the law 8451 of thy mother: 517

6:21 Bind 7194-3 them continually 8548 upon thine heart, 3820 [and] tie 6029-3 them about thy neck. 1621

6:22 When thou goest, 1980-99 it shall lead 5148-55 thee; when thou sleepest, 7901-2 it shall keep 8104-4 thee; and [when] thou awakest, 6974-52 it shall talk 7878-4 with thee.

6:23 For the commandment 4687 [is] a lamp; 5216 and the law 8451 [is] light; 216 and reproofs 8433 of instruction 4148 [are] the way 1870 of life: 2416

6:24 To keep 8104-2 thee from the evil 7451 woman, 802 from the flattery 2513 of the tongue 3956 of a strange 5237 woman.

6:25 Lust 2530-4 not after her beauty 3308 in thine heart; 3824 neither let her take 3947-4 thee with her eyelids. 6079

6:26 For by means of 1157 a whorish 2181-6 woman 802 [a man is brought] to a piece 3603 of bread: 3899 and the adulteress 802 376 will hunt 6679-4 for the precious 3368 life. 5315

6:27 Can a man 376 take 2846-4 fire 784 in his bosom, 2436 and his clothes 899 not be burned? 8313-11

6:28 Can one 376 go 1980-17 upon hot coals, 1513 and his feet 7272 not be burned? 3554-11

6:29 So he that goeth in 935-6 to his neighbour's 7453 wife; 802 whosoever toucheth 5060-6 her shall not be innocent. 5352-11

6:30 [Men] do not despise 936-4 a thief, 1590 if he steal 1589-4 to satisfy 4390-15 his soul 5315 when he is hungry; 7456-4

6:31 But [if] he be found, 4672-8 he shall restore 7999-17 sevenfold; 7659 he shall give 5414-4 all the substance 1952 of his house. 1004

6:32 [But] whoso committeth adultery 5003-6 with a woman 802 lacketh 2638 understanding: 3820 he [that] doeth 6213-4 it destroyeth 7843-56 his own soul. 5315

6:33 A wound 5061 and dishonour 7036 shall he get; 4672-4 and his reproach 2781 shall not be wiped away. 4229-11

6:34 For jealousy 7068 [is] the rage 2534 of a man: 1397 therefore he will not spare 2550-4 in the day 3117 of vengeance. 5359

6:35 He will not regard 5375-4 6440 any ransom; 3724 neither will he rest content, 14-4 though thou givest many 7235-55 gifts. 7810

7:1 My son, 1121 keep 8104-3 my words, 561 and lay up 6845-4 my commandments 4687 with thee.

7:2 Keep 8104-3 my commandments, 4687 and live; 2421-3 and my law 8451 as the apple 380 of thine eye. 5869

7:3 Bind 7194-3 them upon thy fingers, 676 write 3789-3 them upon the table 3871 of thine heart. 3820

7:4 Say 559-3 unto wisdom, 2451 Thou [art] my sister; 269 and call 7121-4 understanding 998 [thy] kinswoman: 4129

7:5 That they may keep 8104-2 thee from the strange 2114-5 woman, 802 from the stranger 5237 [which] flattereth 2505-52 with her words. 561

7:6 For at the window 2474 of my house 1004 I looked 8259-8 through my casement, 822

7:7 And beheld 7200-4 among the simple ones, 6612 I discerned 995-4 among the youths, 1121 a young man 5288 void 2638 of understanding, 3820

7:8 Passing 5674-6 through the street 7784 near 681 her corner; 6434 and he went 6805-4 the way 1870 to her house, 1004

7:9 In the twilight, 5399 in the evening, 3117 6153 in the black 380 and dark 653 night: 3915

7:10 And, behold, there met 7125-2 him a woman 802 [with] the attire 7897 of an harlot, 2181-6 and subtil 5341-7 of heart. 3820

7:11 (She [is] loud 1993-6 and stubborn; 5637-6 her feet 7272 abide 7931-4 not in her house: 1004

7:12 Now 6471 [is she] without, 2351 now 6471 in the streets, 7339 and lieth in wait 693-4 at 681 every corner.) 6438

7:13 So she caught 2388-52 him, and kissed 5401-1 him, [and] with an impudent 5810-52 face 6440 said 559-4 unto him,

7:14 [I have] peace 8002 offerings 2077 with me; this day 3117 have I payed 7999-14 my vows. 5088

7:15 Therefore came I forth 3318-1 to meet 7125-2 thee, diligently to seek 7836-15 thy face, 6440 and I have found 4672-4 thee.

7:16 I have decked 7234-1 my bed 6210 with coverings of tapestry, 4765 with carved 2405 [works], with fine linen 330 of Egypt. 4714

7:17 I have perfumed 5130-1 my bed 4904 with myrrh, 4753 aloes, 174 and cinnamon. 7076

7:18 Come, 3212-3 let us take our fill 7301-4 of love 1730 until the morning: 1242 let us solace 5965-101 ourselves with loves. 159

7:19 For the goodman 376 [is] not at home, 1004 he is gone 1980-1 a long 7350 journey: 1870

7:20 He hath taken 3947-1 a bag 6872 of money 3701 with him, 3027 [and] will come 935-4 home 1004 at the day 3117 appointed. 3677

7:21 With her much 7230 fair speech 3948 she caused him to yield, 5186-52 with the flattering 2506 of her lips 8193 she forced 5080-55 him.

7:22 He goeth 1980-6 after 310 her straightway, 6597 as an ox 7794 goeth 935-4 to the slaughter, 2874 or as a fool 191 to the correction 4148 of the stocks; 5914

7:23 Till a dart 2671 strike through 6398-17 his liver; 3516 as a bird 6833 hasteth 4116-15 to the snare, 6341 and knoweth 3045-1 not that it [is] for his life. 5315

7:24 Hearken 8085-3 unto me now therefore, O ye children, 1121 and attend 7181-54 to the words 561 of my mouth. 6310

7:25 Let not thine heart 3820 decline 7847-4 to her ways, 1870 go not astray 8582-4 in her paths. 5410

7:26 For she hath cast down 5307-52 many 7227 wounded: 2491 yea, many strong 6099 [men] have been slain 2026-7 by her.

7:27 Her house 1004 [is] the way 1870 to hell, 7585 going down 3381-6 to the chambers 2315 of death. 4194

8:1 Doth not wisdom 2451 cry? 7121-4 and understanding 8394 put forth 5414-4 her voice? 6963

8:2 She standeth 5324-8 in the top 7218 of high places, 4791 by the way 1870 in the places 1004 of the paths. 5410

8:3 She crieth 7442-4 at 3027 the gates, 8179 at the entry 6310 of the city, 7176 at the coming in 3996 at the doors. 6607

8:4 Unto you, O men, 376 I call; 7121-4 and my voice 6963 [is] to the sons 1121 of man. 120

8:5 O ye simple, 6612 understand 995-54 wisdom: 6195 and, ye fools, 3684 be ye of an understanding 995-54 heart. 3820

8:6 Hear; 8085-3 for I will speak 1696-17 of excellent things; 5057 and the opening 4669 of my lips 8193 [shall be] right things. 4339

8:7 For my mouth 2441 shall speak 1897-4 truth; 571 and wickedness 7562 [is] an abomination 8441 to my lips. 8193

8:8 All the words 561 of my mouth 6310 [are] in righteousness; 6664 [there is] nothing froward 6617-12 or perverse 6141 in them.

8:9 They [are] all plain 5228 to him that understandeth, 995-56 and right 3477 to them that find 4672-6 knowledge. 1847

8:10 Receive 3947-3 my instruction, 4148 and not silver; 3701 and knowledge 1847 rather than choice 977-12 gold. 2742

8:11 For wisdom 2451 [is] better 2896 than rubies; 6443 and all the things that may be desired 2656 are not to be compared 7737-4 to it.

8:12 I wisdom 2451 dwell 7931-1 with prudence, 6195 and find out 4672-4 knowledge 1847 of witty inventions. 4209

8:13 The fear 3374 of the LORD 3068 [is] to hate 8130-2 evil: 7451 pride, 1344 and arrogancy, 1347 and the evil 7451 way, 1870 and the froward 8419 mouth, 6310 do I hate. 8130-1

8:14 Counsel 6098 [is] mine, and sound wisdom: 8454 I [am] understanding; 998 I have strength. 1369

8:15 By me kings 4428 reign, 4427-4 and princes 7336-6 decree 2710-25 justice. 6664

8:16 By me princes 8269 rule, 8323-4 and nobles, 5081 [even] all the judges 8199-6 of the earth. 776

8:17 I love 157-4 them that love 157-6 me; and those that seek me early 7836-18 shall find 4672-4 me.

8:18 Riches 6239 and honour 3519 [are] with me; [yea], durable 6276 riches 1952 and righteousness. 6666

8:19 My fruit 6529 [is] better 2896 than gold, 2742 yea, than fine gold; 6337 and my revenue 8393 than choice 977-12 silver. 3701

8:20 I lead 1980-17 in the way 734 of righteousness, 6666 in the midst 8432 of the paths 5410 of judgment: 4941

8:21 That I may cause those that love 157-6 me to inherit 5157-53 substance; 3426 and I will fill 4390-17 their treasures. 214

8:22 The LORD 3068 possessed 7069-1 me in the beginning 7225 of his way, 1870 before 6924 his works 4659 of old.

8:23 I was set up 5258-8 from everlasting, 5769 from the beginning, 7218 or ever 6924 the earth 776 was.

8:24 When [there were] no depths, 8415 I was brought forth; 2342-49 when [there were] no fountains 4599 abounding 3513-12 with water. 4325

8:25 Before the mountains 2022 were settled, 2883-90 before 6440 the hills 1389 was I brought forth: 2342-49

8:26 While as yet he had not made 6213-1 the earth, 776 nor the fields, 2351 nor the highest part 7218 of the dust 6083 of the world. 8398

8:27 When he prepared 3559-53 the heavens, 8064 I [was] there: when he set 2710-2 a compass 2329 upon the face 6440 of the depth: 8415

8:28 When he established 553-15 the clouds 7834 above: 4605 when he strengthened 5810-2 the fountains 5869 of the deep: 8415

8:29 When he gave 7760-2 to the sea 3220 his decree, 2706 that the waters 4325 should not pass 5674-4 his commandment: 6310 when he appointed 2710-2 the foundations 4144 of the earth: 776

8:30 Then I was by him, 681 [as] one brought up 525 [with him]: and I was daily 3117 3117 [his] delight, 8191 rejoicing 7832-18 always 6256 before 6440 him;

8:31 Rejoicing 7832-18 in the habitable part 8398 of his earth; 776 and my delights 8191 [were] with the sons 1121 of men. 120

8:32 Now therefore hearken 8085-3 unto me, O ye children: 1121 for blessed 835 [are they that] keep 8104-4 my ways. 1870

8:33 Hear 8085-3 instruction, 4148 and be wise, 2449-3 and refuse 6544-4 it not.

8:34 Blessed 835 [is] the man 120 that heareth 8085-6 me, watching 8245-2 daily 3117 3117 at my gates, 1817 waiting 8104-2 at the posts 4201 of my doors. 6607

8:35 For whoso findeth 4672-6 me findeth 4672-1|4672-6-k life, 2416 and shall obtain 6329-55 favour 7522 of the LORD. 3068

8:36 But he that sinneth 2398-6 against me wrongeth 2554-6 his own soul: 5315 all they that hate 8130-18 me love 157-1 death. 4194

9:1 Wisdom 2454 hath builded 1129-1 her house, 1004 she hath hewn out 2672-1 her seven 7651 pillars: 5982

9:2 She hath killed 2873-1 her beasts; 2874 she hath mingled 4537-1 her wine; 3196 she hath also furnished 6186-1 her table. 7979

9:3 She hath sent forth 7971-1 her maidens: 5291 she crieth 7121-4 upon the highest places 1610 4791 of the city, 7176

9:4 Whoso [is] simple, 6612 let him turn in 5493-4 hither: [as for] him that wanteth 2638 understanding, 3820 she saith 559-1 to him,

9:5 Come, 3212-3 eat 3898-3 of my bread, 3899 and drink 8354-3 of the wine 3196 [which] I have mingled. 4537-1

9:6 Forsake 5800-3 the foolish, 6612 and live; 2421-3 and go 833-3 in the way 1870 of understanding. 998

9:7 He that reproveth 3256-6 a scorner 3887-5 getteth 3947-6 to himself shame: 7036 and he that rebuketh 3198-56 a wicked 7563 [man getteth] himself a blot. 3971

9:8 Reprove 3198-55 not a scorner, 3887-5 lest he hate 8130-4 thee: rebuke 3198-54 a wise man, 2450 and he will love 157-4 thee.

9:9 Give 5414-3 [instruction] to a wise 2450 [man], and he will be yet wiser: 2449-4 teach 3045-54 a just 6662 [man], and he will increase 3254-55 in learning. 3948

9:10 The fear 3374 of the LORD 3068 [is] the beginning 8462 of wisdom: 2451 and the knowledge 1847 of the holy 6918 [is] understanding. 998

9:11 For by me thy days 3117 shall be multiplied, 7235-4 and the years 8141 of thy life 2416 shall be increased. 3254-55

9:12 If thou be wise, 2449-1 thou shalt be wise 2449-1 for thyself: but [if] thou scornest, 3887-1 thou alone shalt bear 5375-4 [it].

9:13 A foolish 3687 woman 802 [is] clamorous: 1993-6 [she is] simple, 6615 and knoweth 3045-1 nothing. 1077 4100

9:14 For she sitteth 3427-1 at the door 6607 of her house, 1004 on a seat 3678 in the high places 4791 of the city, 7176

9:15 To call 7121-2 passengers 5674-6 1870 who go right 3474-18 on their ways: 734

9:16 Whoso [is] simple, 6612 let him turn in 5493-4 hither: and [as for] him that wanteth 2638 understanding, 3820 she saith 559-1 to him,

9:17 Stolen 1589-7 waters 4325 are sweet, 4985-4 and bread 3899 [eaten] in secret 5643 is pleasant. 5276-4

9:18 But he knoweth 3045-1 not that the dead 7496 [are] there; [and that] her guests 7121-7 [are] in the depths 6012 of hell. 7585

10:1 The proverbs 4912 of Solomon. 8010 A wise 2450 son 1121 maketh a glad 8055-17 father: 1 but a foolish 3684 son 1121 [is] the heaviness 8424 of his mother. 517

10:2 Treasures 214 of wickedness 7562 profit 3276-55 nothing: but righteousness 6666 delivereth 5337-55 from death. 4194

10:3 The LORD 3068 will not suffer the soul 5315 of the righteous 6662 to famish: 7456-55 but he casteth away 1920-4 the substance 1942 of the wicked. 7563

10:4 He becometh poor 7326-6 that dealeth 6213-6 [with] a slack 7423 hand: 3709 but the hand 3027 of the diligent 2742 maketh rich. 6238-55

10:5 He that gathereth 103-6 in summer 7019 [is] a wise 7919-56 son: 1121 [but] he that sleepeth 7290-12 in harvest 7105 [is] a son 1121 that causeth shame. 954-56

10:6 Blessings 1293 [are] upon the head 7218 of the just: 6662 but violence 2555 covereth 3680-17 the mouth 6310 of the wicked. 7563

10:7 The memory 2143 of the just 6662 [is] blessed: 1293 but the name 8034 of the wicked 7563 shall rot. 7537-4

10:8 The wise 2450 in heart 3820 will receive 3947-4 commandments: 4687 but a prating 8193 fool 191 shall fall. 3832-11

10:9 He that walketh 1980-6 uprightly 8537 walketh 3212-4 surely: 983 but he that perverteth 6140-18 his ways 1870 shall be known. 3045-11

10:10 He that winketh 7169-6 with the eye 5869 causeth 5414-4 sorrow: 6094 but a prating 8193 fool 191 shall fall. 3832-11

10:11 The mouth 6310 of a righteous 6662 [man is] a well 4726 of life: 2416 but violence 2555 covereth 3680-17 the mouth 6310 of the wicked. 7563

10:12 Hatred 8135 stirreth up 5782-34 strifes: 4090 but love 160 covereth 3680-17 all sins. 6588

10:13 In the lips 8193 of him that hath understanding 995-12 wisdom 2451 is found: 4672-11 but a rod 7626 [is] for the back 1460 of him that is void 2638 of understanding. 3820

10:14 Wise 2450 [men] lay up 6845-4 knowledge: 1847 but the mouth 6310 of the foolish 191 [is] near 7138 destruction. 4288

10:15 The rich 6223 man's wealth 1952 [is] his strong 5797 city: 7151 the destruction 4288 of the poor 1800 [is] their poverty. 7389

10:16 The labour 6468 of the righteous 6662 [tendeth] to life: 2416 the fruit 8393 of the wicked 7563 to sin. 2403

10:17 He [is in] the way 734 of life 2416 that keepeth 8104-6 instruction: 4148 but he that refuseth 5800-6 reproof 8433 erreth. 8582-56

10:18 He that hideth 3680-18 hatred 8135 [with] lying 8267 lips, 8193 and he that uttereth 3318-56 a slander, 1681 [is] a fool. 3684

10:19 In the multitude 7230 of words 1697 there wanteth 2308-4 not sin: 6588 but he that refraineth 2820-6 his lips 8193 [is] wise. 7919-56

10:20 The tongue 3956 of the just 6662 [is as] choice 977-12 silver: 3701 the heart 3820 of the wicked 7563 [is] little 4592 worth.

10:21 The lips 8193 of the righteous 6662 feed 7462-4 many: 7227 but fools 191 die 4191-4 for want 2638 of wisdom. 3820

10:22 The blessing 1293 of the LORD, 3068 it maketh rich, 6238-55 and he addeth 3254-55 no sorrow 6089 with it.

10:23 [It is] as sport 7814 to a fool 3684 to do 6213-2 mischief: 2154 but a man 376 of understanding 8394 hath wisdom. 2451

10:24 The fear 4034 of the wicked, 7563 it shall come 935-4 upon him: but the desire 8378 of the righteous 6662 shall be granted. 5414-4

10:25 As the whirlwind 5492 passeth, 5674-2 so [is] the wicked 7563 no [more]: but the righteous 6662 [is] an everlasting 5769 foundation. 3247

10:26 As vinegar 2558 to the teeth, 8127 and as smoke 6227 to the eyes, 5869 so [is] the sluggard 6102 to them that send 7971-6 him.

10:27 The fear 3374 of the LORD 3068 prolongeth 3254-55 days: 3117 but the years 8141 of the wicked 7563 shall be shortened. 7114-4

10:28 The hope 8431 of the righteous 6662 [shall be] gladness: 8057 but the expectation 8615 of the wicked 7563 shall perish. 6-4

10:29 The way 1870 of the LORD 3068 [is] strength 4581 to the upright: 8537 but destruction 4288 [shall be] to the workers 6466-6 of iniquity. 205

10:30 The righteous 6662 shall never 1077 5769 be removed: 4131-11 but the wicked 7563 shall not inhabit 7931-4 the earth. 776

10:31 The mouth 6310 of the just 6662 bringeth forth 5107-4 wisdom: 2451 but the froward 8419 tongue 3956 shall be cut out. 3772-11

10:32 The lips 8193 of the righteous 6662 know 3045-4 what is acceptable: 7522 but the mouth 6310 of the wicked 7563 [speaketh] frowardness. 8419

11:1 A false 4820 balance 3976 [is] abomination 8441 to the LORD: 3068 but a just 8003 weight 68 [is] his delight. 7522

11:2 [When] pride 2087 cometh, 935-1 then cometh 935-4 shame: 7036 but with the lowly 6800-7 [is] wisdom. 2451

11:3 The integrity 8538 of the upright 3477 shall guide 5148-55 them: but the perverseness 5558 of transgressors 898-6 shall destroy 7703-4|7703-1-k them.

11:4 Riches 1952 profit 3276-55 not in the day 3117 of wrath: 5678 but righteousness 6666 delivereth 5337-55 from death. 4194

11:5 The righteousness 6666 of the perfect 8549 shall direct 3474-17 his way: 1870 but the wicked 7563 shall fall 5307-4 by his own wickedness. 7564

11:6 The righteousness 6666 of the upright 3477 shall deliver 5337-55 them: but transgressors 898-6 shall be taken 3920-11 in [their own] naughtiness. 1942

11:7 When a wicked 7563 man 120 dieth, 4194 [his] expectation 8615 shall perish: 6-4 and the hope 8431 of unjust 205 [men] perisheth. 6-1

11:8 The righteous 6662 is delivered 2502-8 out of trouble, 6869 and the wicked 7563 cometh 935-4 in his stead.

11:9 An hypocrite 2611 with [his] mouth 6310 destroyeth 7843-55 his neighbour: 7453 but through knowledge 1847 shall the just 6662 be delivered. 2502-11

11:10 When it goeth well 2898 with the righteous, 6662 the city 7151 rejoiceth: 5970-4 and when the wicked 7563 perish, 6-2 [there is] shouting. 7440

11:11 By the blessing 1293 of the upright 3477 the city 7176 is exalted: 7311-4 but it is overthrown 2040-11 by the mouth 6310 of the wicked. 7563

11:12 He that is void 2638 of wisdom 3820 despiseth 936-6 his neighbour: 7453 but a man 376 of understanding 8394 holdeth his peace. 2790-55

11:13 A talebearer 1980-6 7400 revealeth 1540-18 secrets: 5475 but he that is of a faithful 539-8 spirit 7307 concealeth 3680-18 the matter. 1697

11:14 Where no counsel 8458 [is], the people 5971 fall: 5307-4 but in the multitude 7230 of counsellors 3289-6 [there is] safety. 8668

11:15 He that is surety 6148-1 for a stranger 2114-5 shall smart 7321-11 7451 [for it]: and he that hateth 8130-6 suretiship 8628-6 is sure. 982-6

11:16 A gracious 2580 woman 802 retaineth 8551-4 honour: 3519 and strong 6184 [men] retain 8551-4 riches. 6239

11:17 The merciful 2617 man 376 doeth good 1580-6 to his own soul: 5315 but [he that is] cruel 394 troubleth 5916-6 his own flesh. 7607

11:18 The wicked 7563 worketh 6213-6 a deceitful 8267 work: 6468 but to him that soweth 2232-6 righteousness 6666 [shall be] a sure 571 reward. 7938

11:19 As righteousness 6666 [tendeth] to life: 2416 so he that pursueth 7291-18 evil 7451 [pursueth it] to his own death. 4194

11:20 They that are of a froward 6141 heart 3820 [are] abomination 8441 to the LORD: 3068 but [such as are] upright 8549 in [their] way 1870 [are] his delight. 7522

11:21 [Though] hand 3027 [join] in hand, 3027 the wicked 7451 shall not be unpunished: 5352-11 but the seed 2233 of the righteous 6662 shall be delivered. 4422-8

11:22 [As] a jewel 5141 of gold 2091 in a swine's 2386 snout, 639 [so is] a fair 3303 woman 802 which is without 5493-6 discretion. 2940

11:23 The desire 8378 of the righteous 6662 [is] only good: 2896 [but] the expectation 8615 of the wicked 7563 [is] wrath. 5678

11:24 There is 3426 that scattereth, 6340-18 and yet increaseth; 3254-12 and [there is] that withholdeth 2820-6 more than is meet, 3476 but [it tendeth] to poverty. 4270

11:25 The liberal 1293 soul 5315 shall be made fat: 1878-29 and he that watereth 7301-56 shall be watered 3384-55 also himself.

11:26 He that withholdeth 4513-6 corn, 1250 the people 3816 shall curse 5344-4 him: but blessing 1293 [shall be] upon the head 7218 of him that selleth 7666-56 [it].

11:27 He that diligently seeketh 7836-6 good 2896 procureth 1245-17 favour: 7522 but he that seeketh 1875-6 mischief, 7451 it shall come 935-4 unto him.

11:28 He that trusteth 982-6 in his riches 6239 shall fall: 5307-4 but the righteous 6662 shall flourish 6524-4 as a branch. 5929

11:29 He that troubleth 5916-6 his own house 1004 shall inherit 5157-4 the wind: 7307 and the fool 191 [shall be] servant 5650 to the wise 2450 of heart. 3820

11:30 The fruit 6529 of the righteous 6662 [is] a tree 6086 of life; 2416 and he that winneth 3947-6 souls 5315 [is] wise. 2450

11:31 Behold, the righteous 6662 shall be recompensed 7999-29 in the earth: 776 much more the wicked 7563 and the sinner. 2398-6

12:1 Whoso loveth 157-6 instruction 4148 loveth 157-6 knowledge: 1847 but he that hateth 8130-6 reproof 8433 [is] brutish. 1198

12:2 A good 2896 [man] obtaineth 6329-55 favour 7522 of the LORD: 3068 but a man 376 of wicked devices 4209 will he condemn. 7561-55

12:3 A man 120 shall not be established 3559-11 by wickedness: 7562 but the root 8328 of the righteous 6662 shall not be moved. 4131-11

12:4 A virtuous 2428 woman 802 [is] a crown 5850 to her husband: 1167 but she that maketh ashamed 954-56 [is] as rottenness 7538 in his bones. 6106

12:5 The thoughts 4284 of the righteous 6662 [are] right: 4941 [but] the counsels 8458 of the wicked 7563 [are] deceit. 4820

12:6 The words 1697 of the wicked 7563 [are] to lie in wait 693-2 for blood: 1818 but the mouth 6310 of the upright 3477 shall deliver 5337-55 them.

12:7 The wicked 7563 are overthrown, 2015-2 and [are] not: but the house 1004 of the righteous 6662 shall stand. 5975-4

12:8 A man 376 shall be commended 1984-29 according 6310 to his wisdom: 7922 but he that is of a perverse 5753-12 heart 3820 shall be despised. 937

12:9 [He that is] despised, 7034-12 and hath a servant, 5650 [is] better 2896 than he that honoureth 3513-102 himself, and lacketh 2638 bread. 3899

12:10 A righteous 6662 [man] regardeth 3045-6 the life 5315 of his beast: 929 but the tender mercies 7356 of the wicked 7563 [are] cruel. 394

12:11 He that tilleth 5647-6 his land 127 shall be satisfied 7646-4 with bread: 3899 but he that followeth 7291-18 vain 7386 [persons is] void 2638 of understanding. 3820

12:12 The wicked 7563 desireth 2530-1 the net 4685 of evil 7451 [men]: but the root 8328 of the righteous 6662 yieldeth 5414-4 [fruit].

12:13 The wicked 7451 is snared 4170 by the transgression 6588 of [his] lips: 8193 but the just 6662 shall come out 3318-4 of trouble. 6869

12:14 A man 376 shall be satisfied 7646-4 with good 2896 by the fruit 6529 of [his] mouth: 6310 and the recompence 1576 of a man's 120 hands 3027 shall be rendered 7725-55|7725-4-k unto him.

12:15 The way 1870 of a fool 191 [is] right 3477 in his own eyes: 5869 but he that hearkeneth 8085-6 unto counsel 6098 [is] wise. 2450

12:16 A fool's 191 wrath 3708 is presently 3117 known: 3045-11 but a prudent 6175 [man] covereth 3680-6 shame. 7036

12:17 [He that] speaketh 6315-55 truth 530 sheweth forth 5046-55 righteousness: 6664 but a false 8267 witness 5707 deceit. 4820

12:18 There is 3426 that speaketh 981-6 like the piercings 4094 of a sword: 2719 but the tongue 3956 of the wise 2450 [is] health. 4832

12:19 The lip 8193 of truth 571 shall be established 3559-11 for ever: 5703 but a lying 8267 tongue 3956 [is] but for a moment. 7280-55

12:20 Deceit 4820 [is] in the heart 3820 of them that imagine 2790-6 evil: 7451 but to the counsellors 3289-6 of peace 7965 [is] joy. 8057

12:21 There shall no evil 205 happen 579-29 to the just: 6662 but the wicked 7563 shall be filled 4390-1 with mischief. 7451

12:22 Lying 8267 lips 8193 [are] abomination 8441 to the LORD: 3068 but they that deal 6213-6 truly 530 [are] his delight. 7522

12:23 A prudent 6175 man 120 concealeth 3680-6 knowledge: 1847 but the heart 3820 of fools 3684 proclaimeth 7121-4 foolishness. 200

12:24 The hand 3027 of the diligent 2742 shall bear rule: 4910-4 but the slothful 7423 shall be under tribute. 4522

12:25 Heaviness 1674 in the heart 3820 of man 376 maketh it stoop: 7812-55 but a good 2896 word 1697 maketh it glad. 8055-17

12:26 The righteous 6662 [is] more excellent 8446-55 than his neighbour: 7453 but the way 1870 of the wicked 7563 seduceth 8582-55 them.

12:27 The slothful 7423 [man] roasteth 2760-4 not that which he took in hunting: 6718 but the substance 1952 of a diligent 2742 man 120 [is] precious. 3368

12:28 In the way 734 of righteousness 6666 [is] life; 2416 and [in] the pathway 5410 1870 [thereof there is] no death. 4194

13:1 A wise 2450 son 1121 [heareth] his father's 1 instruction: 4148 but a scorner 3887-5 heareth 8085-1 not rebuke. 1606

13:2 A man 376 shall eat 398-4 good 2896 by the fruit 6529 of [his] mouth: 6310 but the soul 5315 of the transgressors 898-6 [shall eat] violence. 2555

13:3 He that keepeth 5341-6 his mouth 6310 keepeth 8104-6 his life: 5315 [but] he that openeth wide 6589-6 his lips 8193 shall have destruction. 4288

13:4 The soul 5315 of the sluggard 6102 desireth, 183-102 and [hath] nothing: but the soul 5315 of the diligent 2742 shall be made fat. 1878-29

13:5 A righteous 6662 [man] hateth 8130-4 lying: 1697 8267 but a wicked 7563 [man] is loathsome, 887-55 and cometh to shame. 2659-55

13:6 Righteousness 6666 keepeth 5341-4 [him that is] upright 8537 in the way: 1870 but wickedness 7564 overthroweth 5557-17 the sinner. 2403

13:7 There is 3426 that maketh himself rich, 6238-102 yet [hath] nothing: 369 3605 [there is] that maketh himself poor, 7326-114 yet [hath] great 7227 riches. 1952

13:8 The ransom 3724 of a man's 376 life 5315 [are] his riches: 6239 but the poor 7326-6 heareth 8085-1 not rebuke. 1606

13:9 The light 216 of the righteous 6662 rejoiceth: 8055-4 but the lamp 5216 of the wicked 7563 shall be put out. 1846-4

13:10 Only by pride 2087 cometh 5414-4 contention: 4683 but with the well advised 3289-12 [is] wisdom. 2451

13:11 Wealth 1952 [gotten] by vanity 1892 shall be diminished: 4591-4 but he that gathereth 6908-6 by labour 3027 shall increase. 7235-55

13:12 Hope 8431 deferred 4900-30 maketh the heart 3820 sick: 2470-56 but [when] the desire 8378 cometh, 935-6 [it is] a tree 6086 of life. 2416

13:13 Whoso despiseth 936-6 the word 1697 shall be destroyed: 2254-11 but he that feareth 3373 the commandment 4687 shall be rewarded. 7999-29

13:14 The law 8451 of the wise 2450 [is] a fountain 4726 of life, 2416 to depart 5493-2 from the snares 4170 of death. 4194

13:15 Good 2896 understanding 7922 giveth 5414-4 favour: 2580 but the way 1870 of transgressors 898-6 [is] hard. 386

13:16 Every prudent 6175 [man] dealeth 6213-4 with knowledge: 1847 but a fool 3684 layeth open 6566-4 [his] folly. 200

13:17 A wicked 7563 messenger 4397 falleth 5307-4 into mischief: 7451 but a faithful 529 ambassador 6735 [is] health. 4832

13:18 Poverty 7389 and shame 7036 [shall be to] him that refuseth 6544-6 instruction: 4148 but he that regardeth 8104-6 reproof 8433 shall be honoured. 3513-29

13:19 The desire 8378 accomplished 1961-8 is sweet 6149-4 to the soul: 5315 but [it is] abomination 8441 to fools 3684 to depart 5493-2 from evil. 7451

13:20 He that walketh 1980-6 with wise 2450 [men] shall be wise: 2449-4 but a companion 7462-6 of fools 3684 shall be destroyed. 7321-11

13:21 Evil 7451 pursueth 7291-17 sinners: 2400 but to the righteous 6662 good 2896 shall be repayed. 7999-17

13:22 A good 2896 [man] leaveth an inheritance 5157-55 to his children's 1121 children: 1121 and the wealth 2428 of the sinner 2398-6 [is] laid up 6845-7 for the just. 6662

13:23 Much 7230 food 400 [is in] the tillage 5215 of the poor: 7218|7326-6 but there is 3426 [that is] destroyed 5595-12 for want 3808 of judgment. 4941

13:24 He that spareth 2820-6 his rod 7626 hateth 8130-6 his son: 1121 but he that loveth 157-6 him chasteneth 4148 him betimes. 7836-14

13:25 The righteous 6662 eateth 398-6 to the satisfying 7648 of his soul: 5315 but the belly 990 of the wicked 7563 shall want. 2637-4

14:1 Every wise 2454 woman 802 buildeth 1129-1 her house: 1004 but the foolish 200 plucketh it down 2040-4 with her hands. 3027

14:2 He that walketh 1980-6 in his uprightness 3476 feareth 3373 the LORD: 3068 but [he that is] perverse 3868-12 in his ways 1870 despiseth 959-6 him.

14:3 In the mouth 6310 of the foolish 191 [is] a rod 2415 of pride: 1346 but the lips 8193 of the wise 2450 shall preserve 8104-4 them.

14:4 Where no oxen 504 [are], the crib 18 [is] clean: 1249 but much 7230 increase 8393 [is] by the strength 3581 of the ox. 7794

14:5 A faithful 529 witness 5707 will not lie: 3576-17 but a false 8267 witness 5707 will utter 6315-55 lies. 3577

14:6 A scorner 3887-5 seeketh 1245-14 wisdom, 2451 and [findeth it] not: but knowledge 1847 [is] easy 7043-8 unto him that understandeth. 995-12

14:7 Go 3212-3 from the presence 5048 of a foolish 3684 man, 376 when thou perceivest 3045-1 not [in him] the lips 8193 of knowledge. 1847

14:8 The wisdom 2451 of the prudent 6175 [is] to understand 995-53 his way: 1870 but the folly 200 of fools 3684 [is] deceit. 4820

14:9 Fools 191 make a mock 3887-55 at sin: 817 but among the righteous 3477 [there is] favour. 7522

14:10 The heart 3820 knoweth 3045-6 his own 5315 bitterness; 4787 and a stranger 2114-5 doth not intermeddle 6148-101 with his joy. 8057

14:11 The house 1004 of the wicked 7563 shall be overthrown: 8045-11 but the tabernacle 168 of the upright 3477 shall flourish. 6524-55

14:12 There is 3426 a way 1870 which seemeth right 3477 unto 6440 a man, 376 but the end thereof 319 [are] the ways 1870 of death. 4194

14:13 Even in laughter 7814 the heart 3820 is sorrowful; 3510-4 and the end 319 of that mirth 8057 [is] heaviness. 8424

14:14 The backslider 5472-7 in heart 3820 shall be filled 7646-4 with his own ways: 1870 and a good 2896 man 376 [shall be satisfied] from himself.

14:15 The simple 6612 believeth 539-55 every word: 1697 but the prudent 6175 [man] looketh well 995-4 to his going. 838

14:16 A wise 2450 [man] feareth, 3373 and departeth 5493-6 from evil: 7451 but the fool 3684 rageth, 5674-102 and is confident. 982-6

14:17 [He that is] soon 7116 angry 639 dealeth 6213-4 foolishly: 200 and a man 376 of wicked devices 4209 is hated. 8130-11

14:18 The simple 6612 inherit 5157-1 folly: 200 but the prudent 6175 are crowned 3803-55 with knowledge. 1847

14:19 The evil 7451 bow 7817-1 before 6440 the good; 2896 and the wicked 7563 at the gates 8179 of the righteous. 6662

14:20 The poor 7326-6 is hated 8130-11 even of his own neighbour: 7453 but the rich 6223 [hath] many 7227 friends. 157-6

14:21 He that despiseth 936-6 his neighbour 7453 sinneth: 2398-6 but he that hath mercy 2603-26 on the poor, 6035|6041-k happy 835 [is] he.

14:22 Do they not err 8582-4 that devise 2790-6 evil? 7451 but mercy 2617 and truth 571 [shall be] to them that devise 2790-6 good. 2896

14:23 In all labour 6089 there is profit: 4195 but the talk 1697 of the lips 8193 [tendeth] only to penury. 4270

14:24 The crown 5850 of the wise 2450 [is] their riches: 6239 [but] the foolishness 200 of fools 3684 [is] folly. 200

14:25 A true 571 witness 5707 delivereth 5337-56 souls: 5315 but a deceitful 4820 [witness] speaketh 6315-55 lies. 3577

14:26 In the fear 3374 of the LORD 3068 [is] strong 5797 confidence: 4009 and his children 1121 shall have a place of refuge. 4268

14:27 The fear 3374 of the LORD 3068 [is] a fountain 4726 of life, 2416 to depart 5493-2 from the snares 4170 of death. 4194

14:28 In the multitude 7230 of people 5971 [is] the king's 4428 honour: 1927 but in the want 657 of people 3816 [is] the destruction 4288 of the prince. 7333

14:29 [He that is] slow 750 to wrath 639 [is] of great 7227 understanding: 8394 but [he that is] hasty 7116 of spirit 7307 exalteth 7311-56 folly. 200

14:30 A sound 4832 heart 3820 [is] the life 2416 of the flesh: 1320 but envy 7068 the rottenness 7538 of the bones. 6106

14:31 He that oppresseth 6231-6 the poor 1800 reproacheth 2778-14 his Maker: 6213-6 but he that honoureth 3513-18 him hath mercy 2603-6 on the poor. 34

14:32 The wicked 7563 is driven away 1760-11 in his wickedness: 7451 but the righteous 6662 hath hope 2620-6 in his death. 4194

14:33 Wisdom 2451 resteth 5117-4 in the heart 3820 of him that hath understanding: 995-12 but [that which is] in the midst 7130 of fools 3684 is made known. 3045-11

14:34 Righteousness 6666 exalteth 7311-34 a nation: 1471 but sin 2403 [is] a reproach 2617 to any people. 3816

14:35 The king's 4428 favour 7522 [is] toward a wise 7919-56 servant: 5650 but his wrath 5678 is [against] him that causeth shame. 954-56

15:1 A soft 7390 answer 4617 turneth 7725-55 away wrath: 2534 but grievous 6089 words 1697 stir up 5927-55 anger. 639

15:2 The tongue 3956 of the wise 2450 useth knowledge 1847 aright: 3190-55 but the mouth 6310 of fools 3684 poureth out 5042-55 foolishness. 200

15:3 The eyes 5869 of the LORD 3068 [are] in every place, 4725 beholding 6822-6 the evil 7451 and the good. 2896

15:4 A wholesome 4832 tongue 3956 [is] a tree 6086 of life: 2416 but perverseness 5558 therein [is] a breach 7667 in the spirit. 7307

15:5 A fool 191 despiseth 5006-4 his father's 1 instruction: 4148 but he that regardeth 8104-6 reproof 8433 is prudent. 6191-55

15:6 In the house 1004 of the righteous 6662 [is] much 7227 treasure: 2633 but in the revenues 8393 of the wicked 7563 is trouble. 5916-12

15:7 The lips 8193 of the wise 2450 disperse 2219-17 knowledge: 1847 but the heart 3820 of the foolish 3684 [doeth] not so.

15:8 The sacrifice 2077 of the wicked 7563 [is] an abomination 8441 to the LORD: 3068 but the prayer 8605 of the upright 3477 [is] his delight. 7522

15:9 The way 1870 of the wicked 7563 [is] an abomination 8441 unto the LORD: 3068 but he loveth 157-4 him that followeth 7291-18 after righteousness. 6666

15:10 Correction 4148 [is] grievous 7451 unto him that forsaketh 5800-6 the way: 734 [and] he that hateth 8130-6 reproof 8433 shall die. 4191-4

15:11 Hell 7585 and destruction 11 [are] before the LORD: 3068 how much more then the hearts 3826 of the children 1121 of men? 120

15:12 A scorner 3887-5 loveth 157-4 not one that reproveth 3198-53 him: neither will he go 3212-4 unto the wise. 2450

15:13 A merry 8056 heart 3820 maketh a cheerful 3190-55 countenance: 6440 but by sorrow 6094 of the heart 3820 the spirit 7307 is broken. 5218

15:14 The heart 3820 of him that hath understanding 995-12 seeketh 1245-17 knowledge: 1847 but the mouth 6310|6440-k of fools 3684 feedeth 7462-4 on foolishness. 200

15:15 All the days 3117 of the afflicted 6041 [are] evil: 7451 but he that is of a merry 2896 heart 3820 [hath] a continual 8548 feast. 4960

15:16 Better 2896 [is] little 4592 with the fear 3374 of the LORD 3068 than great 7227 treasure 214 and trouble 4103 therewith.

15:17 Better 2896 [is] a dinner 737 of herbs 3419 where love 160 is, than a stalled 75-7 ox 7794 and hatred 8135 therewith.

15:18 A wrathful 2534 man 376 stirreth up 1624-17 strife: 4066 but [he that is] slow 750 to anger 639 appeaseth 8252-55 strife. 7379

15:19 The way 1870 of the slothful 6102 [man is] as an hedge 4881 of thorns: 2312 but the way 734 of the righteous 3477 [is] made plain. 5549-7

15:20 A wise 2450 son 1121 maketh a glad 8055-17 father: 1 but a foolish 3684 man 120 despiseth 959-6 his mother. 517

15:21 Folly 200 [is] joy 8057 to [him that is] destitute 2638 of wisdom: 3820 but a man 376 of understanding 8394 walketh 3212-2 uprightly. 3474-17

15:22 Without counsel 5475 purposes 4284 are disappointed: 6565-53 but in the multitude 7230 of counsellors 3289-6 they are established. 6965-4

15:23 A man 376 hath joy 8057 by the answer 4617 of his mouth: 6310 and a word 1697 [spoken] in due season, 6256 how good 2896 [is it]!

15:24 The way 734 of life 2416 [is] above 4605 to the wise, 7919-56 that he may depart 5493-2 from hell 7585 beneath. 4295

15:25 The LORD 3068 will destroy 5255-4 the house 1004 of the proud: 1343 but he will establish 5324-55 the border 1366 of the widow. 490

15:26 The thoughts 4284 of the wicked 7451 [are] an abomination 8441 to the LORD: 3068 but [the words] of the pure 2889 [are] pleasant 5278 words. 561

15:27 He that is greedy 1214-6 of gain 1215 troubleth 5916-6 his own house; 1004 but he that hateth 8130-6 gifts 4979 shall live. 2421-4

15:28 The heart 3820 of the righteous 6662 studieth 1897-4 to answer: 6030-2 but the mouth 6310 of the wicked 7563 poureth out 5042-55 evil things. 7451

15:29 The LORD 3068 [is] far 7350 from the wicked: 7563 but he heareth 8085-4 the prayer 8605 of the righteous. 6662

15:30 The light 3974 of the eyes 5869 rejoiceth 8055-17 the heart: 3820 [and] a good 2896 report 8052 maketh the bones 6106 fat. 1878-17

15:31 The ear 241 that heareth 8085-6 the reproof 8433 of life 2416 abideth 3885-4 among 7130 the wise. 2450

15:32 He that refuseth 6544-6 instruction 4148 despiseth 3988-6 his own soul: 5315 but he that heareth 8085-6 reproof 8433 getteth 7069-6 understanding. 3820

15:33 The fear 3374 of the LORD 3068 [is] the instruction 4148 of wisdom; 2451 and before 6440 honour 3519 [is] humility. 6038

16:1 The preparations 4633 of the heart 3820 in man, 120 and the answer 4617 of the tongue, 3956 [is] from the LORD. 3068

16:2 All the ways 1870 of a man 376 [are] clean 2134 in his own eyes; 5869 but the LORD 3068 weigheth 8505-6 the spirits. 7307

16:3 Commit 1556-3 thy works 4639 unto the LORD, 3068 and thy thoughts 4284 shall be established. 3559-11

16:4 The LORD 3068 hath made 6466-1 all [things] for himself: 4617 yea, even the wicked 7563 for the day 3117 of evil. 7451

16:5 Every one [that is] proud 1362 in heart 3820 [is] an abomination 8441 to the LORD: 3068 [though] hand 3027 [join] in hand, 3027 he shall not be unpunished. 5352-11

16:6 By mercy 2617 and truth 571 iniquity 5771 is purged: 3722-29 and by the fear 3374 of the LORD 3068 [men] depart 5493-2 from evil. 7451

16:7 When a man's 376 ways 1870 please 7521-2 the LORD, 3068 he maketh even his enemies 341-6 to be at peace 7999-55 with him.

16:8 Better 2896 [is] a little 4592 with righteousness 6666 than great 7230 revenues 8393 without right. 4941

16:9 A man's 120 heart 3820 deviseth 2803-17 his way: 1870 but the LORD 3068 directeth 3559-55 his steps. 6806

16:10 A divine sentence 7081 [is] in the lips 8193 of the king: 4428 his mouth 6310 transgresseth 4603-4 not in judgment. 4941

16:11 A just 4941 weight 6425 and balance 3976 [are] the LORD'S: 3068 all the weights 68 of the bag 3599 [are] his work. 4639

16:12 [It is] an abomination 8441 to kings 4428 to commit 6213-2 wickedness: 7562 for the throne 3678 is established 3559-11 by righteousness.6666 

16:13 Righteous 6664 lips 8193 [are] the delight 7522 of kings; 4428 and they love 157-4 him that speaketh 1696-6 right. 3477

16:14 The wrath 2534 of a king 4428 [is as] messengers 4397 of death: 4194 but a wise 2450 man 376 will pacify 3722-17 it.

16:15 In the light 216 of the king's 4428 countenance 6440 [is] life; 2416 and his favour 7522 [is] as a cloud 5645 of the latter rain. 4456

16:16 How much better 2896 [is it] to get 7069-2 wisdom 2451 than gold! 2742 and to get 7069-2 understanding 998 rather to be chosen 977-12 than silver! 3701

16:17 The highway 4546 of the upright 3477 [is] to depart 5493-2 from evil: 7451 he that keepeth 5341-6 his way 1870 preserveth 8104-6 his soul. 5315

16:18 Pride 1347 [goeth] before 6440 destruction, 7667 and an haughty 1363 spirit 7307 before 6440 a fall. 3783

16:19 Better 2896 [it is to be] of an humble 8217 spirit 7307 with the lowly, 6035|6041-k than to divide 2505-15 the spoil 7998 with the proud. 1343

16:20 He that handleth a matter 1697 wisely 7919-56 shall find 4672-4 good: 2896 and whoso trusteth 982-6 in the LORD, 3068 happy 835 [is] he.

16:21 The wise 2450 in heart 3820 shall be called 7121-11 prudent: 995-12 and the sweetness 4986 of the lips 8193 increaseth 3254-55 learning. 3948

16:22 Understanding 7922 [is] a wellspring 4726 of life 2416 unto him that hath 1167 it: but the instruction 4148 of fools 191 [is] folly. 200

16:23 The heart 3820 of the wise 2450 teacheth 7919-55 his mouth, 6310 and addeth 3254-55 learning 3948 to his lips. 8193

16:24 Pleasant 5278 words 561 [are as] an honeycomb, 6688 1706 sweet 4966 to the soul, 5315 and health 4832 to the bones. 6106

16:25 There is 3426 a way 1870 that seemeth right 3477 unto 6440 a man, 376 but the end thereof 319 [are] the ways 1870 of death. 4194

16:26 He 5315 that laboureth 6001 laboureth 5998-1 for himself; for his mouth 6310 craveth 404-1 it of him.

16:27 An ungodly 1100 man 376 diggeth 3738-6 up evil: 7451 and in his lips 8193 [there is] as a burning 6867 fire. 784

16:28 A froward 8419 man 376 soweth 7971-17 strife: 4066 and a whisperer 5372 separateth 6504-56 chief friends. 441

16:29 A violent 2555 man 376 enticeth 6601-17 his neighbour, 7453 and leadeth 3212-52 him into the way 1870 [that is] not good. 2896

16:30 He shutteth 6095-6 his eyes 5869 to devise 2803-2 froward things: 8419 moving 7169-6 his lips 8193 he bringeth evil 7451 to pass. 3615-14

16:31 The hoary head 7872 [is] a crown 5850 of glory, 8597 [if] it be found 4672-11 in the way 1870 of righteousness. 6666

16:32 [He that is] slow 750 to anger 639 [is] better 2896 than the mighty; 1368 and he that ruleth 4910-6 his spirit 7307 than he that taketh 3920-6 a city. 5892

16:33 The lot 1486 is cast 2904-93 into the lap; 2436 but the whole disposing 4941 thereof [is] of the LORD. 3068

17:1 Better 2896 [is] a dry 2720 morsel, 6595 and quietness 7962 therewith, than an house 1004 full 4392 of sacrifices 2077 [with] strife. 7379

17:2 A wise 7919-56 servant 5650 shall have rule 4910-4 over a son 1121 that causeth shame, 954-56 and shall have part 2505-4 of the inheritance 5159 among 8432 the brethren. 251

17:3 The fining pot 4715 [is] for silver, 3701 and the furnace 3564 for gold: 2091 but the LORD 3068 trieth 974-6 the hearts. 3826

17:4 A wicked doer 7489-56 giveth heed 7181-56 to false 205 lips; 8193 [and] a liar 8267 giveth ear 238-56 to a naughty 1942 tongue. 3956

17:5 Whoso mocketh 3932-6 the poor 7326-6 reproacheth 2778-14 his Maker: 6213-6 [and] he that is glad 8056 at calamities 343 shall not be unpunished. 5352-11

17:6 Children's 1121 children 1121 [are] the crown 5850 of old men; 2205 and the glory 8597 of children 1121 [are] their fathers. 1

17:7 Excellent 3499 speech 8193 becometh 5000 not a fool: 5036 much less do lying 8267 lips 8193 a prince. 5081

17:8 A gift 7810 [is as] a precious 2580 stone 68 in the eyes 5869 of him that hath 1167 it: whithersoever it turneth, 6437-4 it prospereth. 7919-55

17:9 He that covereth 3680-18 a transgression 6588 seeketh 1245-18 love; 160 but he that repeateth 8138-6 a matter 1697 separateth 6504-56 [very] friends. 441

17:10 A reproof 1606 entereth 5181-4 more into a wise man 995-56 than an hundred 3967 stripes 5221-53 into a fool. 3684

17:11 An evil 7451 [man] seeketh 1245-17 only rebellion: 4805 therefore a cruel 394 messenger 4397 shall be sent 7971-29 against him.

17:12 Let a bear 1677 robbed 7909 of her whelps meet 6298-2 a man, 376 rather than 408 a fool 3684 in his folly. 200

17:13 Whoso rewardeth 7725-56 evil 7451 for good, 2896 evil 7451 shall not depart 4185-4|4185-55-k from his house. 1004

17:14 The beginning 7225 of strife 4066 [is as] when one letteth out 6362-6 water: 4325 therefore leave off 5203-2 contention, 7379 before 6440 it be meddled 1566-98 with.

17:15 He that justifieth 6663-56 the wicked, 7563 and he that condemneth 7561-56 the just, 6662 even they both 8147 [are] abomination 8441 to the LORD. 3068

17:16 Wherefore [is there] a price 4242 in the hand 3027 of a fool 3684 to get 7069-2 wisdom, 2451 seeing [he hath] no heart 3820 [to it]?

17:17 A friend 7453 loveth 157-6 at all times, 6256 and a brother 251 is born 3205-11 for adversity. 6869

17:18 A man 120 void 2638 of understanding 3820 striketh 8628-6 hands, 3709 [and] becometh 6148-6 surety 6161 in the presence 6440 of his friend. 7453

17:19 He loveth 157-6 transgression 6588 that loveth 157-6 strife: 4683 [and] he that exalteth 1361-56 his gate 6607 seeketh 1245-18 destruction. 7667

17:20 He that hath a froward 6141 heart 3820 findeth 4672-4 no good: 2896 and he that hath a perverse 2015-8 tongue 3956 falleth 5307-4 into mischief. 7451

17:21 He that begetteth 3205-6 a fool 3684 [doeth it] to his sorrow: 8424 and the father 1 of a fool 5036 hath no joy. 8055-4

17:22 A merry 8056 heart 3820 doeth good 3190-55 [like] a medicine: 1456 but a broken 5218 spirit 7307 drieth 3001-17 the bones. 1634

17:23 A wicked 7563 [man] taketh 3947-4 a gift 7810 out of the bosom 2436 to pervert 5186-53 the ways 734 of judgment. 4941

17:24 Wisdom 2451 [is] before 6440 him that hath understanding; 995-56 but the eyes 5869 of a fool 3684 [are] in the ends 7097 of the earth. 776

17:25 A foolish 3684 son 1121 [is] a grief 3708 to his father, 1 and bitterness 4470 to her that bare 3205-6 him.

17:26 Also to punish 6064-2 the just 6662 [is] not good, 2896 [nor] to strike 5221-53 princes 5081 for equity. 3476

17:27 He that hath 3045-6 knowledge 1847 spareth 2820-6 his words: 561 [and] a man 376 of understanding 8394 is of an excellent 3368|7119-k spirit. 7307

17:28 Even a fool, 191 when he holdeth his peace, 2790-56 is counted 2803-11 wise: 2450 [and] he that shutteth 331-5 his lips 8193 [is esteemed] a man of understanding. 995-12

18:1 Through desire 8378 a man, having separated 6504-12 himself, seeketh 1245-17 [and] intermeddleth 1566-101 with all wisdom. 8454

18:2 A fool 3684 hath no delight 2654-4 in understanding, 8394 but that his heart 3820 may discover 1540-99 itself.

18:3 When the wicked 7563 cometh, 935-2 [then] cometh 935-1 also contempt, 937 and with ignominy 7036 reproach. 2781

18:4 The words 1697 of a man's 376 mouth 6310 [are as] deep 6013 waters, 4325 [and] the wellspring 4726 of wisdom 2451 [as] a flowing 5042-6 brook. 5158

18:5 [It is] not good 2896 to accept 5375-2 the person 6440 of the wicked, 7563 to overthrow 5186-53 the righteous 6662 in judgment. 4941

18:6 A fool's 3684 lips 8193 enter 935-4 into contention, 7379 and his mouth 6310 calleth 7121-4 for strokes. 4112

18:7 A fool's 3684 mouth 6310 [is] his destruction, 4288 and his lips 8193 [are] the snare 4170 of his soul. 5315

18:8 The words 1697 of a talebearer 5372 [are] as wounds, 3859-102 and they go down 3381-1 into the innermost parts 2315 of the belly. 990

18:9 He also that is slothful 7503-102 in his work 4399 is brother 251 to him that is a great 1167 waster. 7843-56

18:10 The name 8034 of the LORD 3068 [is] a strong 5797 tower: 4026 the righteous 6662 runneth 7323-4 into it, and is safe. 7682-8

18:11 The rich 6223 man's wealth 1952 [is] his strong 5797 city, 7151 and as an high 7682-12 wall 2346 in his own conceit. 4906

18:12 Before 6440 destruction 7667 the heart 3820 of man 376 is haughty, 1361-4 and before 6440 honour 3519 [is] humility. 6038

18:13 He that answereth 7725-56 a matter 1697 before he heareth 8085-4 [it], it [is] folly 200 and shame 3639 unto him.

18:14 The spirit 7307 of a man 376 will sustain 3557-46 his infirmity; 4245 but a wounded 5218 spirit 7307 who can bear? 5375-4

18:15 The heart 3820 of the prudent 995-12 getteth 7069-4 knowledge; 1847 and the ear 241 of the wise 2450 seeketh 1245-17 knowledge. 1847

18:16 A man's 120 gift 4976 maketh room 7337-55 for him, and bringeth 5148-55 him before 6440 great men. 1419

18:17 [He that is] first 7223 in his own cause 7379 [seemeth] just; 6662 but his neighbour 7453 cometh 935-1|935-4-k and searcheth 2713-1 him.

18:18 The lot 1486 causeth contentions 4079 to cease, 7673-55 and parteth 6504-55 between the mighty. 6099

18:19 A brother 251 offended 6586-12 [is harder to be won] than a strong 5797 city: 7151 and [their] contentions 4079|4066-k [are] like the bars 1280 of a castle. 759

18:20 A man's 376 belly 990 shall be satisfied 7646-4 with the fruit 6529 of his mouth; 6310 [and] with the increase 8393 of his lips 8193 shall he be filled. 7646-4

18:21 Death 4194 and life 2416 [are] in the power 3027 of the tongue: 3956 and they that love 157-6 it shall eat 398-4 the fruit 6529 thereof.

18:22 [Whoso] findeth 4672-1 a wife 802 findeth 4672-1 a good 2896 [thing], and obtaineth 6329-55 favour 7522 of the LORD. 3068

18:23 The poor 7326-6 useth 1696-17 intreaties; 8469 but the rich 6223 answereth 6030-4 roughly. 5794

18:24 A man 376 [that hath] friends 7453 must shew himself friendly: 7489-111 and there is 3426 a friend 157-6 [that] sticketh closer 1695 than a brother. 251

19:1 Better 2896 [is] the poor 7326-6 that walketh 1980-6 in his integrity, 8537 than [he that is] perverse 6141 in his lips, 8193 and is a fool. 3684

19:2 Also, [that] the soul 5315 [be] without knowledge, 1847 [it is] not good; 2896 and he that hasteth 213-5 with [his] feet 7272 sinneth. 2398-6

19:3 The foolishness 200 of man 120 perverteth 5557-17 his way: 1870 and his heart 3820 fretteth 2196-4 against the LORD. 3068

19:4 Wealth 1952 maketh 3254-55 many 7227 friends; 7453 but the poor 1800 is separated 6504-11 from his neighbour. 7453

19:5 A false 8267 witness 5707 shall not be unpunished, 5352-11 and [he that] speaketh 6315-55 lies 3577 shall not escape. 4422-11

19:6 Many 7227 will intreat 2470-17 the favour 6440 of the prince: 5081 and every man [is] a friend 7453 to him 376 that giveth gifts. 4976

19:7 All the brethren 251 of the poor 7326-6 do hate 8130-1 him: how much more do his friends 4828 go far 7368-1 from him? he pursueth 7291-18 [them with] words, 561 [yet] they [are] wanting [to him].

19:8 He that getteth 7069-6 wisdom 3820 loveth 157-6 his own soul: 5315 he that keepeth 8104-6 understanding 8394 shall find 4672-2 good. 2896

19:9 A false 8267 witness 5707 shall not be unpunished, 5352-11 and [he that] speaketh 6315-55 lies 3577 shall perish. 6-4

19:10 Delight 8588 is not seemly 5000 for a fool; 3684 much less for a servant 5650 to have rule 4910-2 over princes. 8269

19:11 The discretion 7922 of a man 120 deferreth 748-52 his anger; 639 and [it is] his glory 8597 to pass 5674-2 over a transgression. 6588

19:12 The king's 4428 wrath 2197 [is] as the roaring 5099 of a lion; 3715 but his favour 7522 [is] as dew 2919 upon the grass. 6212

19:13 A foolish 3684 son 1121 [is] the calamity 1942 of his father: 1 and the contentions 4079 of a wife 802 [are] a continual 2956-6 dropping. 1812

19:14 House 1004 and riches 1952 [are] the inheritance 5159 of fathers: 1 and a prudent 7919-56 wife 802 [is] from the LORD. 3068

19:15 Slothfulness 6103 casteth 5307-55 into a deep sleep; 8639 and an idle 7423 soul 5315 shall suffer hunger. 7456-4

19:16 He that keepeth 8104-6 the commandment 4687 keepeth 8104-6 his own soul; 5315 [but] he that despiseth 959-6 his ways 1870 shall die. 4191-4

19:17 He that hath pity 2603-6 upon the poor 1800 lendeth 3867-56 unto the LORD; 3068 and that which he hath given 1576 will he pay 7999-17 him again.

19:18 Chasten 3256-16 thy son 1121 while there is 3426 hope, 8615 and let not thy soul 5315 spare 5375-4 for his crying. 4191-53

19:19 A man of great 1419|1632-k wrath 2534 shall suffer 5375-6 punishment: 6066 for if thou deliver 5337-55 [him], yet thou must do it again. 3254-55

19:20 Hear 8085-3 counsel, 6098 and receive 6901-16 instruction, 4148 that thou mayest be wise 2449-4 in thy latter end. 319

19:21 [There are] many 7227 devices 4284 in a man's 376 heart; 3820 nevertheless the counsel 6098 of the LORD, 3068 that shall stand. 6965-4

19:22 The desire 8378 of a man 120 [is] his kindness: 2617 and a poor 7326-6 man [is] better 2896 than 376 a liar. 3577

19:23 The fear 3374 of the LORD 3068 [tendeth] to life: 2416 and [he that hath it] shall abide 3885-4 satisfied; 7649 he shall not be visited 6485-11 with evil. 7451

19:24 A slothful 6102 [man] hideth 2934-1 his hand 3027 in [his] bosom, 6747 and will not so much as bring it to his mouth 6310 again. 7725-55

19:25 Smite 5221-55 a scorner, 3887-5 and the simple 6612 will beware: 6191-55 and reprove 3198-52 one that hath understanding, 995-12 [and] he will understand 995-4 knowledge. 1847

19:26 He that wasteth 7703-18 [his] father, 1 [and] chaseth away 1272-55 [his] mother, 517 [is] a son 1121 that causeth shame, 954-56 and bringeth reproach. 2659-56

19:27 Cease, 2308-3 my son, 1121 to hear 8085-2 the instruction 4148 [that causeth] to err 7686-2 from the words 561 of knowledge. 1847

19:28 An ungodly 1100 witness 5707 scorneth 3887-55 judgment: 4941 and the mouth 6310 of the wicked 7563 devoureth 1104-17 iniquity. 205

19:29 Judgments 8201 are prepared 3559-8 for scorners, 3887-5 and stripes 4112 for the back 1460 of fools. 3684

20:1 Wine 3196 [is] a mocker, 3887-5 strong drink 7941 [is] raging: 1993-6 and whosoever is deceived 7686-6 thereby is not wise. 2449-4

20:2 The fear 367 of a king 4428 [is] as the roaring 5099 of a lion: 3715 [whoso] provoketh him to anger 5674-102 sinneth 2398-6 [against] his own soul. 5315

20:3 [It is] an honour 3519 for a man 376 to cease 7674 from strife: 7379 but every fool 191 will be meddling. 1566-101

20:4 The sluggard 6102 will not plow 2790-4 by reason of the cold; 2779 [therefore] shall he beg 7592-1|7592-4-k in harvest, 7105 and [have] nothing.

20:5 Counsel 6098 in the heart 3820 of man 376 [is like] deep 6013 water; 4325 but a man 376 of understanding 8394 will draw it out. 1802-4

20:6 Most 7230 men 120 will proclaim 7121-4 every one 376 his own goodness: 2617 but a faithful 529 man 376 who can find? 4672-4

20:7 The just 6662 [man] walketh 1980-102 in his integrity: 8537 his children 1121 [are] blessed 835 after 310 him.

20:8 A king 4428 that sitteth 3427-6 in the throne 3678 of judgment 1779 scattereth away 2219-18 all evil 7451 with his eyes. 5869

20:9 Who can say, 559-4 I have made my heart 3820 clean, 2135-14 I am pure 2891-1 from my sin? 2403

20:10 Divers weights, 68 68 [and] divers measures, 374 374 both 8147 of them [are] alike 1571 abomination 8441 to the LORD. 3068

20:11 Even a child 5288 is known 5234-101 by his doings, 4611 whether his work 6467 [be] pure, 2134 and whether [it be] right. 3477

20:12 The hearing 8085-6 ear, 241 and the seeing 7200-6 eye, 5869 the LORD 3068 hath made 6213-1 even both 8147 of them.

20:13 Love 157-4 not sleep, 8142 lest thou come to poverty; 3423-11 open 6491-3 thine eyes, 5869 [and] thou shalt be satisfied 7646-3 with bread. 3899

20:14 [It is] naught, 7451 [it is] naught, 7451 saith 559-4 the buyer: 7069-6 but when he is gone 235-5 his way, then he boasteth. 1984-101

20:15 There is 3426 gold, 2091 and a multitude 7230 of rubies: 6443 but the lips 8193 of knowledge 1847 [are] a precious 3366 jewel. 3627

20:16 Take 3947-3 his garment 899 that is surety 6148-1 [for] a stranger: 2114-5 and take a pledge 2254-3 of him for a strange 5237 woman.

20:17 Bread 3899 of deceit 8267 [is] sweet 6156 to a man; 376 but afterwards 310 his mouth 6310 shall be filled 4390-11 with gravel. 2687

20:18 [Every] purpose 4284 is established 3559-11 by counsel: 6098 and with good advice 8458 make 6213-3 war. 4421

20:19 He that goeth about 1980-6 [as] a talebearer 7400 revealeth 1540-6 secrets: 5475 therefore meddle 6148-101 not with him that flattereth 6601-6 with his lips. 8193

20:20 Whoso curseth 7043-18 his father 1 or his mother, 517 his lamp 5216 shall be put out 1846-4 in obscure 380|380-q darkness. 2822

20:21 An inheritance 5159 [may be] gotten hastily 926-30|973-30-k at the beginning; 7223 but the end thereof 319 shall not be blessed. 1288-29

20:22 Say 559-4 not thou, I will recompense 7999-17 evil; 7451 [but] wait 6960-16 on the LORD, 3068 and he shall save 3467-55 thee.

20:23 Divers weights 68 68 [are] an abomination 8441 unto the LORD; 3068 and a false 4820 balance 3976 [is] not good. 2896

20:24 Man's 1397 goings 4703 [are] of the LORD; 3068 how can a man 120 then understand 995-4 his own way? 1870

20:25 [It is] a snare 4170 to the man 120 [who] devoureth 3216-1 [that which is] holy, 6944 and after 310 vows 5088 to make enquiry. 1239-15

20:26 A wise 2450 king 4428 scattereth 2219-18 the wicked, 7563 and bringeth 7725-55 the wheel 212 over them.

20:27 The spirit 5397 of man 120 [is] the candle 5216 of the LORD, 3068 searching 2664-6 all the inward parts 2315 of the belly. 990

20:28 Mercy 2617 and truth 571 preserve 5341-4 the king: 4428 and his throne 3678 is upholden 5582-1 by mercy. 2617

20:29 The glory 8597 of young men 970 [is] their strength: 3581 and the beauty 1926 of old men 2205 [is] the gray head. 7872

20:30 The blueness 2250 of a wound 6482 cleanseth 8562 away evil: 7451 so [do] stripes 4347 the inward parts 2315 of the belly. 990

21:1 The king's 4428 heart 3820 [is] in the hand 3027 of the LORD, 3068 [as] the rivers 6388 of water: 4325 he turneth 5186-55 it whithersoever he will. 2654-4

21:2 Every way 1870 of a man 376 [is] right 3477 in his own eyes: 5869 but the LORD 3068 pondereth 8505-6 the hearts. 3826

21:3 To do 6213-2 justice 6666 and judgment 4941 [is] more acceptable 977-12 to the LORD 3068 than sacrifice. 2077

21:4 An high 7312 look, 5869 and a proud 7342 heart, 3820 [and] the plowing 5215 of the wicked, 7563 [is] sin. 2403

21:5 The thoughts 4284 of the diligent 2742 [tend] only to plenteousness; 4195 but of every one [that is] hasty 213-5 only to want. 4270

21:6 The getting 6467 of treasures 214 by a lying 8267 tongue 3956 [is] a vanity 1892 tossed to and fro 5086-12 of them that seek 1245-18 death. 4194

21:7 The robbery 7701 of the wicked 7563 shall destroy 1641-4 them; because they refuse 3985-14 to do 6213-2 judgment. 4941

21:8 The way 1870 of man 376 [is] froward 2019 and strange: 2054 but [as for] the pure, 2134 his work 6467 [is] right. 3477

21:9 [It is] better 2896 to dwell 3427-2 in a corner 6438 of the housetop, 1406 than with a brawling 4079|4066-k woman 802 in a wide 2267 house. 1004

21:10 The soul 5315 of the wicked 7563 desireth 183-14 evil: 7451 his neighbour 7453 findeth no favour 2603-90 in his eyes. 5869

21:11 When the scorner 3887-5 is punished, 6064-2 the simple 6612 is made wise: 2449-4 and when the wise 2450 is instructed, 7919-53 he receiveth 3947-4 knowledge. 1847

21:12 The righteous 6662 [man] wisely considereth 7919-56 the house 1004 of the wicked: 7563 [but God] overthroweth 5557-18 the wicked 7563 for [their] wickedness. 7451

21:13 Whoso stoppeth 331-5 his ears 241 at the cry 2201 of the poor, 1800 he also shall cry 7121-4 himself, but shall not be heard. 6030-11

21:14 A gift 4976 in secret 5643 pacifieth 3711-4 anger: 639 and a reward 7810 in the bosom 2436 strong 5794 wrath. 2534

21:15 [It is] joy 8057 to the just 6662 to do 6213-2 judgment: 4941 but destruction 4288 [shall be] to the workers 6466-6 of iniquity. 205

21:16 The man 120 that wandereth 8582-6 out of the way 1870 of understanding 7919-53 shall remain 5117-4 in the congregation 6951 of the dead. 7496

21:17 He that loveth 157-6 pleasure 8057 [shall be] a poor 4270 man: 376 he that loveth 157-6 wine 3196 and oil 8081 shall not be rich. 6238-55

21:18 The wicked 7563 [shall be] a ransom 3724 for the righteous, 6662 and the transgressor 898-6 for the upright. 3477

21:19 [It is] better 2896 to dwell 3427-2 in the wilderness, 776 4057 than with a contentious 4079|4066-k and an angry 3708 woman. 802

21:20 [There is] treasure 214 to be desired 2530-12 and oil 8081 in the dwelling 5116 of the wise; 2450 but a foolish 3684 man 120 spendeth it up. 1104-17

21:21 He that followeth 7291-6 after righteousness 6666 and mercy 2617 findeth 4672-4 life, 2416 righteousness, 6666 and honour. 3519

21:22 A wise 2450 [man] scaleth 5927-1 the city 5892 of the mighty, 1368 and casteth down 3381-55 the strength 5797 of the confidence 4009 thereof.

21:23 Whoso keepeth 8104-6 his mouth 6310 and his tongue 3956 keepeth 8104-6 his soul 5315 from troubles. 6869

21:24 Proud 2086 [and] haughty 3093 scorner 3887-5 [is] his name, 8034 who dealeth 6213-6 in proud 2087 wrath. 5678

21:25 The desire 8378 of the slothful 6102 killeth 4191-55 him; for his hands 3027 refuse 3985-14 to labour. 6213-2

21:26 He coveteth 183-98 greedily 8378 all the day 3117 long: but the righteous 6662 giveth 5414-4 and spareth 2820-4 not.

21:27 The sacrifice 2077 of the wicked 7563 [is] abomination: 8441 how much more, [when] he bringeth 935-55 it with a wicked mind? 2154

21:28 A false 3577 witness 5707 shall perish: 6-4 but the man 376 that heareth 8085-6 speaketh 1696-17 constantly. 5331

21:29 A wicked 7563 man 376 hardeneth 5810-52 his face: 6440 but [as for] the upright, 3477 he directeth 995-4|3559-55-k his way. 1870

21:30 [There is] no wisdom 2451 nor understanding 8394 nor counsel 6098 against the LORD. 3068

21:31 The horse 5483 [is] prepared 3559-94 against the day 3117 of battle: 4421 but safety 8668 [is] of the LORD. 3068

22:1 A [good] name 8034 [is] rather to be chosen 977-12 than great 7227 riches, 6239 [and] loving 2896 favour 2580 rather than silver 3701 and gold. 2091

22:2 The rich 6223 and poor 7326-6 meet 6298-8 together: the LORD 3068 [is] the maker 6213-6 of them all.

22:3 A prudent 6175 [man] foreseeth 7200-1 the evil, 7451 and hideth 5641-8|5641-4-k himself: but the simple 6612 pass on, 5674-1 and are punished. 6064-8

22:4 By 6118 humility 6038 [and] the fear 3374 of the LORD 3068 [are] riches, 6239 and honour, 3519 and life. 2416

22:5 Thorns 6791 [and] snares 6341 [are] in the way 1870 of the froward: 6141 he that doth keep 8104-6 his soul 5315 shall be far 7368-4 from them.

22:6 Train up 2596-3 a child 5288 in 6310 the way 1870 he should go: and when he is old, 2204-55 he will not depart 5493-4 from it.

22:7 The rich 6223 ruleth 4910-4 over the poor, 7326-6 and the borrower 3867-5 [is] servant 5650 to the 376 lender. 3867-56

22:8 He that soweth 2232-6 iniquity 5766 shall reap 7114-4 vanity: 205 and the rod 7626 of his anger 5678 shall fail. 3615-4

22:9 He that hath a bountiful 2896 eye 5869 shall be blessed; 1288-29 for he giveth 5414-1 of his bread 3899 to the poor. 1800

22:10 Cast out 1644-15 the scorner, 3887-5 and contention 4066 shall go out; 3318-4 yea, strife 1779 and reproach 7036 shall cease. 7673-4

22:11 He that loveth 157-6 pureness 2890|2889-k of heart, 3820 [for] the grace 2580 of his lips 8193 the king 4428 [shall be] his friend. 7453

22:12 The eyes 5869 of the LORD 3068 preserve 5341-1 knowledge, 1847 and he overthroweth 5557-17 the words 1697 of the transgressor. 898-6

22:13 The slothful 6102 [man] saith, 559-1 [There is] a lion 738 without, 2351 I shall be slain 7523-11 in 8432 the streets. 7339

22:14 The mouth 6310 of strange women 2114-5 [is] a deep 6013 pit: 7745 he that is abhorred 2194-7 of the LORD 3068 shall fall 5307-4 therein.

22:15 Foolishness 200 [is] bound 7194-7 in the heart 3820 of a child; 5288 [but] the rod 7626 of correction 4148 shall drive it far 7368-55 from him.

22:16 He that oppresseth 6231-6 the poor 1800 to increase 7235-53 his [riches, and] he that giveth 5414-6 to the rich, 6223 [shall] surely [come] to want. 4270

22:17 Bow down 5186-54 thine ear, 241 and hear 8085-3 the words 1697 of the wise, 2450 and apply 7896-4 thine heart 3820 unto my knowledge. 1847

22:18 For [it is] a pleasant thing 5273 if thou keep 8104-4 them within 990 thee; they shall withal 3162 be fitted 3559-11 in thy lips. 8193

22:19 That thy trust 4009 may be in the LORD, 3068 I have made known 3045-52 to thee this day, 3117 even to thee.

22:20 Have not I written 3789-1 to thee excellent things 7991|8032-k in counsels 4156 and knowledge, 1847

22:21 That I might make thee know 3045-53 the certainty 7189 of the words 561 of truth; 571 that thou mightest answer 7725-53 the words 561 of truth 571 to them that send 7971-6 unto thee?

22:22 Rob 1497-4 not the poor, 1800 because he [is] poor: 1800 neither oppress 1792-17 the afflicted 6041 in the gate: 8179

22:23 For the LORD 3068 will plead 7378-4 their cause, 7379 and spoil 6906-1 the soul 5315 of those that spoiled 6906-6 them.

22:24 Make no friendship 7462-101 with an angry 639 man; 1167 and with a furious 2534 man 376 thou shalt not go: 935-4

22:25 Lest thou learn 502-4 his ways, 734 and get 3947-1 a snare 4170 to thy soul. 5315

22:26 Be not thou [one] of them that strike 8628-6 hands, 3709 [or] of them that are sureties 6148-6 for debts. 4859

22:27 If thou hast nothing to pay, 7999-15 why should he take away 3947-4 thy bed 4904 from under thee?

22:28 Remove 5253-55 not the ancient 5769 landmark, 1366 which thy fathers 1 have set. 6213-1

22:29 Seest 2372-1 thou a man 376 diligent 4106 in his business? 4399 he shall stand 3320-101 before 6440 kings; 4428 he shall not stand 3320-101 before 6440 mean 2823 [men].

23:1 When thou sittest 3427-4 to eat 3898-2 with a ruler, 4910-6 consider 995-4 diligently 995-2 what [is] before 6440 thee:

23:2 And put 7760-1 a knife 7915 to thy throat, 3930 if thou [be] a man given 1167 to appetite. 5315

23:3 Be not desirous 183-101 of his dainties: 4303 for they [are] deceitful 3577 meat. 3899

23:4 Labour 3021-4 not to be rich: 6238-53 cease 2308-3 from thine own wisdom. 998

23:5 Wilt thou set 5774-55|5774-4-k thine eyes 5869 upon that which is not? for [riches] certainly 6213-2 make 6213-4 themselves wings; 3671 they fly away 5774-4|5774-53-k as an eagle 5404 toward heaven. 8064

23:6 Eat 3898-4 thou not the bread 3899 of [him that hath] an evil 7451 eye, 5869 neither desire 183-101 thou his dainty meats: 4303

23:7 For as he thinketh 8176-1 in his heart, 5315 so [is] he: Eat 398-3 and drink, 8354-3 saith 559-4 he to thee; but his heart 3820 [is] not with thee.

23:8 The morsel 6595 [which] thou hast eaten 398-1 shalt thou vomit up, 6958-55 and lose 7843-14 thy sweet 5273 words. 1697

23:9 Speak 1696-17 not in the ears 241 of a fool: 3684 for he will despise 936-4 the wisdom 7922 of thy words. 4405

23:10 Remove 5253-55 not the old 5769 landmark; 1366 and enter 935-4 not into the fields 7704 of the fatherless: 3490

23:11 For their redeemer 1350-6 [is] mighty; 2389 he shall plead 7378-4 their cause 7379 with thee.

23:12 Apply 935-54 thine heart 3820 unto instruction, 4148 and thine ears 241 to the words 561 of knowledge. 1847

23:13 Withhold 4513-4 not correction 4148 from the child: 5288 for [if] thou beatest 5221-55 him with the rod, 7626 he shall not die. 4191-4

23:14 Thou shalt beat 5221-55 him with the rod, 7626 and shalt deliver 5337-55 his soul 5315 from hell. 7585

23:15 My son, 1121 if thine heart 3820 be wise, 2449-1 my heart 3820 shall rejoice, 8055-4 even mine. 589

23:16 Yea, my reins 3629 shall rejoice, 5937-4 when thy lips 8193 speak 1696-15 right things. 4339

23:17 Let not thine heart 3820 envy 7065-17 sinners: 2400 but [be thou] in the fear 3374 of the LORD 3068 all the day 3117 long.

23:18 For surely there is 3426 an end; 319 and thine expectation 8615 shall not be cut off. 3772-11

23:19 Hear 8085-3 thou, my son, 1121 and be wise, 2449-3 and guide 833-16 thine heart 3820 in the way. 1870

23:20 Be not among winebibbers; 3196 5433-6 among riotous eaters 2151-6 of flesh: 1320

23:21 For the drunkard 5433-6 and the glutton 2151-6 shall come to poverty: 3423-11 and drowsiness 5124 shall clothe 3847-55 [a man] with rags. 7168

23:22 Hearken 8085-3 unto thy father 1 that begat 3205-1 thee, and despise 936-4 not thy mother 517 when she is old. 2204-1

23:23 Buy 7069-3 the truth, 571 and sell 4376-4 [it] not; [also] wisdom, 2451 and instruction, 4148 and understanding. 998

23:24 The father 1 of the righteous 6662 shall greatly 1524 rejoice: 1523-4 and he that begetteth 3205-6 a wise 2450 [child] shall have joy 8055-4 of him.

23:25 Thy father 1 and thy mother 517 shall be glad, 8055-4 and she that bare 3205-6 thee shall rejoice. 1523-4

23:26 My son, 1121 give 5414-3 me thine heart, 3820 and let thine eyes 5869 observe 7521-4 5341-4 my ways. 1870

23:27 For a whore 2181-6 [is] a deep 6013 ditch; 7745 and a strange 5237 woman [is] a narrow 6862 pit. 875

23:28 She also lieth in wait 693-4 as [for] a prey, 2863 and increaseth 3254-55 the transgressors 898-6 among men. 120

23:29 Who hath woe? 188 who hath sorrow? 17 who hath contentions? 4079|4066-k who hath babbling? 7879 who hath wounds 6482 without cause? 2600 who hath redness 2448 of eyes? 5869

23:30 They that tarry long 309-18 at the wine; 3196 they that go 935-6 to seek 2713-2 mixed wine. 4469

23:31 Look 7200-4 not thou upon the wine 3196 when it is red, 119-101 when it giveth 5414-4 his colour 5869 in the cup, 3563|3599-k [when] it moveth 1980-101 itself aright. 4339

23:32 At the last 319 it biteth 5391-4 like a serpent, 5175 and stingeth 6567-55 like an adder. 6848

23:33 Thine eyes 5869 shall behold 7200-4 strange women, 2114-5 and thine heart 3820 shall utter 1696-17 perverse things. 8419

23:34 Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down 7901-6 in the midst 3820 of the sea, 3220 or as he that lieth 7901-6 upon the top 7218 of a mast. 2260

23:35 They have stricken 5221-52 me, [shalt thou say, and] I was not sick; 2470-1 they have beaten 1986-1 me, [and] I felt 3045-1 [it] not: when shall I awake? 6974-55 I will seek 1245-17 it yet 3254-55 again.

24:1 Be not thou envious 7065-17 against evil 7451 men, 582 neither desire 183-101 to be with them.

24:2 For their heart 3820 studieth 1897-4 destruction, 7701 and their lips 8193 talk 1696-17 of mischief. 5999

24:3 Through wisdom 2451 is an house 1004 builded; 1129-11 and by understanding 8394 it is established: 3559-113

24:4 And by knowledge 1847 shall the chambers 2315 be filled 4390-11 with all precious 3368 and pleasant 5273 riches. 1952

24:5 A wise 2450 man 1397 [is] strong; 5797 yea, a man 376 of knowledge 1847 increaseth 553-18 strength. 3581

24:6 For by wise counsel 8458 thou shalt make 6213-4 thy war: 4421 and in multitude 7230 of counsellors 3289-6 [there is] safety. 8668

24:7 Wisdom 2454 [is] too high 7311-6 for a fool: 191 he openeth 6605-4 not his mouth 6310 in the gate. 8179

24:8 He that deviseth 2803-18 to do evil 7489-53 shall be called 7121-4 a mischievous 4209 person. 1167

24:9 The thought 2154 of foolishness 200 [is] sin: 2403 and the scorner 3887-5 [is] an abomination 8441 to men. 120

24:10 [If] thou faint 7503-98 in the day 3117 of adversity, 6869 thy strength 3581 [is] small. 6862

24:11 If thou forbear 2820-4 to deliver 5337-54 [them that are] drawn 3947-7 unto death, 4194 and [those that are] ready 4131-5 to be slain; 2027

24:12 If thou sayest, 559-4 Behold, we knew 3045-1 it not; doth not he that pondereth 8505-6 the heart 3826 consider 995-4 [it]? and he that keepeth 5341-6 thy soul, 5315 doth [not] he know 3045-4 [it]? and shall [not] he render 7725-52 to [every] man 120 according to his works? 6467

24:13 My son, 1121 eat 398-3 thou honey, 1706 because [it is] good; 2896 and the honeycomb, 5317 [which is] sweet 4966 to thy taste: 2441

24:14 So [shall] the knowledge 3045-3 of wisdom 2451 [be] unto thy soul: 5315 when thou hast found 4672-1 [it], then there shall be 3426 a reward, 319 and thy expectation 8615 shall not be cut off. 3772-11

24:15 Lay not wait, 693-4 O wicked 7563 [man], against the dwelling 5116 of the righteous; 6662 spoil 7703-17 not his resting place: 7258

24:16 For a just 6662 [man] falleth 5307-4 seven times, 7651 and riseth up 6965-1 again: but the wicked 7563 shall fall 3782-11 into mischief. 7451

24:17 Rejoice 8055-4 not when thine enemy 341-6 falleth, 5307-2 and let not thine heart 3820 be glad 1523-4 when he stumbleth: 3782-9

24:18 Lest the LORD 3068 see 7200-4 [it], and it displease 7489-1 5869 him, and he turn away 7725-52 his wrath 639 from him.

24:19 Fret 2734-101 not thyself because of evil 7489-56 [men], neither be thou envious 7065-17 at the wicked; 7563

24:20 For there shall be no reward 319 to the evil 7451 [man]; the candle 5216 of the wicked 7563 shall be put out. 1846-4

24:21 My son, 1121 fear 3372-3 thou the LORD 3068 and the king: 4428 [and] meddle 6148-101 not with them that are given to change: 8138-6

24:22 For their calamity 343 shall rise 6965-4 suddenly; 6597 and who knoweth 3045-6 the ruin 6365 of them both? 8147

24:23 These [things] also [belong] to the wise. 2450 [It is] not good 2896 to have respect 5234-53 of persons 6440 in judgment. 4941

24:24 He that saith 559-6 unto the wicked, 7563 Thou [art] righteous; 6662 him shall the people 5971 curse, 5344-4 nations 3816 shall abhor 2194-4 him:

24:25 But to them that rebuke 3198-56 [him] shall be delight, 5276-4 and a good 2896 blessing 1293 shall come 935-4 upon them.

24:26 [Every man] shall kiss 5401-4 [his] lips 8193 that giveth 7725-56 a right 5228 answer. 1697

24:27 Prepare 3559-54 thy work 4399 without, 2351 and make it fit 6257-16 for thyself in the field; 7704 and afterwards 310 build 1129-1 thine house. 1004

24:28 Be not a witness 5707 against thy neighbour 7453 without cause; 2600 and deceive 6601-14 [not] with thy lips. 8193

24:29 Say 559-4 not, I will do 6213-4 so to him as he hath done 6213-1 to me: I will render 7725-55 to the man 376 according to his work. 6467

24:30 I went 5674-1 by the field 7704 of the slothful, 376 6102 and by the vineyard 3754 of the man 120 void 2638 of understanding; 3820

24:31 And, lo, it was all grown over 5927-1 with thorns, 7063 [and] nettles 2738 had covered 3680-27 the face 6440 thereof, and the stone 68 wall 1444 thereof was broken down. 2040-8

24:32 Then I saw, 2372-4 [and] considered 7896-4 3820 [it] well: I looked 7200-1 upon [it, and] received 3947-1 instruction. 4148

24:33 [Yet] a little 4592 sleep, 8142 a little 4592 slumber, 8572 a little 4592 folding 2264 of the hands 3027 to sleep: 7901-2

24:34 So shall thy poverty 7389 come 935-1 [as] one that travelleth; 1980-102 and thy want 4270 as an armed 4043 man. 376

25:1 These [are] also proverbs 4912 of Solomon, 8010 which the men 582 of Hezekiah 2396 king 4428 of Judah 3063 copied out. 6275-52

25:2 [It is] the glory 3519 of God 430 to conceal 5641-53 a thing: 1697 but the honour 3519 of kings 4428 [is] to search out 2713-2 a matter. 1697

25:3 The heaven 8064 for height, 7312 and the earth 776 for depth, 6011 and the heart 3820 of kings 4428 [is] unsearchable. 369 2714

25:4 Take away 1898-2 the dross 5509 from the silver, 3701 and there shall come forth 3318-4 a vessel 3627 for the finer. 6884-6

25:5 Take away 1898-2 the wicked 7563 [from] before 6440 the king, 4428 and his throne 3678 shall be established 3559-11 in righteousness. 6664

25:6 Put not forth 1921-101 thyself in the presence 6440 of the king, 4428 and stand 5975-4 not in the place 4725 of great 1419 [men]:

25:7 For better 2896 [it is] that it be said 559-2 unto thee, Come up 5927-3 hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower 8213-53 in the presence 6440 of the prince 5081 whom thine eyes 5869 have seen. 7200-1

25:8 Go not forth 3318-4 hastily 4118 to strive, 7378-2 lest [thou know not] what to do 6213-4 in the end thereof, 319 when thy neighbour 7453 hath put thee to shame. 3637-53

25:9 Debate 7378-3 thy cause 7379 with thy neighbour 7453 [himself]; and discover 1540-17 not a secret 5475 to another: 312

25:10 Lest he that heareth 8085-6 [it] put thee to shame, 2616-17 and thine infamy 1681 turn not away. 7725-4

25:11 A word 1697 fitly 212|655-k spoken 1696-7 [is like] apples 8598 of gold 2091 in pictures 4906 of silver. 3701

25:12 [As] an earring 5141 of gold, 2091 and an ornament 2481 of fine gold, 3800 [so is] a wise 2450 reprover 3198-56 upon an obedient 8085-6 ear. 241

25:13 As the cold 6793 of snow 7950 in the time 3117 of harvest, 7105 [so is] a faithful 539-12 messenger 6735 to them that send 7971-6 him: for he refresheth 7725-55 the soul 5315 of his masters. 113

25:14 Whoso 376 boasteth 1984-102 himself of a false 8267 gift 4991 [is like] clouds 5387 and wind 7307 without rain. 1653

25:15 By long 753 forbearing 639 is a prince 7101 persuaded, 6601-29 and a soft 7390 tongue 3956 breaketh 7665-4 the bone. 1634

25:16 Hast thou found 4672-1 honey? 1706 eat 398-3 so much as is sufficient 1767 for thee, lest thou be filled 7646-4 therewith, and vomit 6958-52 it.

25:17 Withdraw 3365-54 thy foot 7272 from thy neighbour's 7453 house; 1004 lest he be weary 7646-4 of thee, and [so] hate 8130-1 thee.

25:18 A man 376 that beareth 6030-6 false 8267 witness 5707 against his neighbour 7453 [is] a maul, 4650 and a sword, 2719 and a sharp 8150-6 arrow. 2671

25:19 Confidence 4009 in an unfaithful man 898-6 in time 3117 of trouble 6869 [is like] a broken 7465 tooth, 8127 and a foot 7272 out of joint. 4154

25:20 [As] he that taketh away 5710-56 a garment 899 in cold 7135 weather, 3117 [and as] vinegar 2558 upon nitre, 5427 so [is] he that singeth 7891-6 songs 7892 to an heavy 7451 heart. 3820

25:21 If thine enemy 8130-6 be hungry, 7457 give him bread 3899 to eat; 398-54 and if he be thirsty, 6771 give him water 4325 to drink: 8248-54

25:22 For thou shalt heap 2846-6 coals of fire 1513 upon his head, 7218 and the LORD 3068 shall reward 7999-17 thee.

25:23 The north 6828 wind 7307 driveth away 2342-34 rain: 1653 so [doth] an angry 2194-12 countenance 6440 a backbiting 5643 tongue. 3956

25:24 [It is] better 2896 to dwell 3427-2 in the corner 6438 of the housetop, 1406 than with a brawling 4079|4066-k woman 802 and in a wide 2267 house. 1004

25:25 [As] cold 7119 waters 4325 to a thirsty 5889 soul, 5315 so [is] good 2896 news 8052 from a far 4801 country. 776

25:26 A righteous 6662 man falling down 4131-5 before 6440 the wicked 7563 [is as] a troubled 7515-12 fountain, 4599 and a corrupt 7843-94 spring. 4726

25:27 [It is] not good 2896 to eat 398-2 much 7235-53 honey: 1706 so [for men] to search 2714 their own glory 3519 [is not] glory. 3519

25:28 He 376 that [hath] no rule 4623 over his own spirit 7307 [is like] a city 5892 [that is] broken down, 6555-7 [and] without walls. 2346

26:1 As snow 7950 in summer, 7019 and as rain 4306 in harvest, 7105 so honour 3519 is not seemly 5000 for a fool. 3684

26:2 As the bird 6833 by wandering, 5110-2 as the swallow 1866 by flying, 5774-2 so the curse 7045 causeless 2600 shall not come. 935-4

26:3 A whip 7752 for the horse, 5483 a bridle 4964 for the ass, 2543 and a rod 7626 for the fool's 3684 back. 1460

26:4 Answer 6030-4 not a fool 3684 according to his folly, 200 lest thou also be like 7737-4 unto him.

26:5 Answer 6030-3 a fool 3684 according to his folly, 200 lest he be wise 2450 in his own conceit. 5869

26:6 He that sendeth 7971-6 a message 1697 by the hand 3027 of a fool 3684 cutteth off 7096-18 the feet, 7272 [and] drinketh 8354-6 damage. 2555

26:7 The legs 7785 of the lame 6455 are not equal: 1809-1 so [is] a parable 4912 in the mouth 6310 of fools. 3684

26:8 As he that bindeth 6872|6887-2 a stone 68 in a sling, 4773 so [is] he that giveth 5414-6 honour 3519 to a fool. 3684

26:9 [As] a thorn 2336 goeth up 5927-1 into the hand 3027 of a drunkard, 7910 so [is] a parable 4912 in the mouth 6310 of fools. 3684

26:10 The great 7227 [God] that formed 2342-35 all [things] both rewardeth 7936-6 the fool, 3684 and rewardeth 7936-6 transgressors. 5674-6

26:11 As a dog 3611 returneth 7725-1 to his vomit, 6892 [so] a fool 3684 returneth 8138-6 to his folly. 200

26:12 Seest 7200-1 thou a man 376 wise 2450 in his own conceit? 5869 [there is] more hope 8615 of a fool 3684 than of him.

26:13 The slothful 6102 [man] saith, 559-1 [There is] a lion 7826 in the way; 1870 a lion 738 [is] in the streets. 7339

26:14 [As] the door 1817 turneth 5437-11 upon his hinges, 6735 so [doth] the slothful 6102 upon his bed. 4296

26:15 The slothful 6102 hideth 2934-1 his hand 3027 in [his] bosom; 6747 it grieveth 3811-8 him to bring it again 7725-53 to his mouth. 6310

26:16 The sluggard 6102 [is] wiser 2450 in his own conceit 5869 than seven 7651 men that can render 7725-56 a reason. 2940

26:17 He that passeth by, 5674-6 [and] meddleth 5674-102 with strife 7379 [belonging] not to him, [is like] one that taketh 2388-56 a dog 3611 by the ears. 241

26:18 As a mad 3856-119 [man] who casteth 3384-6 firebrands, 2131 arrows, 2671 and death, 4194

26:19 So [is] the man 376 [that] deceiveth 7411-14 his neighbour, 7453 and saith, 559-1 Am not I in sport? 7832-18

26:20 Where no 657 wood 6086 is, [there] the fire 784 goeth out: 3518-4 so where [there is] no talebearer, 5372 the strife 4066 ceaseth. 8367-4

26:21 [As] coals 6352 [are] to burning coals, 1513 and wood 6086 to fire; 784 so [is] a contentious 4079|4066-k man 376 to kindle 2787-44 strife. 7379

26:22 The words 1697 of a talebearer 5372 [are] as wounds, 3859-102 and they go down 3381-1 into the innermost parts 2315 of the belly. 990

26:23 Burning 1814-5 lips 8193 and a wicked 7451 heart 3820 [are like] a potsherd 2789 covered 6823-30 with silver 3701 dross. 5509

26:24 He that hateth 8130-6 dissembleth 5234-11 with his lips, 8193 and layeth up 7896-4 deceit 4820 within 7130 him;

26:25 When he speaketh 6963 fair, 2603-17 believe 539-55 him not: for [there are] seven 7651 abominations 8441 in his heart. 3820

26:26 [Whose] hatred 8135 is covered 3680-101 by deceit, 4860 his wickedness 7451 shall be shewed 1540-11 before the [whole] congregation. 6951

26:27 Whoso diggeth 3738-6 a pit 7845 shall fall 5307-4 therein: and he that rolleth 1556-6 a stone, 68 it will return 7725-4 upon him.

26:28 A lying 8267 tongue 3956 hateth 8130-4 [those that are] afflicted 1790 by it; and a flattering 2509 mouth 6310 worketh 6213-4 ruin. 4072

27:1 Boast 1984-101 not thyself of to morrow; 3117 4279 for thou knowest 3045-4 not what a day 3117 may bring forth. 3205-4

27:2 Let another man 2114-5 praise 1984-17 thee, and not thine own mouth; 6310 a stranger, 5237 and not thine own lips. 8193

27:3 A stone 68 [is] heavy, 3514 and the sand 2344 weighty; 5192 but a fool's 191 wrath 3708 [is] heavier 3515 than them both. 8147

27:4 Wrath 2534 [is] cruel, 395 and anger 639 [is] outrageous; 7858 but who [is] able to stand 5975-4 before 6440 envy? 7068

27:5 Open 1540-30 rebuke 8433 [is] better 2896 than secret 5641-30 love. 160

27:6 Faithful 539-12 [are] the wounds 6482 of a friend; 157-6 but the kisses 5390 of an enemy 8130-6 [are] deceitful. 6280-12

27:7 The full 7649 soul 5315 loatheth 947-4 an honeycomb; 5317 but to the hungry 7457 soul 5315 every bitter 4751 thing is sweet. 4966

27:8 As a bird 6833 that wandereth 5074-6 from her nest, 7064 so [is] a man 376 that wandereth 5074-6 from his place. 4725

27:9 Ointment 8081 and perfume 7004 rejoice 8055-17 the heart: 3820 so [doth] the sweetness 4986 of a man's friend 7453 by hearty 5315 counsel. 6098

27:10 Thine own friend, 7453 and thy father's 1 friend, 7453 forsake 5800-4 not; neither go 935-4 into thy brother's 251 house 1004 in the day 3117 of thy calamity: 343 [for] better 2896 [is] a neighbour 7934 [that is] near 7138 than a brother 251 far off. 7350

27:11 My son, 1121 be wise, 2449-3 and make my heart 3820 glad, 8055-16 that I may answer 7725-55 1697 him that reproacheth 2778-6 me.

27:12 A prudent 6175 [man] foreseeth 7200-1 the evil, 7451 [and] hideth 5641-8 himself; [but] the simple 6612 pass on, 5674-1 [and] are punished. 6064-8

27:13 Take 3947-3 his garment 899 that is surety 6148-1 for a stranger, 2114-5 and take a pledge 2254-3 of him for a strange 5237 woman.

27:14 He that blesseth 1288-18 his friend 7453 with a loud 1419 voice, 6963 rising early 7925-53 in the morning, 1242 it shall be counted 2803-11 a curse 7045 to him.

27:15 A continual 2956-6 dropping 1812 in a very rainy 5464 day 3117 and a contentious 4079|4066-k woman 802 are alike. 7737-13

27:16 Whosoever hideth 6845-6 her hideth 6845-1 the wind, 7307 and the ointment 8081 of his right hand, 3225 [which] bewrayeth 7121-4 [itself].

27:17 Iron 1270 sharpeneth 2300-4 iron; 1270 so a man 376 sharpeneth 2300-55 the countenance 6440 of his friend. 7453

27:18 Whoso keepeth 5341-6 the fig tree 8384 shall eat 398-4 the fruit 6529 thereof: so he that waiteth 8104-6 on his master 113 shall be honoured. 3513-29

27:19 As in water 4325 face 6440 [answereth] to face, 6440 so the heart 3820 of man 120 to man. 120

27:20 Hell 7585 and destruction 11|10-k are never 3808 full; 7646-4 so the eyes 5869 of man 120 are never satisfied. 7646-4

27:21 [As] the fining pot 4715 for silver, 3701 and the furnace 3564 for gold; 2091 so [is] a man 376 to 6310 his praise. 4110

27:22 Though thou shouldest bray 3806-4 a fool 191 in a mortar 4388 among 8432 wheat 7383 with a pestle, 5940 [yet] will not his foolishness 200 depart 5493-4 from him.

27:23 Be thou diligent 3045-4 to know 3045-2 the state 6440 of thy flocks, 6629 [and] look 7896-3 well 3820 to thy herds. 5739

27:24 For riches 2633 [are] not for ever: 5769 and doth the crown 5145 [endure] to every 1755 generation? 1755

27:25 The hay 2682 appeareth, 1540-1 and the tender grass 1877 sheweth 7200-8 itself, and herbs 6212 of the mountains 2022 are gathered. 622-8

27:26 The lambs 3532 [are] for thy clothing, 3830 and the goats 6260 [are] the price 4242 of the field. 7704

27:27 And [thou shalt have] goats' 5795 milk 2461 enough 1767 for thy food, 3899 for the food 3899 of thy household, 1004 and [for] the maintenance 2416 for thy maidens. 5291

28:1 The wicked 7563 flee 5127-1 when no man pursueth: 7291-6 but the righteous 6662 are bold 982-4 as a lion. 3715

28:2 For the transgression 6588 of a land 776 many 7227 [are] the princes 8269 thereof: but by a man 120 of understanding 995-56 [and] knowledge 3045-6 the state 3651 [thereof] shall be prolonged. 748-55

28:3 A poor 7326-6 man 1397 that oppresseth 6231-6 the poor 1800 [is like] a sweeping 5502-6 rain 4306 which leaveth no food. 3899

28:4 They that forsake 5800-6 the law 8451 praise 1984-17 the wicked: 7563 but such as keep 8104-6 the law 8451 contend 1624-101 with them.

28:5 Evil 7451 men 582 understand 995-4 not judgment: 4941 but they that seek 1245-18 the LORD 3068 understand 995-4 all [things].

28:6 Better 2896 [is] the poor 7326-6 that walketh 1980-6 in his uprightness, 8537 than [he that is] perverse 6141 [in his] ways, 1870 though he [be] rich. 6223

28:7 Whoso keepeth 5341-6 the law 8451 [is] a wise 995-56 son: 1121 but he that is a companion 7462-6 of riotous 2151-6 [men] shameth 3637-55 his father. 1

28:8 He that by usury 5392 and unjust gain 8636 increaseth 7235-56 his substance, 1952 he shall gather 6908-17 it for him that will pity 2603-6 the poor. 1800

28:9 He that turneth away 5493-56 his ear 241 from hearing 8085-2 the law, 8451 even his prayer 8605 [shall be] abomination. 8441

28:10 Whoso causeth the righteous 3477 to go astray 7686-56 in an evil 7451 way, 1870 he shall fall 5307-4 himself into his own pit: 7816 but the upright 8549 shall have good 2896 [things] in possession. 5157-4

28:11 The rich 6223 man 376 [is] wise 2450 in his own conceit; 5869 but the poor 1800 that hath understanding 995-56 searcheth him out. 2713-4

28:12 When righteous 6662 [men] do rejoice, 5970-2 [there is] great 7227 glory: 8597 but when the wicked 7563 rise, 6965-2 a man 120 is hidden. 2664-29

28:13 He that covereth 3680-18 his sins 6588 shall not prosper: 6743-55 but whoso confesseth 3034-56 and forsaketh 5800-6 [them] shall have mercy. 7355-29

28:14 Happy 835 [is] the man 120 that feareth 6342-18 alway: 8548 but he that hardeneth 7185-56 his heart 3820 shall fall 5307-4 into mischief. 7451

28:15 [As] a roaring 5098-6 lion, 738 and a ranging 8264-6 bear; 1677 [so is] a wicked 7563 ruler 4910-6 over the poor 1800 people. 5971

28:16 The prince 5057 that wanteth 2638 understanding 8394 [is] also a great 7227 oppressor: 4642 [but] he that hateth 8130-6 covetousness 1215 shall prolong 748-55 [his] days. 3117

28:17 A man 120 that doeth violence 6231-7 to the blood 1818 of [any] person 5315 shall flee 5127-4 to the pit; 953 let no man stay 8551-4 him.

28:18 Whoso walketh 1980-6 uprightly 8549 shall be saved: 3467-11 but [he that is] perverse 6140-12 [in his] ways 1870 shall fall 5307-4 at once. 259

28:19 He that tilleth 5647-6 his land 127 shall have plenty 7646-4 of bread: 3899 but he that followeth 7291-18 after vain 7386 [persons] shall have poverty 7389 enough. 7646-4

28:20 A faithful 530 man 376 shall abound 7227 with blessings: 1293 but he that maketh haste 213-5 to be rich 6238-53 shall not be innocent. 5352-11

28:21 To have respect 5234-53 of persons 6440 [is] not good: 2896 for for a piece 6595 of bread 3899 [that] man 1397 will transgress. 6586-4

28:22 He 376 that hasteth 926-12 to be rich 1952 [hath] an evil 7451 eye, 5869 and considereth 3045-4 not that poverty 2639 shall come 935-4 upon him.

28:23 He that rebuketh 3198-56 a man 120 afterwards 310 shall find 4672-4 more favour 2580 than he that flattereth 2505-56 with the tongue. 3956

28:24 Whoso robbeth 1497-6 his father 1 or his mother, 517 and saith, 559-6 [It is] no transgression; 6588 the same [is] the companion 2270 of a destroyer. 376 7843-56

28:25 He that is of a proud 7342 heart 5315 stirreth up 1624-17 strife: 4066 but he that putteth his trust 982-6 in the LORD 3068 shall be made fat. 1878-29

28:26 He that trusteth 982-6 in his own heart 3820 is a fool: 3684 but whoso walketh 1980-6 wisely, 2451 he shall be delivered. 4422-11

28:27 He that giveth 5414-6 unto the poor 7326-6 shall not lack: 4270 but he that hideth 5956-56 his eyes 5869 shall have many 7227 a curse. 3994

28:28 When the wicked 7563 rise, 6965-2 men 120 hide 5641-11 themselves: but when they perish, 6-2 the righteous 6662 increase. 7235-4

29:1 He, 376 that being often reproved 8433 hardeneth 7185-56 [his] neck, 6203 shall suddenly 6621 be destroyed, 7665-11 and that without remedy. 4832

29:2 When the righteous 6662 are in authority, 7235-2 the people 5971 rejoice: 8055-4 but when the wicked 7563 beareth rule, 4910-2 the people 5971 mourn. 584-11

29:3 Whoso 376 loveth 157-6 wisdom 2451 rejoiceth 8055-17 his father: 1 but he that keepeth company 7462-6 with harlots 2181-6 spendeth 6-17 [his] substance. 1952

29:4 The king 4428 by judgment 4941 establisheth 5975-55 the land: 776 but he 376 that receiveth gifts 8641 overthroweth 2040-4 it.

29:5 A man 1397 that flattereth 2505-56 his neighbour 7453 spreadeth 6566-6 a net 7568 for his feet. 6471

29:6 In the transgression 6588 of an evil 7451 man 376 [there is] a snare: 4170 but the righteous 6662 doth sing 7442-4 and rejoice. 8056

29:7 The righteous 6662 considereth 3045-6 the cause 1779 of the poor: 1800 [but] the wicked 7563 regardeth 995-4 not to know 1847 [it].

29:8 Scornful 3944 men 582 bring a city 7151 into a snare: 6315-55 but wise 2450 [men] turn away 7725-55 wrath. 639

29:9 [If] a wise 2450 man 376 contendeth 8199-12 with a foolish 191 man, 376 whether he rage 7264-1 or laugh, 7832-1 [there is] no rest. 5183

29:10 The bloodthirsty 582 1818 hate 8130-4 the upright: 8535 but the just 3477 seek 1245-17 his soul. 5315

29:11 A fool 3684 uttereth 3318-55 all his mind: 7307 but a wise 2450 [man] keepeth 7623-17 it in till afterwards. 268

29:12 If a ruler 4910-6 hearken 7181-56 to lies, 1697 8267 all his servants 8334-18 [are] wicked. 7563

29:13 The poor 7326-6 and the deceitful 8501 man 376 meet 6298-8 together: the LORD 3068 lighteneth 215-56 both 8147 their eyes. 5869

29:14 The king 4428 that faithfully 571 judgeth 8199-6 the poor, 1800 his throne 3678 shall be established 3559-11 for ever. 5703

29:15 The rod 7626 and reproof 8433 give 5414-4 wisdom: 2451 but a child 5288 left 7971-30 [to himself] bringeth his mother 517 to shame. 954-56

29:16 When the wicked 7563 are multiplied, 7235-2 transgression 6588 increaseth: 7235-4 but the righteous 6662 shall see 7200-4 their fall. 4658

29:17 Correct 3256-16 thy son, 1121 and he shall give thee rest; 5117-55 yea, he shall give 5414-4 delight 4574 unto thy soul. 5315

29:18 Where [there is] no vision, 2377 the people 5971 perish: 6544-11 but he that keepeth 8104-6 the law, 8451 happy 835 [is] he.

29:19 A servant 5650 will not be corrected 3256-11 by words: 1697 for though he understand 995-4 he will not answer. 4617

29:20 Seest 2372-1 thou a man 376 [that is] hasty 213-5 in his words? 1697 [there is] more hope 8615 of a fool 3684 than of him.

29:21 He that delicately bringeth up 6445-18 his servant 5650 from a child 5290 shall have him become [his] son 4497 at the length. 319

29:22 An angry 639 man 376 stirreth up 1624-17 strife, 4066 and a furious 2534 man 1167 aboundeth 7227 in transgression. 6588

29:23 A man's 120 pride 1346 shall bring him low: 8213-55 but honour 3519 shall uphold 8551-4 the humble 8217 in spirit. 7307

29:24 Whoso is partner 2505-6 with a thief 1590 hateth 8130-6 his own soul: 5315 he heareth 8085-4 cursing, 423 and bewrayeth 5046-55 [it] not.

29:25 The fear 2731 of man 120 bringeth 5414-4 a snare: 4170 but whoso putteth his trust 982-6 in the LORD 3068 shall be safe. 7682-29

29:26 Many 7227 seek 1245-18 the ruler's 4910-6 favour; 6440 but [every] man's 376 judgment 4941 [cometh] from the LORD. 3068

29:27 An unjust 5766 man 376 [is] an abomination 8441 to the just: 6662 and [he that is] upright 3477 in the way 1870 [is] abomination 8441 to the wicked. 7563

30:1 The words 1697 of Agur 94 the son 1121 of Jakeh, 3348 [even] the prophecy: 4853 the man 1397 spake 5002-7 unto Ithiel, 384 even unto Ithiel 384 and Ucal, 401

30:2 Surely I [am] more brutish 1198 than [any] man, 376 and have not the understanding 998 of a man. 120

30:3 I neither learned 3925-1 wisdom, 2451 nor have 3045-4 the knowledge 1847 of the holy. 6918

30:4 Who hath ascended 5927-1 up into heaven, 8064 or descended? 3381-4 who hath gathered 622-1 the wind 7307 in his fists? 2651 who hath bound 6887-1 the waters 4325 in a garment? 8071 who hath established 6965-52 all the ends 657 of the earth? 776 what [is] his name, 8034 and what [is] his son's 1121 name, 8034 if thou canst tell? 3045-4

30:5 Every word 565 of God 433 [is] pure: 6884-7 he [is] a shield 4043 unto them that put their trust 2620-6 in him.

30:6 Add 3254-55 thou not unto his words, 1697 lest he reprove 3198-55 thee, and thou be found a liar. 3576-8

30:7 Two 8147 [things] have I required 7592-1 of thee; deny 4513-4 me [them] not before I die: 4191-4

30:8 Remove far 7368-54 from me vanity 7723 and lies: 1697 3577 give 5414-4 me neither poverty 7389 nor riches; 6239 feed 2963-54 me with food 3899 convenient 2706 for me:

30:9 Lest I be full, 7646-4 and deny 3584-14 [thee], and say, 559-1 Who [is] the LORD? 3068 or lest I be poor, 3423-11 and steal, 1589-1 and take 8610-1 the name 8034 of my God 430 [in vain].

30:10 Accuse 3960-55 not a servant 5650 unto his master, 113 lest he curse 7043-17 thee, and thou be found guilty. 816-1

30:11 [There is] a generation 1755 [that] curseth 7043-17 their father, 1 and doth not bless 1288-17 their mother. 517

30:12 [There is] a generation 1755 [that are] pure 2889 in their own eyes, 5869 and [yet] is not washed 7364-27 from their filthiness. 6675

30:13 [There is] a generation, 1755 O how lofty 7311-1 are their eyes! 5869 and their eyelids 6079 are lifted up. 5375-11

30:14 [There is] a generation, 1755 whose teeth 8127 [are as] swords, 2719 and their jaw teeth 4973 [as] knives, 3979 to devour 398-2 the poor 6041 from off the earth, 776 and the needy 34 from [among] men. 120

30:15 The horseleach 5936 hath two 8147 daughters, 1323 [crying], Give, 3051-3 give. 3051-3 There are three 7969 [things that] are never satisfied, 7646-4 [yea], four 702 [things] say 559-1 not, [It is] enough: 1952

30:16 The grave; 7585 and the barren 6115 womb; 7356 the earth 776 [that] is not filled 7646-1 with water; 4325 and the fire 784 [that] saith 559-1 not, [It is] enough. 1952

30:17 The eye 5869 [that] mocketh 3932-4 at [his] father, 1 and despiseth 936-4 to obey 3349 [his] mother, 517 the ravens 6158 of the valley 5158 shall pick it out, 5365-4 and the young 1121 eagles 5404 shall eat 398-4 it.

30:18 There be three 7969 [things which] are too wonderful 6381-8 for me, yea, four 702 which I know 3045-1 not:

30:19 The way 1870 of an eagle 5404 in the air; 8064 the way 1870 of a serpent 5175 upon a rock; 6697 the way 1870 of a ship 591 in the midst 3820 of the sea; 3220 and the way 1870 of a man 1397 with a maid. 5959

30:20 Such [is] the way 1870 of an adulterous 5003-18 woman; 802 she eateth, 398-1 and wipeth 4229-1 her mouth, 6310 and saith, 559-1 I have done 6466-1 no wickedness. 205

30:21 For three 7969 [things] the earth 776 is disquieted, 7264-1 and for four 702 [which] it cannot 3808 3201-4 bear: 5375-2

30:22 For a servant 5650 when he reigneth; 4427-4 and a fool 5036 when he is filled 7646-4 with meat; 3899

30:23 For an odious 8130-7 [woman] when she is married; 1166-11 and an handmaid 8198 that is heir 3423-4 to her mistress. 1404

30:24 There be four 702 [things which are] little 6996 upon the earth, 776 but they [are] exceeding 2449-30 wise: 2450

30:25 The ants 5244 [are] a people 5971 not strong, 5794 yet they prepare 3559-55 their meat 3899 in the summer; 7019

30:26 The conies 8227 [are but] a feeble 3808 6099 folk, 5971 yet make 7760-4 they their houses 1004 in the rocks; 5553

30:27 The locusts 697 have no king, 4428 yet go they forth 3318-4 all of them by bands; 2686-6

30:28 The spider 8079 taketh hold 8610-17 with her hands, 3027 and is in kings' 4428 palaces. 1964

30:29 There be three 7969 [things] which go 6806 well, 2895-56 yea, four 702 are comely 3190-56 in going: 3212-2

30:30 A lion 3918 [which is] strongest 1368 among beasts, 929 and turneth not away 7725-4 for 6440 any;

30:31 A greyhound; 4975 2223 an he goat 8495 also; 176 and a king, 4428 against whom [there is] no rising up. 510

30:32 If thou hast done foolishly 5034-1 in lifting up 5375-99 thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, 2161-1 [lay] thine hand 3027 upon thy mouth. 6310

30:33 Surely the churning 4330 of milk 2461 bringeth forth 3318-55 butter, 2529 and the wringing 4330 of the nose 639 bringeth forth 3318-55 blood: 1818 so the forcing 4330 of wrath 639 bringeth forth 3318-55 strife. 7379

31:1 The words 1697 of king 4428 Lemuel, 3927 the prophecy 4853 that his mother 517 taught 3256-14 him.

31:2 What, my son? 1248 and what, the son 1248 of my womb? 990 and what, the son 1248 of my vows? 5088

31:3 Give 5414-4 not thy strength 2428 unto women, 802 nor thy ways 1870 to that which destroyeth 4229-53 kings. 4428

31:4 [It is] not for kings, 4428 O Lemuel, 3927 [it is] not for kings 4428 to drink 8354-2 wine; 3196 nor for princes 7336-6 335-q|176-k strong drink: 7941

31:5 Lest they drink, 8354-4 and forget 7911-4 the law, 2710-30 and pervert 8138-17 the judgment 1779 of any of the afflicted. 1121 6040

31:6 Give 5414-3 strong drink 7941 unto him that is ready to perish, 6-6 and wine 3196 unto those that be of heavy 4751 hearts. 5315

31:7 Let him drink, 8354-4 and forget 7911-4 his poverty, 7389 and remember 2142-4 his misery 5999 no more.

31:8 Open 6605-3 thy mouth 6310 for the dumb 483 in the cause 1779 of all such as are appointed 1121 to destruction. 2475

31:9 Open 6605-3 thy mouth, 6310 judge 8199-3 righteously, 6664 and plead 1777-3 the cause of the poor 6041 and needy. 34

31:10 Who can find 4672-4 a virtuous 2428 woman? 802 for her price 4377 [is] far 7350 above rubies. 6443

31:11 The heart 3820 of her husband 1167 doth safely trust 982-1 in her, so that he shall have no need 2637-4 of spoil. 7998

31:12 She will do 1580-1 him good 2896 and not evil 7451 all the days 3117 of her life. 2416

31:13 She seeketh 1875-1 wool, 6785 and flax, 6593 and worketh 6213-4 willingly 2656 with her hands. 3709

31:14 She is like the merchants' 5503-6 ships; 591 she bringeth 935-55 her food 3899 from afar. 4801

31:15 She riseth 6965-4 also while it is yet night, 3915 and giveth 5414-4 meat 2964 to her household, 1004 and a portion 2706 to her maidens. 5291

31:16 She considereth 2161-1 a field, 7704 and buyeth 3947-4 it: with the fruit 6529 of her hands 3709 she planteth 5193-1 a vineyard. 3754

31:17 She girdeth 2296-1 her loins 4975 with strength, 5797 and strengtheneth 553-17 her arms. 2220

31:18 She perceiveth 2938-1 that her merchandise 5504 [is] good: 2896 her candle 5216 goeth not out 3518-4 by night. 3915

31:19 She layeth 7971-14 her hands 3027 to the spindle, 3601 and her hands 3709 hold 8551-1 the distaff. 6418

31:20 She stretcheth 6566-1 out her hand 3709 to the poor; 6041 yea, she reacheth forth 7971-14 her hands 3027 to the needy. 34

31:21 She is not afraid 3372-4 of the snow 7950 for her household: 1004 for all her household 1004 [are] clothed 3847-7 with scarlet. 8144

31:22 She maketh 6213-1 herself coverings of tapestry; 4765 her clothing 3830 [is] silk 8336 and purple. 713

31:23 Her husband 1167 is known 3045-12 in the gates, 8179 when he sitteth 3427-2 among the elders 2205 of the land. 776

31:24 She maketh 6213-1 fine linen, 5466 and selleth 4376-4 [it]; and delivereth 5414-1 girdles 2289 unto the merchant. 3669

31:25 Strength 5797 and honour 1926 [are] her clothing; 3830 and she shall rejoice 7832-4 in time 3117 to come. 314

31:26 She openeth 6605-1 her mouth 6310 with wisdom; 2451 and in her tongue 3956 [is] the law 8451 of kindness. 2617

31:27 She looketh well 6822-6 to the ways 1979|1979-k of her household, 1004 and eateth 398-4 not the bread 3899 of idleness. 6104

31:28 Her children 1121 arise up, 6965-1 and call her blessed; 833-17 her husband 1167 [also], and he praiseth 1984-17 her.

31:29 Many 7227 daughters 1323 have done 6213-1 virtuously, 2428 but thou excellest 5927-1 them all.

31:30 Favour 2580 [is] deceitful, 8267 and beauty 3308 [is] vain: 1892 [but] a woman 802 [that] feareth 3373 the LORD, 3068 she shall be praised. 1984-101

31:31 Give 5414-3 her of the fruit 6529 of her hands; 3027 and let her own works 4639 praise 1984-17 her in the gates. 8179
