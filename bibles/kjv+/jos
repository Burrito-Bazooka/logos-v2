1:1 Now after 310 the death 4194 of Moses 4872 the servant 5650 of the LORD 3068 it came to pass, that the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun, 5126 Moses' 4872 minister, 8334-18 saying, 559-2

1:2 Moses 4872 my servant 5650 is dead; 4191-1 now therefore arise, 6965-3 go over 5674-3 this Jordan, 3383 thou, and all this people, 5971 unto the land 776 which I do give 5414-6 to them, [even] to the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

1:3 Every place 4725 that the sole 3709 of your foot 7272 shall tread 1869-4 upon, that have I given 5414-1 unto you, as I said 1696-14 unto Moses. 4872

1:4 From the wilderness 4057 and this Lebanon 3844 even unto the great 1419 river, 5104 the river 5104 Euphrates, 6578 all the land 776 of the Hittites, 2850 and unto the great 1419 sea 3220 toward the going down 3996 of the sun, 8121 shall be your coast. 1366

1:5 There shall not any man 376 be able to stand 3320-101 before 6440 thee all the days 3117 of thy life: 2416 as I was with Moses, 4872 [so] I will be with thee: I will not fail 7503-55 thee, nor forsake 5800-4 thee.

1:6 Be strong 2388-3 and of a good courage: 553-3 for unto this people 5971 shalt thou divide for an inheritance 5157-55 the land, 776 which I sware 7650-8 unto their fathers 1 to give 5414-2 them.

1:7 Only be thou strong 2388-3 and very 3966 courageous, 553-3 that thou mayest observe 8104-2 to do 6213-2 according to all the law, 8451 which Moses 4872 my servant 5650 commanded 6680-14 thee: turn 5493-4 not from it [to] the right hand 3225 or [to] the left, 8040 that thou mayest prosper 7919-55 whithersoever thou goest. 3212-4

1:8 This book 5612 of the law 8451 shall not depart 4185-4 out of thy mouth; 6310 but thou shalt meditate 1897-1 therein day 3119 and night, 3915 that thou mayest observe 8104-4 to do 6213-2 according to all that is written 3789-7 therein: for then thou shalt make thy way 1870 prosperous, 6743-55 and then thou shalt have good success. 7919-55

1:9 Have not I commanded 6680-14 thee? Be strong 2388-3 and of a good courage; 553-3 be not afraid, 6206-4 neither be thou dismayed: 2865-11 for the LORD 3068 thy God 430 [is] with thee whithersoever thou goest. 3212-4

1:10 Then Joshua 3091 commanded 6680-17 the officers 7860-6 of the people, 5971 saying, 559-2

1:11 Pass 5674-3 through 7130 the host, 4264 and command 6680-16 the people, 5971 saying, 559-2 Prepare 3559-54 you victuals; 6720 for within three 7969 days 3117 ye shall pass over 5674-6 this Jordan, 3383 to go in 935-2 to possess 3423-2 the land, 776 which the LORD 3068 your God 430 giveth 5414-6 you to possess 3423-2 it.

1:12 And to the Reubenites, 7206 and to the Gadites, 1425 and to half 2677 the tribe 7626 of Manasseh, 4519 spake 559-1 Joshua, 3091 saying, 559-2

1:13 Remember 2142-2 the word 1697 which Moses 4872 the servant 5650 of the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 you, saying, 559-2 The LORD 3068 your God 430 hath given you rest, 5117-56 and hath given 5414-1 you this land. 776

1:14 Your wives, 802 your little ones, 2945 and your cattle, 4735 shall remain 3427-4 in the land 776 which Moses 4872 gave 5414-1 you on this side 5676 Jordan; 3383 but ye shall pass 5674-4 before 6440 your brethren 251 armed, 2571 all the mighty 1368 men of valour, 2428 and help 5826-1 them;

1:15 Until the LORD 3068 have given your brethren 251 rest, 5117-55 as [he hath given] you, and they also have possessed 3423-1 the land 776 which the LORD 3068 your God 430 giveth 5414-6 them: then ye shall return 7725-1 unto the land 776 of your possession, 3425 and enjoy 3423-1 it, which Moses 4872 the LORD'S 3068 servant 5650 gave 5414-1 you on this side 5676 Jordan 3383 toward the sunrising. 4217 8121

1:16 And they answered 6030-4 Joshua, 3091 saying, 559-2 All that thou commandest 6680-14 us we will do, 6213-4 and whithersoever 834 thou sendest 7971-4 us, we will go. 3212-4

1:17 According as we hearkened 8085-1 unto Moses 4872 in all things, so will we hearken 8085-4 unto thee: only the LORD 3068 thy God 430 be with thee, as he was with Moses. 4872

1:18 Whosoever 376 [he be] that doth rebel 4784-55 against thy commandment, 6310 and will not hearken 8085-4 unto thy words 1697 in all that thou commandest 6680-17 him, he shall be put to death: 4191-93 only be strong 2388-3 and of a good courage. 553-3

2:1 And Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun 5126 sent 7971-4 out of Shittim 7851 two 8147 men 582 to spy 7270-18 secretly, 2791 saying, 559-2 Go 3212-3 view 7200-3 the land, 776 even Jericho. 3405 And they went, 3212-4 and came 935-4 into an harlot's 802 2181-6 house, 1004 named 8034 Rahab, 7343 and lodged 7901-4 there.

2:2 And it was told 559-11 the king 4428 of Jericho, 3405 saying, 559-2 Behold, there came 935-1 men 582 in hither to night 3915 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 to search out 2658-2 the country. 776

2:3 And the king 4428 of Jericho 3405 sent 7971-4 unto Rahab, 7343 saying, 559-2 Bring forth 3318-54 the men 582 that are come 935-6 to thee, which are entered 935-1 into thine house: 1004 for they be come 935-1 to search out 2658-2 all the country. 776

2:4 And the woman 802 took 3947-4 the two 8147 men, 582 and hid 6845-4 them, and said 559-4 thus, There came 935-1 men 582 unto me, but I wist 3045-1 not whence 370 they [were]:

2:5 And it came to pass [about the time] of shutting 5462-2 of the gate, 8179 when it was dark, 2822 that the men 582 went out: 3318-1 whither the men 582 went 1980-1 I wot 3045-1 not: pursue 7291-3 after 310 them quickly; 4118 for ye shall overtake 5381-55 them.

2:6 But she had brought them up 5927-52 to the roof 1406 of the house, and hid 2934-4 them with the stalks 6086 of flax, 6593 which she had laid in order 6186-7 upon the roof. 1406

2:7 And the men 582 pursued 7291-1 after 310 them the way 1870 to Jordan 3383 unto the fords: 4569 and as soon 310 as they which pursued 7291-6 after 310 them were gone out, 3318-1 they shut 5462-1 the gate. 8179

2:8 And before they were laid down, 7901-4 she came up 5927-1 unto them upon the roof; 1406

2:9 And she said 559-4 unto the men, 582 I know 3045-1 that the LORD 3068 hath given 5414-1 you the land, 776 and that your terror 367 is fallen 5307-1 upon us, and that all the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land 776 faint 4127-8 because 6440 of you.

2:10 For we have heard 8085-1 how the LORD 3068 dried up 3001-52 the water 4325 of the Red 5488 sea 3220 for you, 6440 when ye came out 3318-2 of Egypt; 4714 and what ye did 6213-1 unto the two 8147 kings 4428 of the Amorites, 567 that [were] on the other side 5676 Jordan, 3383 Sihon 5511 and Og, 5747 whom ye utterly destroyed. 2763-52

2:11 And as soon as we had heard 8085-4 [these things], our hearts 3824 did melt, 4549-11 neither did there remain 6965-1 any more courage 7307 in any man, 376 because 6440 of you: for the LORD 3068 your God, 430 he [is] God 430 in heaven 8064 above, 4605 and in earth 776 beneath.

2:12 Now therefore, I pray you, swear 7650-10 unto me by the LORD, 3068 since 3588 I have shewed 6213-1 you kindness, 2617 that ye will also shew 6213-1 kindness 2617 unto my father's 1 house, 1004 and give 5414-1 me a true 571 token: 226

2:13 And [that] ye will save alive 2421-52 my father, 1 and my mother, 517 and my brethren, 251 and my sisters, 269 and all that they have, and deliver 5337-52 our lives 5315 from death. 4194

2:14 And the men 582 answered 559-4 her, Our life 5315 for yours, 4191-2 if ye utter 5046-55 not this our business. 1697 And it shall be, when the LORD 3068 hath given 5414-2 us the land, 776 that we will deal 6213-1 kindly 2617 and truly 571 with thee.

2:15 Then she let them down 3381-55 by a cord 2256 through 1157 the window: 2474 for her house 1004 [was] upon the town 7023 wall, 2346 and she dwelt 3427-6 upon the wall. 2346

2:16 And she said 559-4 unto them, Get 3212-3 you to the mountain, 2022 lest the pursuers 7291-6 meet 6293-4 you; and hide 2247-8 yourselves there three 7969 days, 3117 until the pursuers 7291-6 be returned: 7725-2 and afterward 310 may ye go 3212-4 your way. 1870

2:17 And the men 582 said 559-4 unto her, We [will be] blameless 5355 of this thine oath 7621 which thou hast made us swear. 7650-52

2:18 Behold, [when] we come 935-6 into the land, 776 thou shalt bind 7194-4 this line 8615 of scarlet 8144 thread 2339 in the window 2474 which thou didst let us down 3381-52 by: and thou shalt bring 622-4 thy father, 1 and thy mother, 517 and thy brethren, 251 and all thy father's 1 household, 1004 home 1004 unto thee.

2:19 And it shall be, [that] whosoever 834 shall go out 3318-4 of the doors 1817 of thy house 1004 into the street, 2351 his blood 1818 [shall be] upon his head, 7218 and we [will be] guiltless: 5355 and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, 1004 his blood 1818 [shall be] on our head, 7218 if [any] hand 3027 be upon him.

2:20 And if thou utter 5046-55 this our business, 1697 then we will be quit 5355 of thine oath 7621 which thou hast made us to swear. 7650-52

2:21 And she said, 559-4 According unto your words, 1697 so [be] it. And she sent them away, 7971-17 and they departed: 3212-4 and she bound 7194-4 the scarlet 8144 line 8615 in the window. 2474

2:22 And they went, 3212-4 and came 935-4 unto the mountain, 2022 and abode 3427-4 there three 7969 days, 3117 until the pursuers 7291-6 were returned: 7725-1 and the pursuers 7291-6 sought 1245-17 [them] throughout all the way, 1870 but found 4672-1 [them] not.

2:23 So the two 8147 men 582 returned, 7725-4 and descended 3381-4 from the mountain, 2022 and passed over, 5674-4 and came 935-4 to Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun, 5126 and told 5608-17 him all [things] that befell 4672-6 them:

2:24 And they said 559-4 unto Joshua, 3091 Truly 3588 the LORD 3068 hath delivered 5414-1 into our hands 3027 all the land; 776 for even all the inhabitants 3427-6 of the country 776 do faint 4127-8 because 6440 of us.

3:1 And Joshua 3091 rose early 7925-55 in the morning; 1242 and they removed 5265-4 from Shittim, 7851 and came 935-4 to Jordan, 3383 he and all the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and lodged 3885-4 there before they passed over. 5674-4

3:2 And it came to pass after 7097 three 7969 days, 3117 that the officers 7860-6 went 5674-4 through 7130 the host; 4264

3:3 And they commanded 6680-17 the people, 5971 saying, 559-2 When ye see 7200-2 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 your God, 430 and the priests 3548 the Levites 3881 bearing 5375-6 it, then ye shall remove 5265-4 from your place, 4725 and go 1980-1 after 310 it.

3:4 Yet there shall be a space 7350 between you and it, about two thousand 505 cubits 520 by measure: 4060 come not near 7126-4 unto it, that ye may know 3045-4 the way 1870 by which ye must go: 3212-4 for ye have not passed 5674-1 [this] way 1870 heretofore. 8543 8032

3:5 And Joshua 3091 said 559-4 unto the people, 5971 Sanctify 6942-100 yourselves: for to morrow 4279 the LORD 3068 will do 6213-4 wonders 6381-12 among 7130 you.

3:6 And Joshua 3091 spake 559-4 unto the priests, 3548 saying, 559-2 Take up 5375-3 the ark 727 of the covenant, 1285 and pass over 5674-3 before 6440 the people. 5971 And they took up 5375-4 the ark 727 of the covenant, 1285 and went 3212-4 before 6440 the people. 5971

3:7 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Joshua, 3091 This day 3117 will I begin 2490-55 to magnify 1431-15 thee in the sight 5869 of all Israel, 3478 that they may know 3045-4 that, as I was with Moses, 4872 [so] I will be with thee.

3:8 And thou shalt command 6680-17 the priests 3548 that bear 5375-6 the ark 727 of the covenant, 1285 saying, 559-2 When ye are come 935-2 to the brink 7097 of the water 4325 of Jordan, 3383 ye shall stand still 5975-4 in Jordan. 3383

3:9 And Joshua 3091 said 559-4 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 Come hither, 5066-3 and hear 8085-3 the words 1697 of the LORD 3068 your God. 430

3:10 And Joshua 3091 said, 559-4 Hereby ye shall know 3045-4 that the living 2416 God 410 [is] among 7130 you, and [that] he will without fail 3423-53 drive out 3423-55 from before 6440 you the Canaanites, 3669 and the Hittites, 2850 and the Hivites, 2340 and the Perizzites, 6522 and the Girgashites, 1622 and the Amorites, 567 and the Jebusites. 2983

3:11 Behold, the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the Lord 113 of all the earth 776 passeth over 5674-6 before 6440 you into Jordan. 3383

3:12 Now therefore take 3947-3 you twelve 8147 6240 men 376 out of the tribes 7626 of Israel, 3478 out of every 259 376 tribe 7626 a 259 man. 376

3:13 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles 3709 of the feet 7272 of the priests 3548 that bear 5375-6 the ark 727 of the LORD, 3068 the Lord 113 of all the earth, 776 shall rest 5117-2 in the waters 4325 of Jordan, 3383 [that] the waters 4325 of Jordan 3383 shall be cut off 3772-11 [from] the waters 4325 that come down 3381-6 from above; 4605 and they shall stand 5975-4 upon an 259 heap. 5067

3:14 And it came to pass, when the people 5971 removed 5265-2 from their tents, 168 to pass over 5674-2 Jordan, 3383 and the priests 3548 bearing 5375-6 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 before 6440 the people; 5971

3:15 And as they that bare 5375-6 the ark 727 were come 935-2 unto Jordan, 3383 and the feet 7272 of the priests 3548 that bare 5375-6 the ark 727 were dipped 2881-8 in the brim 7097 of the water, 4325 (for Jordan 3383 overfloweth 4390-1 all his banks 1415 all the time 3117 of harvest,) 7105

3:16 That the waters 4325 which came down 3381-6 from above 4605 stood 5975-4 [and] rose up 6965-1 upon an 259 heap 5067 very 3966 far 7368-53 from the city 5892 Adam, 121 that [is] beside 6654 Zaretan: 6891 and those that came down 3381-6 toward the sea 3220 of the plain, 6160 [even] the salt 4417 sea, 3220 failed, 8552-1 [and] were cut off: 3772-8 and the people 5971 passed over 5674-1 right against Jericho. 3405

3:17 And the priests 3548 that bare 5375-6 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 stood 5975-4 firm 3559-53 on dry ground 2724 in the midst 8432 of Jordan, 3383 and all the Israelites 3478 passed over 5674-6 on dry ground, 2724 until all the people 1471 were passed clean 8552-1 over 5674-2 Jordan. 3383

4:1 And it came to pass, when all the people 1471 were clean 8552-1 passed over 5674-2 Jordan, 3383 that the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto Joshua, 3091 saying, 559-2

4:2 Take 3947-3 you twelve 8147 6240 men 582 out of the people, 5971 out of every 259 376 tribe 7626 a 259 man, 376

4:3 And command 6680-16 ye them, saying, 559-2 Take 5375-3 you hence out of the midst 8432 of Jordan, 3383 out of the place where the priests' 3548 feet 7272 stood 4673 firm, 3559-53 twelve 8147 6240 stones, 68 and ye shall carry them over 5674-52 with you, and leave 3240-52 them in the lodging place, 4411 where ye shall lodge 3885-4 this night. 3915

4:4 Then Joshua 3091 called 7121-4 the twelve 8147 6240 men, 376 whom he had prepared 3559-52 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 out of every 259 376 tribe 7626 a 259 man: 376

4:5 And Joshua 3091 said 559-4 unto them, Pass over 5674-3 before 6440 the ark 727 of the LORD 3068 your God 430 into the midst 8432 of Jordan, 3383 and take ye up 7311-54 every man 376 of you a 259 stone 68 upon his shoulder, 7926 according unto the number 4557 of the tribes 7626 of the children 1121 of Israel: 3478

4:6 That this may be a sign 226 among 7130 you, [that] when your children 1121 ask 7592-4 [their fathers] in time to come, 4279 saying, 559-2 What [mean] ye by these stones? 68

4:7 Then ye shall answer 559-1 them, That the waters 4325 of Jordan 3383 were cut off 3772-8 before 6440 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD; 3068 when it passed over 5674-2 Jordan, 3383 the waters 4325 of Jordan 3383 were cut off: 3772-8 and these stones 68 shall be for a memorial 2146 unto the children 1121 of Israel 3478 for 5704 ever. 5769

4:8 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did 6213-4 so as Joshua 3091 commanded, 6680-14 and took up 5375-4 twelve 8147 6240 stones 68 out of the midst 8432 of Jordan, 3383 as the LORD 3068 spake 1696-14 unto Joshua, 3091 according to the number 4557 of the tribes 7626 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and carried them over 5674-55 with them unto the place where they lodged, 4411 and laid them down 3240-55 there.

4:9 And Joshua 3091 set up 6965-52 twelve 8147 6240 stones 68 in the midst 8432 of Jordan, 3383 in the place where the feet 7272 of the priests 3548 which bare 5375-6 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 stood: 4673 and they are there unto this day. 3117

4:10 For the priests 3548 which bare 5375-6 the ark 727 stood 5975-6 in the midst 8432 of Jordan, 3383 until every thing 1697 was finished 8552-2 that the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Joshua 3091 to speak 1696-15 unto the people, 5971 according to all that Moses 4872 commanded 6680-14 Joshua: 3091 and the people 5971 hasted 4116-17 and passed over. 5674-4

4:11 And it came to pass, when all the people 5971 were clean 8552-1 passed over, 5674-2 that the ark 727 of the LORD 3068 passed over, 5674-4 and the priests, 3548 in the presence 6440 of the people. 5971

4:12 And the children 1121 of Reuben, 7205 and the children 1121 of Gad, 1410 and half 2677 the tribe 7626 of Manasseh, 4519 passed over 5674-4 armed 2571 before 6440 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 as Moses 4872 spake 1696-14 unto them:

4:13 About forty 705 thousand 505 prepared 2502-7 for war 6635 passed over 5674-1 before 6440 the LORD 3068 unto battle, 4421 to the plains 6160 of Jericho. 3405

4:14 On that day 3117 the LORD 3068 magnified 1431-14 Joshua 3091 in the sight 5869 of all Israel; 3478 and they feared 3372-4 him, as they feared 3372-1 Moses, 4872 all the days 3117 of his life. 2416

4:15 And the LORD 3068 spake 559-4 unto Joshua, 3091 saying, 559-2

4:16 Command 6680-16 the priests 3548 that bear 5375-6 the ark 727 of the testimony, 5715 that they come up 5927-4 out of Jordan. 3383

4:17 Joshua 3091 therefore commanded 6680-17 the priests, 3548 saying, 559-2 Come ye up 5927-3 out of Jordan. 3383

4:18 And it came to pass, when the priests 3548 that bare 5375-6 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 were come up 5927-2 out of the midst 8432 of Jordan, 3383 [and] the soles 3709 of the priests' 3548 feet 7272 were lifted up 5423-8 unto the dry land, 2724 that the waters 4325 of Jordan 3383 returned 7725-4 unto their place, 4725 and flowed 3212-4 over all his banks, 1415 as 8543 [they did] before. 8032

4:19 And the people 5971 came up 5927-1 out of Jordan 3383 on the tenth 6218 [day] of the first 7223 month, 2320 and encamped 2583-4 in Gilgal, 1537 in the east 4217 border 7097 of Jericho. 3405

4:20 And those twelve 8147 6240 stones, 68 which they took 3947-1 out of Jordan, 3383 did Joshua 3091 pitch 6965-52 in Gilgal. 1537

4:21 And he spake 559-4 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saying, 559-2 When your children 1121 shall ask 7592-4 their fathers 1 in time to come, 4279 saying, 559-2 What [mean] these stones? 68

4:22 Then ye shall let your children 1121 know, 3045-52 saying, 559-2 Israel 3478 came over 5674-1 this Jordan 3383 on dry land. 3004

4:23 For the LORD 3068 your God 430 dried up 3001-52 the waters 4325 of Jordan 3383 from before 6440 you, until ye were passed over, 5674-2 as the LORD 3068 your God 430 did 6213-1 to the Red 5488 sea, 3220 which he dried up 3001-52 from before 6440 us, until we were gone over: 5674-2

4:24 That all the people 5971 of the earth 776 might know 3045-2 the hand 3027 of the LORD, 3068 that it [is] mighty: 2389 that ye might fear 3372-1 the LORD 3068 your God 430 for ever. 3605 3117

5:1 And it came to pass, when all the kings 4428 of the Amorites, 567 which [were] on the side 5676 of Jordan 3383 westward, 3220 and all the kings 4428 of the Canaanites, 3669 which [were] by the sea, 3220 heard 8085-2 that the LORD 3068 had dried up 3001-52 the waters 4325 of Jordan 3383 from before 6440 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 until we were passed over, 5674-2 that their heart 3824 melted, 4549-11 neither was there spirit 7307 in them any more, because 6440 of the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

5:2 At that time 6256 the LORD 3068 said 559-1 unto Joshua, 3091 Make 6213-3 thee sharp 6697 knives, 2719 and circumcise 4135-3 again 7725-3 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 the second time. 8145

5:3 And Joshua 3091 made 6213-4 him sharp 6697 knives, 2719 and circumcised 4135-4 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 at the hill of the foreskins. 1390|6190|1389

5:4 And this [is] the cause 1697 why Joshua 3091 did circumcise: 4135-1 All the people 5971 that came out 3318-6 of Egypt, 4714 [that were] males, 2145 [even] all the men 582 of war, 4421 died 4191-1 in the wilderness 4057 by the way, 1870 after they came out 3318-2 of Egypt. 4714

5:5 Now 3588 all the people 5971 that came out 3318-6 were circumcised: 4135-7 but all the people 5971 [that were] born 3209 in the wilderness 4057 by the way 1870 as they came forth 3318-2 out of Egypt, 4714 [them] they had not circumcised. 4135-1

5:6 For the children 1121 of Israel 3478 walked 1980-1 forty 705 years 8141 in the wilderness, 4057 till all the people 1471 [that were] men 582 of war, 4421 which came out 3318-6 of Egypt, 4714 were consumed, 8552-2 because they obeyed 8085-1 not the voice 6963 of the LORD: 3068 unto whom the LORD 3068 sware 7650-8 that he would not shew 7200-53 them the land, 776 which the LORD 3068 sware 7650-8 unto their fathers 1 that he would give 5414-2 us, a land 776 that floweth 2100-6 with milk 2461 and honey. 1706

5:7 And their children, 1121 [whom] he raised up 6965-52 in their stead, them Joshua 3091 circumcised: 4135-1 for they were uncircumcised, 6189 because they had not circumcised 4135-1 them by the way. 1870

5:8 And it came to pass, when they had done 8552-1 circumcising 4135-9 all the people, 1471 that they abode 3427-4 in their places in the camp, 4264 till they were whole. 2421-2

5:9 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Joshua, 3091 This day 3117 have I rolled away 1556-1 the reproach 2781 of Egypt 4714 from off you. Wherefore the name 8034 of the place 4725 is called 7121-4 Gilgal 1537 unto this day. 3117

5:10 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 encamped 2583-4 in Gilgal, 1537 and kept 6213-4 the passover 6453 on the fourteenth 702 6240 day 3117 of the month 2320 at even 6153 in the plains 6160 of Jericho. 3405

5:11 And they did eat 398-4 of the old corn 5669 of the land 776 on the morrow 4283 after the passover, 6453 unleavened cakes, 4682 and parched 7033-7 [corn] in the selfsame 6106 day. 3117

5:12 And the manna 4478 ceased 7673-4 on the morrow 4283 after they had eaten 398-2 of the old corn 5669 of the land; 776 neither had the children 1121 of Israel 3478 manna 4478 any more; but they did eat 398-4 of the fruit 8393 of the land 776 of Canaan 3667 that year. 8141

5:13 And it came to pass, when Joshua 3091 was by Jericho, 3405 that he lifted up 5375-4 his eyes 5869 and looked, 7200-4 and, behold, there stood 5975-6 a man 376 over against him with his sword 2719 drawn 8025-7 in his hand: 3027 and Joshua 3091 went 3212-4 unto him, and said 559-4 unto him, [Art] thou for us, or for our adversaries? 6862

5:14 And he said, 559-4 Nay; but [as] captain 8269 of the host 6635 of the LORD 3068 am I now come. 935-1 And Joshua 3091 fell 5307-4 on his face 6440 to the earth, 776 and did worship, 7812-101 and said 559-4 unto him, What saith 1696-18 my lord 113 unto his servant? 5650

5:15 And the captain 8269 of the LORD'S 3068 host 6635 said 559-4 unto Joshua, 3091 Loose 5394-3 thy shoe 5275 from off thy foot; 7272 for the place 4725 whereon thou standest 5975-6 [is] holy. 6944 And Joshua 3091 did 6213-4 so.

6:1 Now Jericho 3405 was straitly 5462-6 shut up 5462-30 because 6440 of the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 none went out, 3318-6 and none came in. 935-6

6:2 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Joshua, 3091 See, 7200-3 I have given 5414-1 into thine hand 3027 Jericho, 3405 and the king 4428 thereof, [and] the mighty men 1368 of valour. 2428

6:3 And ye shall compass 5437-1 the city, 5892 all [ye] men 582 of war, 4421 [and] go round about 5362-53 the city 5892 once. 6471 259 Thus shalt thou do 6213-4 six 8337 days. 3117

6:4 And seven 7651 priests 3548 shall bear 5375-4 before 6440 the ark 727 seven 7651 trumpets 7782 of rams' horns: 3104 and the seventh 7637 day 3117 ye shall compass 5437-4 the city 5892 seven 7651 times, 6471 and the priests 3548 shall blow 8628-4 with the trumpets. 7782

6:5 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long 4900-2 [blast] with the ram's 3104 horn, 7161 [and] when ye hear 8085-2 the sound 6963 of the trumpet, 7782 all the people 5971 shall shout 7321-55 with a great 1419 shout; 8643 and the wall 2346 of the city 5892 shall fall down 5307-1 flat, 8478 and the people 5971 shall ascend up 5927-1 every man 376 straight before him.

6:6 And Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun 5126 called 7121-4 the priests, 3548 and said 559-4 unto them, Take up 5375-3 the ark 727 of the covenant, 1285 and let seven 7651 priests 3548 bear 5375-4 seven 7651 trumpets 7782 of rams' horns 3104 before 6440 the ark 727 of the LORD. 3068

6:7 And he said 559-4 unto the people, 5971 Pass on, 5674-3 and compass 5437-3 the city, 5892 and let him that is armed 2502-7 pass on 5674-4 before 6440 the ark 727 of the LORD. 3068

6:8 And it came to pass, when Joshua 3091 had spoken 559-2 unto the people, 5971 that the seven 7651 priests 3548 bearing 5375-6 the seven 7651 trumpets 7782 of rams' horns 3104 passed on 5674-1 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 and blew 8628-1 with the trumpets: 7782 and the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 followed 1980-6 them. 310

6:9 And the armed 2502-7 men went 1980-6 before 6440 the priests 3548 that blew 8628-6|8628-1-k with the trumpets, 7782 and the rereward 622-18 came 1980-6 after 310 the ark, 727 [the priests] going on, 1980-2 and blowing 8628-2 with the trumpets. 7782

6:10 And Joshua 3091 had commanded 6680-14 the people, 5971 saying, 559-2 Ye shall not shout, 7321-55 nor make any noise 8085-55 with your voice, 6963 neither shall [any] word 1697 proceed 3318-4 out of your mouth, 6310 until the day 3117 I bid 559-2 you shout; 7321-54 then shall ye shout. 7321-52

6:11 So the ark 727 of the LORD 3068 compassed 5437-55 the city, 5892 going about 5362-53 [it] once: 6471 259 and they came 935-4 into the camp, 4264 and lodged 3885-4 in the camp. 4264

6:12 And Joshua 3091 rose early 7925-55 in the morning, 1242 and the priests 3548 took up 5375-4 the ark 727 of the LORD. 3068

6:13 And seven 7651 priests 3548 bearing 5375-6 seven 7651 trumpets 7782 of rams' horns 3104 before 6440 the ark 727 of the LORD 3068 went on 1980-6 continually, 1980-2 and blew 8628-1 with the trumpets: 7782 and the armed 2502-7 men went 1980-6 before 6440 them; but the rereward 622-18 came 1980-6 after 310 the ark 727 of the LORD, 3068 [the priests] going on, 1980-2 and blowing 8628-2 with the trumpets. 7782

6:14 And the second 8145 day 3117 they compassed 5437-4 the city 5892 once, 6471 259 and returned 7725-4 into the camp: 4264 so they did 6213-1 six 8337 days. 3117

6:15 And it came to pass on the seventh 7637 day, 3117 that they rose early 7925-55 about the dawning 5927-2 of the day, 7837 and compassed 5437-4 the city 5892 after the same manner 4941 seven 7651 times: 6471 only on that day 3117 they compassed 5437-1 the city 5892 seven 7651 times. 6471

6:16 And it came to pass at the seventh 7637 time, 6471 when the priests 3548 blew 8628-1 with the trumpets, 7782 Joshua 3091 said 559-4 unto the people, 5971 Shout; 7321-54 for the LORD 3068 hath given 5414-1 you the city. 5892

6:17 And the city 5892 shall be accursed, 2764 [even] it, and all that [are] therein, to the LORD: 3068 only Rahab 7343 the harlot 2181-6 shall live, 2421-4 she and all that [are] with her in the house, 1004 because she hid 2244-52 the messengers 4397 that we sent. 7971-1

6:18 And ye, in any wise 7535 keep 8104-3 [yourselves] from the accursed thing, 2764 lest ye make [yourselves] accursed, 2763-55 when ye take 3947-1 of the accursed thing, 2764 and make 7760-1 the camp 4264 of Israel 3478 a curse, 2764 and trouble 5916-1 it.

6:19 But all the silver, 3701 and gold, 2091 and vessels 3627 of brass 5178 and iron, 1270 [are] consecrated 6944 unto the LORD: 3068 they shall come 935-4 into the treasury 214 of the LORD. 3068

6:20 So the people 5971 shouted 7321-55 when [the priests] blew 8628-4 with the trumpets: 7782 and it came to pass, when the people 5971 heard 8085-2 the sound 6963 of the trumpet, 7782 and the people 5971 shouted 7321-55 with a great 1419 shout, 8643 that the wall 2346 fell down 5307-4 flat, so that the people 5971 went up 5927-4 into the city, 5892 every man 376 straight before him, and they took 3920-4 the city. 5892

6:21 And they utterly destroyed 2763-55 all that [was] in the city, 5892 both man 376 and woman, 802 young 5288 and old, 2205 and ox, 7794 and sheep, 7716 and ass, 2543 with the edge 6310 of the sword. 2719

6:22 But Joshua 3091 had said 559-1 unto the two 8147 men 582 that had spied out 7270-18 the country, 776 Go 935-3 into the harlot's 802 2181-6 house, 1004 and bring out 3318-54 thence the woman, 802 and all that she hath, as ye sware 7650-8 unto her.

6:23 And the young men 5288 that were spies 7270-18 went in, 935-4 and brought out 3318-55 Rahab, 7343 and her father, 1 and her mother, 517 and her brethren, 251 and all that she had; and they brought out 3318-52 all her kindred, 4940 and left 3240-55 them without 2351 the camp 4264 of Israel. 3478

6:24 And they burnt 8313-1 the city 5892 with fire, 784 and all that [was] therein: only the silver, 3701 and the gold, 2091 and the vessels 3627 of brass 5178 and of iron, 1270 they put 5414-1 into the treasury 214 of the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

6:25 And Joshua 3091 saved Rahab 7343 the harlot 2181-6 alive, 2421-52 and her father's 1 household, 1004 and all that she had; and she dwelleth 3427-4 in 7130 Israel 3478 [even] unto this day; 3117 because she hid 2244-52 the messengers, 4397 which Joshua 3091 sent 7971-1 to spy out 7270-15 Jericho. 3405

6:26 And Joshua 3091 adjured 7650-55 [them] at that time, 6256 saying, 559-2 Cursed 779-7 [be] the man 376 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 that riseth up 6965-4 and buildeth 1129-1 this city 5892 Jericho: 3405 he shall lay the foundation 3245-17 thereof in his firstborn, 1060 and in his youngest 6810 [son] shall he set up 5324-55 the gates 1817 of it.

6:27 So the LORD 3068 was with Joshua; 3091 and his fame 8089 was [noised] throughout all the country. 776

7:1 But the children 1121 of Israel 3478 committed 4603-4 a trespass 4604 in the accursed thing: 2764 for Achan, 5912 the son 1121 of Carmi, 3756 the son 1121 of Zabdi, 2067 the son 1121 of Zerah, 2226 of the tribe 4294 of Judah, 3063 took 3947-4 of the accursed thing: 2764 and the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 was kindled 2734-4 against the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

7:2 And Joshua 3091 sent 7971-4 men 582 from Jericho 3405 to Ai, 5857 which [is] beside 5973 Bethaven, 1007 on the east side 6924 of Bethel, 1008 and spake 559-4 unto them, saying, 559-2 Go up 5927-3 and view 7270-16 the country. 776 And the men 582 went up 5927-4 and viewed 7270-17 Ai. 5857

7:3 And they returned 7725-4 to Joshua, 3091 and said 559-4 unto him, Let not all the people 5971 go up; 5927-4 but let about two or three 7969 thousand 505 505 men 376 376 go up 5927-4 and smite 5221-55 Ai; 5857 [and] make not all the people 5971 to labour 3021-17 thither; for they [are but] few. 4592

7:4 So there went up 5927-4 thither of the people 5971 about three 7969 thousand 505 men: 376 and they fled 5127-4 before 6440 the men 582 of Ai. 5857

7:5 And the men 582 of Ai 5857 smote 5221-55 of them about thirty 7970 and six 8337 men: 376 for they chased 7291-4 them [from] before 6440 the gate 8179 [even] unto Shebarim, 7671 and smote 5221-55 them in the going down: 4174 wherefore the hearts 3824 of the people 5971 melted, 4549-11 and became as water. 4325

7:6 And Joshua 3091 rent 7167-4 his clothes, 8071 and fell 5307-4 to the earth 776 upon his face 6440 before 6440 the ark 727 of the LORD 3068 until the eventide, 6153 he and the elders 2205 of Israel, 3478 and put 5927-55 dust 6083 upon their heads. 7218

7:7 And Joshua 3091 said, 559-4 Alas, O 162 Lord 136 GOD, 3069 wherefore hast thou at all 5674-53 brought this people 5971 over 5674-52 Jordan, 3383 to deliver 5414-2 us into the hand 3027 of the Amorites, 567 to destroy 6-53 us? would to God 3863 we had been content, 2974-52 and dwelt 3427-4 on the other side 5676 Jordan! 3383

7:8 O 994 Lord, 136 what shall I say, 559-4 when 310 Israel 3478 turneth 2015-1 their backs 6203 before 6440 their enemies! 341-6

7:9 For the Canaanites 3669 and all the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land 776 shall hear 8085-4 [of it], and shall environ us round, 5437-8 and cut off 3772-52 our name 8034 from the earth: 776 and what wilt thou do 6213-4 unto thy great 1419 name? 8034

7:10 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Joshua, 3091 Get thee up; 6965-3 wherefore liest 5307-6 thou thus upon thy face? 6440

7:11 Israel 3478 hath sinned, 2398-1 and they have also transgressed 5674-1 my covenant 1285 which I commanded 6680-14 them: for they have even taken 3947-1 of the accursed thing, 2764 and have also stolen, 1589-1 and dissembled 3584-14 also, and they have put 7760-1 [it] even among their own stuff. 3627

7:12 Therefore the children 1121 of Israel 3478 could 3201-4 not stand 6965-2 before 6440 their enemies, 341-6 [but] turned 6437-4 [their] backs 6203 before 6440 their enemies, 341-6 because they were accursed: 2764 neither will I be with you any more, 3254-55 except 3808 ye destroy 8045-55 the accursed 2764 from among 7130 you.

7:13 Up, 6965-3 sanctify 6942-16 the people, 5971 and say, 559-1 Sanctify 6942-100 yourselves against to morrow: 4279 for thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 [There is] an accursed thing 2764 in the midst 7130 of thee, O Israel: 3478 thou canst 3201-4 not stand 6965-2 before 6440 thine enemies, 341-6 until ye take away 5493-53 the accursed thing 2764 from among 7130 you.

7:14 In the morning 1242 therefore ye shall be brought 7126-8 according to your tribes: 7626 and it shall be, [that] the tribe 7626 which the LORD 3068 taketh 3920-4 shall come 7126-4 according to the families 4940 [thereof]; and the family 4940 which the LORD 3068 shall take 3920-4 shall come 7126-4 by households; 1004 and the household 1004 which the LORD 3068 shall take 3920-4 shall come 7126-4 man 1397 by man. 1397

7:15 And it shall be, [that] he that is taken 3920-12 with the accursed thing 2764 shall be burnt 8313-11 with fire, 784 he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed 5674-1 the covenant 1285 of the LORD, 3068 and because he hath wrought 6213-1 folly 5039 in Israel. 3478

7:16 So Joshua 3091 rose up early 7925-55 in the morning, 1242 and brought 7126-55 Israel 3478 by their tribes; 7626 and the tribe 7626 of Judah 3063 was taken: 3920-11

7:17 And he brought 7126-55 the family 4940 of Judah; 3063 and he took 3920-4 the family 4940 of the Zarhites: 2227 and he brought 7126-55 the family 4940 of the Zarhites 2227 man 1397 by man; 1397 and Zabdi 2067 was taken: 3920-11

7:18 And he brought 7126-55 his household 1004 man 1397 by man; 1397 and Achan, 5912 the son 1121 of Carmi, 3756 the son 1121 of Zabdi, 2067 the son 1121 of Zerah, 2226 of the tribe 4294 of Judah, 3063 was taken. 3920-11

7:19 And Joshua 3091 said 559-4 unto Achan, 5912 My son, 1121 give, 7760-3 I pray thee, glory 3519 to the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 and make 5414-3 confession 8426 unto him; and tell 5046-54 me now what thou hast done; 6213-1 hide 3582-17 [it] not from me.

7:20 And Achan 5912 answered 6030-4 Joshua, 3091 and said, 559-4 Indeed 546 I have sinned 2398-1 against the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 and thus and thus have I done: 6213-1

7:21 When I saw 7200-4 among the spoils 7998 a 259 goodly 2896 Babylonish 8152 garment, 155 and two hundred 3967 shekels 8255 of silver, 3701 and a 259 wedge 3956 of gold 2091 of fifty 2572 shekels 8255 weight, 4948 then I coveted 2530-4 them, and took 3947-4 them; and, behold, they [are] hid 2934-7 in the earth 776 in the midst 8432 of my tent, 168 and the silver 3701 under it.

7:22 So Joshua 3091 sent 7971-4 messengers, 4397 and they ran 7323-4 unto the tent; 168 and, behold, [it was] hid 2934-7 in his tent, 168 and the silver 3701 under it.

7:23 And they took 3947-4 them out of the midst 8432 of the tent, 168 and brought 935-55 them unto Joshua, 3091 and unto all the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and laid them out 3332-55 before 6440 the LORD. 3068

7:24 And Joshua, 3091 and all Israel 3478 with him, took 3947-4 Achan 5912 the son 1121 of Zerah, 2226 and the silver, 3701 and the garment, 155 and the wedge 3956 of gold, 2091 and his sons, 1121 and his daughters, 1323 and his oxen, 7794 and his asses, 2543 and his sheep, 6629 and his tent, 168 and all that he had: and they brought 5927-55 them unto the valley 6010 of Achor. 5911

7:25 And Joshua 3091 said, 559-4 Why 4100 hast thou troubled 5916-1 us? the LORD 3068 shall trouble 5916-4 thee this day. 3117 And all Israel 3478 stoned 7275-4 him with stones, 68 and burned 8313-4 them with fire, 784 after they had stoned 5619-4 them with stones. 68

7:26 And they raised 6965-55 over him a great 1419 heap 1530 of stones 68 unto this day. 3117 So the LORD 3068 turned 7725-4 from the fierceness 2740 of his anger. 639 Wherefore the name 8034 of that place 4725 was called, 7121-1 The valley 6010 of Achor, 5911 unto this day. 3117

8:1 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Joshua, 3091 Fear 3372-4 not, neither be thou dismayed: 2865-11 take 3947-3 all the people 5971 of war 4421 with thee, and arise, 6965-3 go up 5927-3 to Ai: 5857 see, 7200-3 I have given 5414-1 into thy hand 3027 the king 4428 of Ai, 5857 and his people, 5971 and his city, 5892 and his land: 776

8:2 And thou shalt do 6213-1 to Ai 5857 and her king 4428 as thou didst 6213-1 unto Jericho 3405 and her king: 4428 only the spoil 7998 thereof, and the cattle 929 thereof, shall ye take for a prey 962-4 unto yourselves: lay 7760-3 thee an ambush 693-6 for the city 5892 behind 310 it.

8:3 So Joshua 3091 arose, 6965-4 and all the people 5971 of war, 4421 to go up 5927-2 against Ai: 5857 and Joshua 3091 chose 977-4 out thirty 7970 thousand 505 mighty 1368 men 376 of valour, 2428 and sent them away 7971-4 by night. 3915

8:4 And he commanded 6680-17 them, saying, 559-2 Behold, 7200-3 ye shall lie in wait 693-6 against the city, 5892 [even] behind 310 the city: 5892 go not very 3966 far 7368-55 from the city, 5892 but be ye all ready: 3559-12

8:5 And I, and all the people 5971 that [are] with me, will approach 7126-4 unto the city: 5892 and it shall come to pass, when they come out 3318-4 against 7125-2 us, as at the first, 7223 that we will flee 5127-1 before 6440 them,

8:6 (For they will come out 3318-1 after 310 us) till we have drawn 5423-53 them from the city; 5892 for they will say, 559-4 They flee 5127-5 before 6440 us, as at the first: 7223 therefore we will flee 5127-1 before 6440 them.

8:7 Then ye shall rise up 6965-4 from the ambush, 693-6 and seize 3423-52 upon the city: 5892 for the LORD 3068 your God 430 will deliver 5414-1 it into your hand. 3027

8:8 And it shall be, when ye have taken 8610-2 the city, 5892 [that] ye shall set 3341-55 the city 5892 on fire: 784 according to the commandment 1697 of the LORD 3068 shall ye do. 6213-4 See, 7200-3 I have commanded 6680-14 you.

8:9 Joshua 3091 therefore sent them forth: 7971-4 and they went 3212-4 to lie in ambush, 3993 and abode 3427-4 between Bethel 1008 and Ai, 5857 on the west side 3220 of Ai: 5857 but Joshua 3091 lodged 3885-4 that night 3915 among 8432 the people. 5971

8:10 And Joshua 3091 rose up early 7925-55 in the morning, 1242 and numbered 6485-4 the people, 5971 and went up, 5927-4 he and the elders 2205 of Israel, 3478 before 6440 the people 5971 to Ai. 5857

8:11 And all the people, 5971 [even the people] of war 4421 that [were] with him, went up, 5927-1 and drew nigh, 5066-4 and came 935-4 before the city, 5892 and pitched 2583-4 on the north 6828 side of Ai: 5857 now [there was] a valley 1516 between them and Ai. 5857

8:12 And he took 3947-4 about five 2568 thousand 505 men, 376 and set 7760-4 them to lie in ambush 693-6 between Bethel 1008 and Ai, 5857 on the west side 3220 of the city. 5857|5892-k

8:13 And when they had set 7760-4 the people, 5971 [even] all the host 4264 that [was] on the north 6828 of the city, 5892 and their liers in wait 6119 on the west 3220 of the city, 5892 Joshua 3091 went 3212-4 that night 3915 into the midst 8432 of the valley. 6010

8:14 And it came to pass, when the king 4428 of Ai 5857 saw 7200-2 [it], that they hasted 4116-17 and rose up early, 7925-55 and the men 582 of the city 5892 went out 3318-4 against 7125-2 Israel 3478 to battle, 4421 he and all his people, 5971 at a time appointed, 4150 before 6440 the plain; 6160 but he wist 3045-1 not that [there were] liers in ambush 693-6 against him behind 310 the city. 5892

8:15 And Joshua 3091 and all Israel 3478 made as if they were beaten 5060-11 before 6440 them, and fled 5127-4 by the way 1870 of the wilderness. 4057

8:16 And all the people 5971 that [were] in Ai 5857|5892-k were called 2199-11 together to pursue 7291-2 after 310 them: and they pursued 7291-4 after 310 Joshua, 3091 and were drawn away 5423-11 from the city. 5892

8:17 And there was not a man 376 left 7604-8 in Ai 5857 or Bethel, 1008 that went not out 3318-1 after 310 Israel: 3478 and they left 5800-4 the city 5892 open, 6605-7 and pursued 7291-4 after 310 Israel. 3478

8:18 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Joshua, 3091 Stretch out 5186-3 the spear 3591 that [is] in thy hand 3027 toward Ai; 5857 for I will give 5414-4 it into thine hand. 3027 And Joshua 3091 stretched out 5186-4 the spear 3591 that [he had] in his hand 3027 toward the city. 5892

8:19 And the ambush 693-6 arose 6965-1 quickly 4120 out of their place, 4725 and they ran 7323-4 as soon as he had stretched out 5186-2 his hand: 3027 and they entered 935-4 into the city, 5892 and took 3920-4 it, and hasted 4116-17 and set 3341-55 the city 5892 on fire. 784

8:20 And when the men 582 of Ai 5857 looked 6437-4 behind 310 them, they saw, 7200-4 and, behold, the smoke 6227 of the city 5892 ascended up 5927-1 to heaven, 8064 and they had no power 3027 to flee 5127-2 this way 2008 or that way: 2008 and the people 5971 that fled 5127-5 to the wilderness 4057 turned back 2015-8 upon the pursuers. 7291-6

8:21 And when Joshua 3091 and all Israel 3478 saw 7200-1 that the ambush 693-6 had taken 3920-1 the city, 5892 and that the smoke 6227 of the city 5892 ascended, 5927-1 then they turned again, 7725-4 and slew 5221-55 the men 582 of Ai. 5857

8:22 And the other 428 issued out 3318-1 of the city 5892 against 7125-2 them; so they were in the midst 8432 of Israel, 3478 some 428 on this side, and some 428 on that side: and they smote 5221-55 them, so that 5704 they let 7604-52 none of them remain 8300 or escape. 6412

8:23 And the king 4428 of Ai 5857 they took 8610-1 alive, 2416 and brought 7126-55 him to Joshua. 3091

8:24 And it came to pass, when Israel 3478 had made an end 3615-15 of slaying 2026-2 all the inhabitants 3427-6 of Ai 5857 in the field, 7704 in the wilderness 4057 wherein they chased 7291-1 them, and when they were all fallen 5307-4 on the edge 6310 of the sword, 2719 until they were consumed, 8552-2 that all the Israelites 3478 returned 7725-4 unto Ai, 5857 and smote 5221-55 it with the edge 6310 of the sword. 2719

8:25 And [so] it was, [that] all that fell 5307-6 that day, 3117 both of men 376 and women, 802 [were] twelve 8147 6240 thousand, 505 [even] all the men 582 of Ai. 5857

8:26 For Joshua 3091 drew not his hand 3027 back, 7725-52 wherewith he stretched out 5186-1 the spear, 3591 until he had utterly destroyed 2763-52 all the inhabitants 3427-6 of Ai. 5857

8:27 Only the cattle 929 and the spoil 7998 of that city 5892 Israel 3478 took for a prey 962-1 unto themselves, according unto the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 which he commanded 6680-14 Joshua. 3091

8:28 And Joshua 3091 burnt 8313-4 Ai, 5857 and made 7760-4 it an heap 8510 for ever, 5769 [even] a desolation 8077 unto this day. 3117

8:29 And the king 4428 of Ai 5857 he hanged 8518-1 on a tree 6086 until eventide: 6256 6153 and as soon as the sun 8121 was down, 935-2 Joshua 3091 commanded 6680-14 that they should take his carcase 5038 down 3381-55 from the tree, 6086 and cast 7993-55 it at the entering 6607 of the gate 8179 of the city, 5892 and raise 6965-55 thereon a great 1419 heap 1530 of stones, 68 [that remaineth] unto this day. 3117

8:30 Then Joshua 3091 built 1129-4 an altar 4196 unto the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 in mount 2022 Ebal, 5858

8:31 As Moses 4872 the servant 5650 of the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 as it is written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the law 8451 of Moses, 4872 an altar 4196 of whole 8003 stones, 68 over which no man hath lift up 5130-52 [any] iron: 1270 and they offered 5927-55 thereon burnt offerings 5930 unto the LORD, 3068 and sacrificed 2076-4 peace offerings. 8002

8:32 And he wrote 3789-4 there upon the stones 68 a copy 4932 of the law 8451 of Moses, 4872 which he wrote 3789-1 in the presence 6440 of the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

8:33 And all Israel, 3478 and their elders, 2205 and officers, 7860-6 and their judges, 8199-6 stood 5975-6 on this side the ark 727 and on that side before the priests 3548 the Levites, 3881 which bare 5375-6 the ark 727 of the covenant 1285 of the LORD, 3068 as well the stranger, 1616 as he that was born among them; 249 half 2677 of them over 413 against 4136 mount 2022 Gerizim, 1630 and half 2677 of them over against 4136 mount 2022 Ebal; 5858 as Moses 4872 the servant 5650 of the LORD 3068 had commanded 6680-14 before, 7223 that they should bless 1288-15 the people 5971 of Israel. 3478

8:34 And afterward 310 he read 7121-1 all the words 1697 of the law, 8451 the blessings 1293 and cursings, 7045 according to all that is written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the law. 8451

8:35 There was not a word 1697 of all that Moses 4872 commanded, 6680-14 which Joshua 3091 read 7121-1 not before all the congregation 6951 of Israel, 3478 with the women, 802 and the little ones, 2945 and the strangers 1616 that were conversant 1980-6 among 7130 them.

9:1 And it came to pass, when all the kings 4428 which [were] on this side 5676 Jordan, 3383 in the hills, 2022 and in the valleys, 8219 and in all the coasts 2348 of the great 1419 sea 3220 over against 4136 Lebanon, 3844 the Hittite, 2850 and the Amorite, 567 the Canaanite, 3669 the Perizzite, 6522 the Hivite, 2340 and the Jebusite, 2983 heard 8085-2 [thereof];

9:2 That they gathered 6908-101 themselves together, 3162 to fight 3898-9 with Joshua 3091 and with Israel, 3478 with one 259 accord. 6310

9:3 And when the inhabitants 3427-6 of Gibeon 1391 heard 8085-1 what Joshua 3091 had done 6213-1 unto Jericho 3405 and to Ai, 5857

9:4 They did work 6213-4 wilily, 6195 and went 3212-4 and made as if they had been ambassadors, 6737-101 and took 3947-4 old 1087 sacks 8242 upon their asses, 2543 and wine 3196 bottles, 4997 old, 1087 and rent, 1234-30 and bound up; 6887-30

9:5 And old 1087 shoes 5275 and clouted 2921-30 upon their feet, 7272 and old 1087 garments 8008 upon them; and all the bread 3899 of their provision 6718 was dry 3001-1 [and] mouldy. 5350

9:6 And they went 3212-4 to Joshua 3091 unto the camp 4264 at Gilgal, 1537 and said 559-4 unto him, and to the men 376 of Israel, 3478 We be come 935-1 from a far 7350 country: 776 now therefore make 3772-3 ye a league 1285 with us.

9:7 And the men 376 of Israel 3478 said 559-4 unto the Hivites, 2340 Peradventure 194 ye dwell 3427-6 among 7130 us; and how shall we make 3772-4 a league 1285 with you?

9:8 And they said 559-4 unto Joshua, 3091 We [are] thy servants. 5650 And Joshua 3091 said 559-4 unto them, Who [are] ye? and from whence 370 come 935-4 ye?

9:9 And they said 559-4 unto him, From a very 3966 far 7350 country 776 thy servants 5650 are come 935-1 because of the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 thy God: 430 for we have heard 8085-1 the fame 8089 of him, and all that he did 6213-1 in Egypt, 4714

9:10 And all that he did 6213-1 to the two 8147 kings 4428 of the Amorites, 567 that [were] beyond 5676 Jordan, 3383 to Sihon 5511 king 4428 of Heshbon, 2809 and to Og 5747 king 4428 of Bashan, 1316 which [was] at Ashtaroth. 6252

9:11 Wherefore our elders 2205 and all the inhabitants 3427-6 of our country 776 spake 559-4 to us, saying, 559-2 Take 3947-3 victuals 6720 with you 3027 for the journey, 1870 and go 3212-3 to meet 7125-2 them, and say 559-1 unto them, We [are] your servants: 5650 therefore now make 3772-3 ye a league 1285 with us.

9:12 This our bread 3899 we took hot 2525 [for] our provision 6679-98 out of our houses 1004 on the day 3117 we came forth 3318-2 to go 3212-2 unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, 3001-1 and it is mouldy: 5350

9:13 And these bottles 4997 of wine, 3196 which we filled, 4390-14 [were] new; 2319 and, behold, they be rent: 1234-98 and these our garments 8008 and our shoes 5275 are become old 1086-1 by reason of the very 3966 long 7230 journey. 1870

9:14 And the men 582 took 3947-4 of their victuals, 6718 and asked 7592-1 not [counsel] at the mouth 6310 of the LORD. 3068

9:15 And Joshua 3091 made 6213-4 peace 7965 with them, and made 3772-4 a league 1285 with them, to let them live: 2421-15 and the princes 5387 of the congregation 5712 sware 7650-11 unto them.

9:16 And it came to pass at the end 7097 of three 7969 days 3117 after 310 they had made 3772-1 a league 1285 with them, that they heard 8085-4 that they [were] their neighbours, 7138 and [that] they dwelt 3427-6 among 7130 them.

9:17 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 journeyed, 5265-4 and came 935-4 unto their cities 5892 on the third 7992 day. 3117 Now their cities 5892 [were] Gibeon, 1391 and Chephirah, 3716 and Beeroth, 881 and Kirjathjearim. 7157

9:18 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 smote 5221-52 them not, because the princes 5387 of the congregation 5712 had sworn 7650-8 unto them by the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel. 3478 And all the congregation 5712 murmured 3885-11 against the princes. 5387

9:19 But all the princes 5387 said 559-4 unto all the congregation, 5712 We have sworn 7650-8 unto them by the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel: 3478 now therefore we may 3201-4 not touch 5060-2 them.

9:20 This we will do 6213-4 to them; we will even let them live, 2421-53 lest wrath 7110 be upon us, because of the oath 7621 which we sware 7650-8 unto them.

9:21 And the princes 5387 said 559-4 unto them, Let them live; 2421-4 but let them be hewers 2404-6 of wood 6086 and drawers 7579-6 of water 4325 unto all the congregation; 5712 as the princes 5387 had promised 1696-14 them.

9:22 And Joshua 3091 called 7121-4 for them, and he spake 1696-17 unto them, saying, 559-2 Wherefore have ye beguiled 7411-14 us, saying, 559-2 We [are] very 3966 far 7350 from you; when ye dwell 3427-6 among 7130 us?

9:23 Now therefore ye [are] cursed, 779-7 and there shall none of you be freed 3772-11 from being bondmen, 5650 and hewers 2404-6 of wood 6086 and drawers 7579-6 of water 4325 for the house 1004 of my God. 430

9:24 And they answered 6030-4 Joshua, 3091 and said, 559-4 Because it was certainly 5046-91 told 5046-90 thy servants, 5650 how that the LORD 3068 thy God 430 commanded 6680-14 his servant 5650 Moses 4872 to give 5414-2 you all the land, 776 and to destroy 8045-53 all the inhabitants 3427-6 of the land 776 from before 6440 you, therefore we were sore 3966 afraid 3372-4 of our lives 5315 because 6440 of you, and have done 6213-4 this thing. 1697

9:25 And now, behold, we 2009 [are] in thine hand: 3027 as it seemeth 5869 good 2896 and right 3477 unto thee to do 6213-2 unto us, do. 6213-3

9:26 And so did 6213-4 he unto them, and delivered 5337-55 them out of the hand 3027 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 that they slew 2026-1 them not.

9:27 And Joshua 3091 made 5414-4 them that day 3117 hewers 2404-6 of wood 6086 and drawers 7579-6 of water 4325 for the congregation, 5712 and for the altar 4196 of the LORD, 3068 even unto this day, 3117 in the place 4725 which he should choose. 977-4

10:1 Now it came to pass, when Adonizedek 139 king 4428 of Jerusalem 3389 had heard 8085-2 how 3588 Joshua 3091 had taken 3920-1 Ai, 5857 and had utterly destroyed 2763-55 it; as he had done 6213-1 to Jericho 3405 and her king, 4428 so he had done 6213-1 to Ai 5857 and her king; 4428 and how the inhabitants 3427-6 of Gibeon 1391 had made peace 7999-52 with Israel, 3478 and were among 7130 them;

10:2 That they feared 3372-4 greatly, 3966 because Gibeon 1391 [was] a great 1419 city, 5892 as one 259 of the royal 4467 cities, 5892 and because it [was] greater 1419 than Ai, 5857 and all the men 582 thereof [were] mighty. 1368

10:3 Wherefore Adonizedek 139 king 4428 of Jerusalem 3389 sent 7971-4 unto Hoham 1944 king 4428 of Hebron, 2275 and unto Piram 6502 king 4428 of Jarmuth, 3412 and unto Japhia 3309 king 4428 of Lachish, 3923 and unto Debir 1688 king 4428 of Eglon, 5700 saying, 559-2

10:4 Come up 5927-3 unto me, and help 5826-3 me, that we may smite 5221-55 Gibeon: 1391 for it hath made peace 7999-52 with Joshua 3091 and with the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

10:5 Therefore the five 2568 kings 4428 of the Amorites, 567 the king 4428 of Jerusalem, 3389 the king 4428 of Hebron, 2275 the king 4428 of Jarmuth, 3412 the king 4428 of Lachish, 3923 the king 4428 of Eglon, 5700 gathered 622-11 themselves together, and went up, 5927-4 they and all their hosts, 4264 and encamped 2583-4 before Gibeon, 1391 and made war 3898-11 against it.

10:6 And the men 582 of Gibeon 1391 sent 7971-4 unto Joshua 3091 to the camp 4264 to Gilgal, 1537 saying, 559-2 Slack 7503-55 not thy hand 3027 from thy servants; 5650 come up 5927-3 to us quickly, 4120 and save 3467-54 us, and help 5826-3 us: for all the kings 4428 of the Amorites 567 that dwell 3427-6 in the mountains 2022 are gathered together 6908-8 against us.

10:7 So Joshua 3091 ascended 5927-4 from Gilgal, 1537 he, and all the people 5971 of war 4421 with him, and all the mighty 1368 men of valour. 2428

10:8 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Joshua, 3091 Fear 3372-4 them not: for I have delivered 5414-1 them into thine hand; 3027 there shall not a man 376 of them stand 5975-4 before 6440 thee.

10:9 Joshua 3091 therefore came 935-4 unto them suddenly, 6597 [and] went up 5927-1 from Gilgal 1537 all night. 3915

10:10 And the LORD 3068 discomfited 2000-4 them before 6440 Israel, 3478 and slew 5221-55 them with a great 1419 slaughter 4347 at Gibeon, 1391 and chased 7291-4 them along the way 1870 that goeth up 4608 to Bethhoron, 1032 and smote 5221-55 them to Azekah, 5825 and unto Makkedah. 4719

10:11 And it came to pass, as they fled 5127-2 from before 6440 Israel, 3478 [and] were in the going down 4174 to Bethhoron, 1032 that the LORD 3068 cast down 7993-52 great 1419 stones 68 from heaven 8064 upon them unto Azekah, 5825 and they died: 4191-4 [they were] more 7227 which died 4191-1 with hailstones 1259 68 than [they] whom 834 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 slew 2026-1 with the sword. 2719

10:12 Then spake 1696-17 Joshua 3091 to the LORD 3068 in the day 3117 when the LORD 3068 delivered up 5414-2 the Amorites 567 before 6440 the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and he said 559-4 in the sight 5869 of Israel, 3478 Sun, 8121 stand thou still 1826-3 upon Gibeon; 1391 and thou, Moon, 3394 in the valley 6010 of Ajalon. 357

10:13 And the sun 8121 stood still, 1826-4 and the moon 3394 stayed, 5975-1 until the people 1471 had avenged 5358-4 themselves upon their enemies. 341-6 [Is] not this 1931 written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of Jasher? 3477 So the sun 8121 stood still 5975-4 in the midst 2677 of heaven, 8064 and hasted 213-1 not to go down 935-2 about a whole 8549 day. 3117

10:14 And there was no day 3117 like that before 6440 it or after 310 it, that the LORD 3068 hearkened 8085-2 unto the voice 6963 of a man: 376 for the LORD 3068 fought 3898-12 for Israel. 3478

10:15 And Joshua 3091 returned, 7725-4 and all Israel 3478 with him, unto the camp 4264 to Gilgal. 1537

10:16 But these five 2568 kings 4428 fled, 5127-4 and hid 2244-11 themselves in a cave 4631 at Makkedah. 4719

10:17 And it was told 5046-93 Joshua, 3091 saying, 559-2 The five 2568 kings 4428 are found 4672-8 hid 2244-12 in a cave 4631 at Makkedah. 4719

10:18 And Joshua 3091 said, 559-4 Roll 1556-3 great 1419 stones 68 upon the mouth 6310 of the cave, 4631 and set 6485-54 men 582 by it for to keep 8104-2 them:

10:19 And stay 5975-4 ye not, [but] pursue 7291-3 after 310 your enemies, 341-6 and smite the hindmost 2179-14 of them; suffer 5414-4 them not to enter 935-2 into their cities: 5892 for the LORD 3068 your God 430 hath delivered 5414-1 them into your hand. 3027

10:20 And it came to pass, when Joshua 3091 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 had made an end 3615-15 of slaying 5221-53 them with a very 3966 great 1419 slaughter, 4347 till they were consumed, 8552-2 that the rest 8300 [which] remained 8277-1 of them entered 935-4 into fenced 4013 cities. 5892

10:21 And all the people 5971 returned 7725-4 to the camp 4264 to Joshua 3091 at Makkedah 4719 in peace: 7965 none moved 2782-1 his tongue 3956 against any 376 of the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

10:22 Then said 559-4 Joshua, 3091 Open 6605-3 the mouth 6310 of the cave, 4631 and bring out 3318-54 those five 2568 kings 4428 unto me out of the cave. 4631

10:23 And they did 6213-4 so, and brought forth 3318-55 those five 2568 kings 4428 unto him out of the cave, 4631 the king 4428 of Jerusalem, 3389 the king 4428 of Hebron, 2275 the king 4428 of Jarmuth, 3412 the king 4428 of Lachish, 3923 [and] the king 4428 of Eglon. 5700

10:24 And it came to pass, when they brought out 3318-53 those kings 4428 unto Joshua, 3091 that Joshua 3091 called 7121-4 for all the men 376 of Israel, 3478 and said 559-4 unto the captains 7101 of the men 582 of war 4421 which went 1980-1 with him, Come near, 7126-3 put 7760-3 your feet 7272 upon the necks 6677 of these kings. 4428 And they came near, 7126-4 and put 7760-4 their feet 7272 upon the necks 6677 of them.

10:25 And Joshua 3091 said 559-4 unto them, Fear 3372-4 not, nor be dismayed, 2865-11 be strong 2388-3 and of good courage: 553-3 for thus shall the LORD 3068 do 6213-4 to all your enemies 341-6 against whom ye fight. 3898-12

10:26 And afterward 310 Joshua 3091 smote 5221-55 them, and slew 4191-55 them, and hanged 8518-4 them on five 2568 trees: 6086 and they were hanging 8518-7 upon the trees 6086 until the evening. 6153

10:27 And it came to pass at the time 6256 of the going down 935-2 of the sun, 8121 [that] Joshua 3091 commanded, 6680-14 and they took them down 3381-55 off the trees, 6086 and cast 7993-55 them into the cave 4631 wherein they had been hid, 2244-8 and laid 7760-4 great 1419 stones 68 in the cave's 4631 mouth, 6310 [which remain] until this very 6106 day. 3117

10:28 And that day 3117 Joshua 3091 took 3920-1 Makkedah, 4719 and smote 5221-55 it with the edge 6310 of the sword, 2719 and the king 4428 thereof he utterly destroyed, 2763-52 them, and all the souls 5315 that [were] therein; he let 7604-52 none remain: 8300 and he did 6213-4 to the king 4428 of Makkedah 4719 as he did 6213-1 unto the king 4428 of Jericho. 3405

10:29 Then Joshua 3091 passed 5674-4 from Makkedah, 4719 and all Israel 3478 with him, unto Libnah, 3841 and fought 3898-11 against Libnah: 3841

10:30 And the LORD 3068 delivered 5414-4 it also, and the king 4428 thereof, into the hand 3027 of Israel; 3478 and he smote 5221-55 it with the edge 6310 of the sword, 2719 and all the souls 5315 that [were] therein; he let 7604-52 none remain 8300 in it; but did 6213-4 unto the king 4428 thereof as he did 6213-1 unto the king 4428 of Jericho. 3405

10:31 And Joshua 3091 passed 5674-4 from Libnah, 3841 and all Israel 3478 with him, unto Lachish, 3923 and encamped 2583-4 against it, and fought 3898-11 against it:

10:32 And the LORD 3068 delivered 5414-4 Lachish 3923 into the hand 3027 of Israel, 3478 which took 3920-4 it on the second 8145 day, 3117 and smote 5221-55 it with the edge 6310 of the sword, 2719 and all the souls 5315 that [were] therein, according to all that he had done 6213-1 to Libnah. 3841

10:33 Then Horam 2036 king 4428 of Gezer 1507 came up 5927-1 to help 5826-2 Lachish; 3923 and Joshua 3091 smote 5221-55 him and his people, 5971 until he had left 7604-52 him none remaining. 8300

10:34 And from Lachish 3923 Joshua 3091 passed 5674-4 unto Eglon, 5700 and all Israel 3478 with him; and they encamped 2583-4 against it, and fought 3898-11 against it:

10:35 And they took 3920-4 it on that day, 3117 and smote 5221-55 it with the edge 6310 of the sword, 2719 and all the souls 5315 that [were] therein he utterly destroyed 2763-52 that day, 3117 according to all that he had done 6213-1 to Lachish. 3923

10:36 And Joshua 3091 went up 5927-4 from Eglon, 5700 and all Israel 3478 with him, unto Hebron; 2275 and they fought 3898-11 against it:

10:37 And they took 3920-4 it, and smote 5221-55 it with the edge 6310 of the sword, 2719 and the king 4428 thereof, and all the cities 5892 thereof, and all the souls 5315 that [were] therein; he left 7604-52 none remaining, 8300 according to all that he had done 6213-1 to Eglon; 5700 but destroyed it utterly, 2763-55 and all the souls 5315 that [were] therein.

10:38 And Joshua 3091 returned, 7725-4 and all Israel 3478 with him, to Debir; 1688 and fought 3898-11 against it:

10:39 And he took 3920-4 it, and the king 4428 thereof, and all the cities 5892 thereof; and they smote 5221-55 them with the edge 6310 of the sword, 2719 and utterly destroyed 2763-55 all the souls 5315 that [were] therein; he left 7604-52 none remaining: 8300 as he had done 6213-1 to Hebron, 2275 so he did 6213-1 to Debir, 1688 and to the king 4428 thereof; as he had done 6213-1 also to Libnah, 3841 and to her king. 4428

10:40 So Joshua 3091 smote 5221-55 all the country 776 of the hills, 2022 and of the south, 5045 and of the vale, 8219 and of the springs, 794 and all their kings: 4428 he left 7604-52 none remaining, 8300 but utterly destroyed 2763-52 all that breathed, 5397 as the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 commanded. 6680-14

10:41 And Joshua 3091 smote 5221-55 them from Kadeshbarnea 6947 even unto Gaza, 5804 and all the country 776 of Goshen, 1657 even unto Gibeon. 1391

10:42 And all these kings 4428 and their land 776 did Joshua 3091 take 3920-1 at one 259 time, 6471 because the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 fought 3898-12 for Israel. 3478

10:43 And Joshua 3091 returned, 7725-4 and all Israel 3478 with him, unto the camp 4264 to Gilgal. 1537

11:1 And it came to pass, when Jabin 2985 king 4428 of Hazor 2674 had heard 8085-2 [those things], that he sent 7971-4 to Jobab 3103 king 4428 of Madon, 4068 and to the king 4428 of Shimron, 8110 and to the king 4428 of Achshaph, 407

11:2 And to the kings 4428 that [were] on the north 6828 of the mountains, 2022 and of the plains 6160 south 5045 of Chinneroth, 3672 and in the valley, 8219 and in the borders 5299 of Dor 1756 on the west, 3220

11:3 [And to] the Canaanite 3669 on the east 4217 and on the west, 3220 and [to] the Amorite, 567 and the Hittite, 2850 and the Perizzite, 6522 and the Jebusite 2983 in the mountains, 2022 and [to] the Hivite 2340 under Hermon 2768 in the land 776 of Mizpeh. 4709

11:4 And they went out, 3318-4 they and all their hosts 4264 with them, much 7227 people, 5971 even as the sand 2344 that [is] upon the sea 3220 shore 8193 in multitude, 7230 with horses 5483 and chariots 7393 very 3966 many. 7227

11:5 And when all these kings 4428 were met together, 3259-11 they came 935-4 and pitched 2583-4 together 3162 at the waters 4325 of Merom, 4792 to fight 3898-9 against Israel. 3478

11:6 And the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto Joshua, 3091 Be not afraid 3372-4 because 6440 of them: for to morrow 4279 about this time 6256 will I deliver 5414-6 them up all slain 2491 before 6440 Israel: 3478 thou shalt hough 6131-17 their horses, 5483 and burn 8313-4 their chariots 4818 with fire. 784

11:7 So Joshua 3091 came, 935-4 and all the people 5971 of war 4421 with him, against them by the waters 4325 of Merom 4792 suddenly; 6597 and they fell 5307-4 upon them.

11:8 And the LORD 3068 delivered 5414-4 them into the hand 3027 of Israel, 3478 who smote 5221-55 them, and chased 7291-4 them unto great 7227 Zidon, 6721 and unto Misrephothmaim, 4956 and unto the valley 1237 of Mizpeh 4708 eastward; 4217 and they smote 5221-55 them, until they left 7604-52 them none remaining. 8300

11:9 And Joshua 3091 did 6213-4 unto them as the LORD 3068 bade 559-1 him: he houghed 6131-14 their horses, 5483 and burnt 8313-1 their chariots 4818 with fire. 784

11:10 And Joshua 3091 at that time 6256 turned back, 7725-4 and took 3920-4 Hazor, 2674 and smote 5221-52 the king 4428 thereof with the sword: 2719 for Hazor 2674 beforetime 6440 was the head 7218 of all those kingdoms. 4467

11:11 And they smote 5221-55 all the souls 5315 that [were] therein with the edge 6310 of the sword, 2719 utterly destroying 2763-53 [them]: there was not any left 3498-8 to breathe: 5397 and he burnt 8313-1 Hazor 2674 with fire. 784

11:12 And all the cities 5892 of those kings, 4428 and all the kings 4428 of them, did Joshua 3091 take, 3920-1 and smote 5221-55 them with the edge 6310 of the sword, 2719 [and] he utterly destroyed 2763-52 them, as Moses 4872 the servant 5650 of the LORD 3068 commanded. 6680-14

11:13 But [as for] the cities 5892 that stood 5975-6 still in their strength, 8510 Israel 3478 burned 8313-1 none of them, save 2108 Hazor 2674 only; [that] did Joshua 3091 burn. 8313-1

11:14 And all the spoil 7998 of these cities, 5892 and the cattle, 929 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 took for a prey 962-1 unto themselves; but every man 120 they smote 5221-52 with the edge 6310 of the sword, 2719 until they had destroyed 8045-53 them, neither left 7604-52 they any to breathe. 5397

11:15 As the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses 4872 his servant, 5650 so did Moses 4872 command 6680-14 Joshua, 3091 and so did 6213-1 Joshua; 3091 he left nothing 1697 undone 5493-52 of all that the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

11:16 So Joshua 3091 took 3947-4 all that land, 776 the hills, 2022 and all the south country, 5045 and all the land 776 of Goshen, 1657 and the valley, 8219 and the plain, 6160 and the mountain 2022 of Israel, 3478 and the valley 8219 of the same;

11:17 [Even] from the mount 2022 Halak, 2509|2510 that goeth up 5927-6 to Seir, 8165 even unto Baalgad 1171 in the valley 1237 of Lebanon 3844 under mount 2022 Hermon: 2768 and all their kings 4428 he took, 3920-1 and smote 5221-55 them, and slew 4191-55 them.

11:18 Joshua 3091 made 6213-1 war 4421 a long 7227 time 3117 with all those kings. 4428

11:19 There was not a city 5892 that made peace 7999-52 with the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 save the Hivites 2340 the inhabitants 3427-6 of Gibeon: 1391 all [other] they took 3947-1 in battle. 4421

11:20 For it was of the LORD 3068 to harden 2388-15 their hearts, 3820 that they should come against 7125-2 Israel 3478 in battle, 4421 that he might destroy them utterly, 2763-53 [and] that they might have no favour, 8467 but that he might destroy 8045-53 them, as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses. 4872

11:21 And at that time 6256 came 935-4 Joshua, 3091 and cut off 3772-55 the Anakims 6062 from the mountains, 2022 from Hebron, 2275 from Debir, 1688 from Anab, 6024 and from all the mountains 2022 of Judah, 3063 and from all the mountains 2022 of Israel: 3478 Joshua 3091 destroyed them utterly 2763-52 with their cities. 5892

11:22 There was none of the Anakims 6062 left 3498-8 in the land 776 of the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 only in Gaza, 5804 in Gath, 1661 and in Ashdod, 795 there remained. 7604-8

11:23 So Joshua 3091 took 3947-4 the whole land, 776 according to all that the LORD 3068 said 1696-14 unto Moses; 4872 and Joshua 3091 gave 5414-4 it for an inheritance 5159 unto Israel 3478 according to their divisions 4256 by their tribes. 7626 And the land 776 rested 8252-1 from war. 4421

12:1 Now these [are] the kings 4428 of the land, 776 which the children 1121 of Israel 3478 smote, 5221-52 and possessed 3423-4 their land 776 on the other side 5676 Jordan 3383 toward the rising 4217 of the sun, 8121 from the river 5158 Arnon 769 unto mount 2022 Hermon, 2768 and all the plain 6160 on the east: 4217

12:2 Sihon 5511 king 4428 of the Amorites, 567 who dwelt 3427-6 in Heshbon, 2809 [and] ruled 4910-6 from Aroer, 6177 which [is] upon the bank 8193 of the river 5158 Arnon, 769 and from the middle 8432 of the river, 5158 and from half 2677 Gilead, 1568 even unto the river 5158 Jabbok, 2999 [which is] the border 1366 of the children 1121 of Ammon; 5983

12:3 And from the plain 6160 to the sea 3220 of Chinneroth 3672 on the east, 4217 and unto the sea 3220 of the plain, 6160 [even] the salt 4417 sea 3220 on the east, 4217 the way 1870 to Bethjeshimoth; 1020 and from the south, 8486|8487 under Ashdothpisgah: 794|6449|798

12:4 And the coast 1366 of Og 5747 king 4428 of Bashan, 1316 [which was] of the remnant 3499 of the giants, 7497 that dwelt 3427-6 at Ashtaroth 6252 and at Edrei, 154

12:5 And reigned 4910-6 in mount 2022 Hermon, 2768 and in Salcah, 5548 and in all Bashan, 1316 unto the border 1366 of the Geshurites 1651 and the Maachathites, 4602 and half 2677 Gilead, 1568 the border 1366 of Sihon 5511 king 4428 of Heshbon. 2809

12:6 Them did Moses 4872 the servant 5650 of the LORD 3068 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 smite: 5221-52 and Moses 4872 the servant 5650 of the LORD 3068 gave 5414-4 it [for] a possession 3425 unto the Reubenites, 7206 and the Gadites, 1425 and the half 2677 tribe 7626 of Manasseh. 4519

12:7 And these [are] the kings 4428 of the country 776 which Joshua 3091 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 smote 5221-52 on this side 5676 Jordan 3383 on the west, 3220 from Baalgad 1171 in the valley 1237 of Lebanon 3844 even unto the mount 2022 Halak, 2509|2510 that goeth up 5927-6 to Seir; 8165 which Joshua 3091 gave 5414-4 unto the tribes 7626 of Israel 3478 [for] a possession 3425 according to their divisions; 4256

12:8 In the mountains, 2022 and in the valleys, 8219 and in the plains, 6160 and in the springs, 794 and in the wilderness, 4057 and in the south country; 5045 the Hittites, 2850 the Amorites, 567 and the Canaanites, 3669 the Perizzites, 6522 the Hivites, 2340 and the Jebusites: 2983

12:9 The king 4428 of Jericho, 3405 one; 259 the king 4428 of Ai, 5857 which [is] beside 6654 Bethel, 1008 one; 259

12:10 The king 4428 of Jerusalem, 3389 one; 259 the king 4428 of Hebron, 2275 one; 259

12:11 The king 4428 of Jarmuth, 3412 one; 259 the king 4428 of Lachish, 3923 one; 259

12:12 The king 4428 of Eglon, 5700 one; 259 the king 4428 of Gezer, 1507 one; 259

12:13 The king 4428 of Debir, 1688 one; 259 the king 4428 of Geder, 1445 one; 259

12:14 The king 4428 of Hormah, 2767 one; 259 the king 4428 of Arad, 6166 one; 259

12:15 The king 4428 of Libnah, 3841 one; 259 the king 4428 of Adullam, 5725 one; 259

12:16 The king 4428 of Makkedah, 4719 one; 259 the king 4428 of Bethel, 1008 one; 259

12:17 The king 4428 of Tappuah, 8599 one; 259 the king 4428 of Hepher, 2660 one; 259

12:18 The king 4428 of Aphek, 663 one; 259 the king 4428 of Lasharon, 8289 one; 259

12:19 The king 4428 of Madon, 4068 one; 259 the king 4428 of Hazor, 2674 one; 259

12:20 The king 4428 of Shimronmeron, 8112 one; 259 the king 4428 of Achshaph, 407 one; 259

12:21 The king 4428 of Taanach, 8590 one; 259 the king 4428 of Megiddo, 4023 one; 259

12:22 The king 4428 of Kedesh, 6943 one; 259 the king 4428 of Jokneam 3362 of Carmel, 3760 one; 259

12:23 The king 4428 of Dor 1756 in the coast 5299 of Dor, 1756 one; 259 the king 4428 of the nations 1471 of Gilgal, 1537 one; 259

12:24 The king 4428 of Tirzah, 8656 one: 259 all the kings 4428 thirty 7970 and one. 259

13:1 Now Joshua 3091 was old 2204-1 [and] stricken 935-1 in years; 3117 and the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto him, Thou art old 2204-1 [and] stricken 935-1 in years, 3117 and there remaineth 7604-8 yet very 3966 much 7235-53 land 776 to be possessed. 3423-2

13:2 This [is] the land 776 that yet remaineth: 7604-12 all the borders 1552 of the Philistines, 6430 and all Geshuri, 1651

13:3 From Sihor, 7883 which [is] before 6440 Egypt, 4714 even unto the borders 1366 of Ekron 6138 northward, 6828 [which] is counted 2803-11 to the Canaanite: 3669 five 2568 lords 5633 of the Philistines; 6430 the Gazathites, 5841 and the Ashdothites, 796 the Eshkalonites, 832 the Gittites, 1663 and the Ekronites; 6139 also the Avites: 5761

13:4 From the south, 8486|8487 all the land 776 of the Canaanites, 3669 and Mearah 4632|4631 that [is] beside the Sidonians, 6722 unto Aphek, 663 to the borders 1366 of the Amorites: 567

13:5 And the land 776 of the Giblites, 1382 and all Lebanon, 3844 toward the sunrising, 4217 8121 from Baalgad 1171 under mount 2022 Hermon 2768 unto the entering into 935-2 Hamath. 2574

13:6 All the inhabitants 3427-6 of the hill country 2022 from Lebanon 3844 unto Misrephothmaim, 4956 [and] all the Sidonians, 6722 them will I drive out 3423-55 from before 6440 the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 only divide thou it by lot 5307-54 unto the Israelites 3478 for an inheritance, 5159 as I have commanded 6680-14 thee.

13:7 Now therefore divide 2505-16 this land 776 for an inheritance 5159 unto the nine 8672 tribes, 7626 and the half 2677 tribe 7626 of Manasseh, 4519

13:8 With whom the Reubenites 7206 and the Gadites 1425 have received 3947-1 their inheritance, 5159 which Moses 4872 gave 5414-1 them, beyond 5676 Jordan 3383 eastward, 4217 [even] as Moses 4872 the servant 5650 of the LORD 3068 gave 5414-1 them;

13:9 From Aroer, 6177 that [is] upon the bank 8193 of the river 5158 Arnon, 769 and the city 5892 that [is] in the midst 8432 of the river, 5158 and all the plain 4334 of Medeba 4311 unto Dibon; 1769

13:10 And all the cities 5892 of Sihon 5511 king 4428 of the Amorites, 567 which reigned 4427-1 in Heshbon, 2809 unto the border 1366 of the children 1121 of Ammon; 5983

13:11 And Gilead, 1568 and the border 1366 of the Geshurites 1651 and Maachathites, 4602 and all mount 2022 Hermon, 2768 and all Bashan 1316 unto Salcah; 5548

13:12 All the kingdom 4468 of Og 5747 in Bashan, 1316 which reigned 4427-1 in Ashtaroth 6252 and in Edrei, 154 who remained 7604-8 of the remnant 3499 of the giants: 7497 for these did Moses 4872 smite, 5221-55 and cast them out. 3423-55

13:13 Nevertheless the children 1121 of Israel 3478 expelled 3423-52 not the Geshurites, 1651 nor the Maachathites: 4602 but the Geshurites 1650 and the Maachathites 4601 dwell 3427-4 among 7130 the Israelites 3478 until this day. 3117

13:14 Only unto the tribe 7626 of Levi 3878 he gave 5414-1 none inheritance; 5159 the sacrifices of the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 made by fire 801 [are] their inheritance, 5159 as he said 1696-14 unto them.

13:15 And Moses 4872 gave 5414-4 unto the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Reuben 7205 [inheritance] according to their families. 4940

13:16 And their coast 1366 was from Aroer, 6177 that [is] on the bank 8193 of the river 5158 Arnon, 769 and the city 5892 that [is] in the midst 8432 of the river, 5158 and all the plain 4334 by Medeba; 4311

13:17 Heshbon, 2809 and all her cities 5892 that [are] in the plain; 4334 Dibon, 1769 and Bamothbaal, 1120|1116 and Bethbaalmeon, 1010

13:18 And Jahazah, 3096 and Kedemoth, 6932 and Mephaath, 4158

13:19 And Kirjathaim, 7156 and Sibmah, 7643 and Zarethshahar 6890 in the mount 2022 of the valley, 6010

13:20 And Bethpeor, 1047 and Ashdothpisgah, 794|6449|798 and Bethjeshimoth, 1020

13:21 And all the cities 5892 of the plain, 4334 and all the kingdom 4468 of Sihon 5511 king 4428 of the Amorites, 567 which reigned 4427-1 in Heshbon, 2809 whom Moses 4872 smote 5221-52 with the princes 5387 of Midian, 4080 Evi, 189 and Rekem, 7552 and Zur, 6698 and Hur, 2354 and Reba, 7254 [which were] dukes 5257 of Sihon, 5511 dwelling 3427-6 in the country. 776

13:22 Balaam 1109 also the son 1121 of Beor, 1160 the soothsayer, 7080-6 did the children 1121 of Israel 3478 slay 2026-1 with the sword 2719 among them 413 that were slain 2491 by them.

13:23 And the border 1366 of the children 1121 of Reuben 7205 was Jordan, 3383 and the border 1366 [thereof]. This [was] the inheritance 5159 of the children 1121 of Reuben 7205 after their families, 4940 the cities 5892 and the villages 2691 thereof.

13:24 And Moses 4872 gave 5414-4 [inheritance] unto the tribe 4294 of Gad, 1410 [even] unto the children 1121 of Gad 1410 according to their families. 4940

13:25 And their coast 1366 was Jazer, 3270 and all the cities 5892 of Gilead, 1568 and half 2677 the land 776 of the children 1121 of Ammon, 5983 unto Aroer 6177 that [is] before 6440 Rabbah; 7237

13:26 And from Heshbon 2809 unto Ramathmizpeh, 7434 and Betonim; 993 and from Mahanaim 4266 unto the border 1366 of Debir; 1688

13:27 And in the valley, 6010 Betharam, 1027 and Bethnimrah, 1039 and Succoth, 5523 and Zaphon, 6829 the rest 3499 of the kingdom 4468 of Sihon 5511 king 4428 of Heshbon, 2809 Jordan 3383 and [his] border, 1366 [even] unto the edge 7097 of the sea 3220 of Chinnereth 3672 on the other side 5676 Jordan 3383 eastward. 4217

13:28 This [is] the inheritance 5159 of the children 1121 of Gad 1410 after their families, 4940 the cities, 5892 and their villages. 2691

13:29 And Moses 4872 gave 5414-4 [inheritance] unto the half 2677 tribe 7626 of Manasseh: 4519 and [this] was [the possession] of the half 2677 tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Manasseh 4519 by their families. 4940

13:30 And their coast 1366 was from Mahanaim, 4266 all Bashan, 1316 all the kingdom 4468 of Og 5747 king 4428 of Bashan, 1316 and all the towns 2333 of Jair, 2971 which [are] in Bashan, 1316 threescore 8346 cities: 5892

13:31 And half 2677 Gilead, 1568 and Ashtaroth, 6252 and Edrei, 154 cities 5892 of the kingdom 4468 of Og 5747 in Bashan, 1316 [were pertaining] unto the children 1121 of Machir 4353 the son 1121 of Manasseh, 4519 [even] to the one half 2677 of the children 1121 of Machir 4353 by their families. 4940

13:32 These [are the countries] which Moses 4872 did distribute for inheritance 5157-14 in the plains 6160 of Moab, 4124 on the other side 5676 Jordan, 3383 by Jericho, 3405 eastward. 4217

13:33 But unto the tribe 7626 of Levi 3878 Moses 4872 gave 5414-1 not [any] inheritance: 5159 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 [was] their inheritance, 5159 as he said 1696-14 unto them.

14:1 And these [are the countries] which the children 1121 of Israel 3478 inherited 5157-1 in the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 which Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 and Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun, 5126 and the heads 7218 of the fathers 1 of the tribes 4294 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 distributed for inheritance 5157-14 to them.

14:2 By lot 1486 [was] their inheritance, 5159 as the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 by the hand 3027 of Moses, 4872 for the nine 8672 tribes, 4294 and [for] the half 2677 tribe. 4294

14:3 For Moses 4872 had given 5414-1 the inheritance 5159 of two 8147 tribes 4294 and an half 2677 tribe 4294 on the other side 5676 Jordan: 3383 but unto the Levites 3881 he gave 5414-1 none inheritance 5159 among 8432 them.

14:4 For the children 1121 of Joseph 3130 were two 8147 tribes, 4294 Manasseh 4519 and Ephraim: 669 therefore they gave 5414-1 no part 2506 unto the Levites 3881 in the land, 776 save cities 5892 to dwell 3427-2 [in], with their suburbs 4054 for their cattle 4735 and for their substance. 7075

14:5 As the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses, 4872 so the children 1121 of Israel 3478 did, 6213-1 and they divided 2505-4 the land. 776

14:6 Then the children 1121 of Judah 3063 came 5066-4 unto Joshua 3091 in Gilgal: 1537 and Caleb 3612 the son 1121 of Jephunneh 3312 the Kenezite 7074 said 559-4 unto him, Thou knowest 3045-1 the thing 1697 that the LORD 3068 said 1696-14 unto Moses 4872 the man 376 of God 430 concerning me 182 and thee 182 in Kadeshbarnea. 6947

14:7 Forty 705 years 8141 old 1121 [was] I when Moses 4872 the servant 5650 of the LORD 3068 sent 7971-2 me from Kadeshbarnea 6947 to espy out 7270-15 the land; 776 and I brought him word 1697 again 7725-55 as [it was] in mine heart. 3824

14:8 Nevertheless my brethren 251 that went up 5927-1 with me made the heart 3820 of the people 5971 melt: 4529-52 but I wholly 4390-14 followed 310 the LORD 3068 my God. 430

14:9 And Moses 4872 sware 7650-11 on that day, 3117 saying, 559-2 Surely the land 776 whereon thy feet 7272 have trodden 1869-1 shall be thine inheritance, 5159 and thy children's 1121 for 5704 ever, 5769 because thou hast wholly 4390-14 followed 310 the LORD 3068 my God. 430

14:10 And now, behold, the LORD 3068 hath kept me alive, 2421-52 as he said, 1696-14 these forty 705 and five 2568 years, 8141 even since 227 the LORD 3068 spake 1696-14 this word 1697 unto Moses, 4872 while [the children of] Israel 3478 wandered 1980-1 in the wilderness: 4057 and now, lo, I [am] this day 3117 fourscore 8084 and five 2568 years 8141 old. 1121

14:11 As yet I [am as] strong 2389 this day 3117 as [I was] in the day 3117 that Moses 4872 sent 7971-2 me: as my strength 3581 [was] then, even so [is] my strength 3581 now, for war, 4421 both to go out, 3318-2 and to come in. 935-2

14:12 Now therefore give 5414-3 me this mountain, 2022 whereof the LORD 3068 spake 1696-14 in that day; 3117 for thou heardest 8085-1 in that day 3117 how the Anakims 6062 [were] there, and [that] the cities 5892 [were] great 1419 [and] fenced: 1219-7 if so be 194 the LORD 3068 [will be] with me, 854 then I shall be able to drive them out, 3423-52 as the LORD 3068 said. 1696-14

14:13 And Joshua 3091 blessed 1288-17 him, and gave 5414-4 unto Caleb 3612 the son 1121 of Jephunneh 3312 Hebron 2275 for an inheritance. 5159

14:14 Hebron 2275 therefore became the inheritance 5159 of Caleb 3612 the son 1121 of Jephunneh 3312 the Kenezite 7074 unto this day, 3117 because that he wholly 4390-14 followed 310 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel. 3478

14:15 And the name 8034 of Hebron 2275 before 6440 [was] Kirjatharba; 7153|704 [which Arba was] a great 1419 man 120 among the Anakims. 6062 And the land 776 had rest 8252-1 from war. 4421

15:1 [This] then was the lot 1486 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Judah 3063 by their families; 4940 [even] to the border 1366 of Edom 123 the wilderness 4057 of Zin 6790 southward 5045 [was] the uttermost part 7097 of the south 8486|8487 coast.

15:2 And their south 5045 border 1366 was from the shore 7097 of the salt 4417 sea, 3220 from the bay 3956 that looketh 6437-6 southward: 5045

15:3 And it went out 3318-1 to the south side 5045 to Maalehacrabbim, 4608|6137|4610 and passed along 5674-1 to Zin, 6790 and ascended up 5927-1 on the south side 5045 unto Kadeshbarnea, 6947 and passed along 5674-1 to Hezron, 2696 and went up 5927-1 to Adar, 146 and fetched a compass 5437-8 to Karkaa: 7173

15:4 [From thence] it passed 5674-1 toward Azmon, 6111 and went out 3318-1 unto the river 5158 of Egypt; 4714 and the goings out 8444 of that coast 1366 were at the sea: 3220 this shall be your south 5045 coast. 1366

15:5 And the east 6924 border 1366 [was] the salt 4417 sea, 3220 [even] unto the end 7097 of Jordan. 3383 And [their] border 1366 in the north 6828 quarter 6285 [was] from the bay 3956 of the sea 3220 at the uttermost part 7097 of Jordan: 3383

15:6 And the border 1366 went up 5927-1 to Bethhogla, 1031 and passed along 5674-1 by the north 6828 of Betharabah; 1026 and the border 1366 went up 5927-1 to the stone 68 of Bohan 932 the son 1121 of Reuben: 7205

15:7 And the border 1366 went up 5927-1 toward Debir 1688 from the valley 6010 of Achor, 5911 and so northward, 6828 looking 6437-6 toward Gilgal, 1537 that [is] before 5227 the going up 4608 to Adummim, 131 which [is] on the south side 5045 of the river: 5158 and the border 1366 passed 5674-1 toward the waters 4325 of Enshemesh, 5885 and the goings out 8444 thereof were at Enrogel: 5883

15:8 And the border 1366 went up 5927-1 by the valley 1516 of the son 1121 of Hinnom 2011 unto the south 5045 side 3802 of the Jebusite; 2983 the same [is] Jerusalem: 3389 and the border 1366 went up 5927-1 to the top 7218 of the mountain 2022 that [lieth] before 6440 the valley 1516 of Hinnom 2011 westward, 3220 which [is] at the end 7097 of the valley 6010 of the giants 7497 northward: 6828

15:9 And the border 1366 was drawn 8388-1 from the top 7218 of the hill 2022 unto the fountain 4599 of the water 4325 of Nephtoah, 5318 and went out 3318-1 to the cities 5892 of mount 2022 Ephron; 6085 and the border 1366 was drawn 8388-1 to Baalah, 1173 which [is] Kirjathjearim: 7157

15:10 And the border 1366 compassed 5437-8 from Baalah 1173 westward 3220 unto mount 2022 Seir, 8165 and passed along 5674-1 unto the side 3802 of mount 2022 Jearim, 3297 which [is] Chesalon, 3693 on the north 6828 side, and went down 3381-1 to Bethshemesh, 1053 and passed on 5674-1 to Timnah: 8553

15:11 And the border 1366 went out 3318-1 unto the side 3802 of Ekron 6138 northward: 6828 and the border 1366 was drawn 8388-1 to Shicron, 7942 and passed along 5674-1 to mount 2022 Baalah, 1173 and went out 3318-1 unto Jabneel; 2995 and the goings out 8444 of the border 1366 were at the sea. 3220

15:12 And the west 3220 border 1366 [was] to the great 1419 sea, 3220 and the coast 1366 [thereof]. This [is] the coast 1366 of the children 1121 of Judah 3063 round about 5439 according to their families. 4940

15:13 And unto Caleb 3612 the son 1121 of Jephunneh 3312 he gave 5414-1 a part 2506 among 8432 the children 1121 of Judah, 3063 according 413 to the commandment 6310 of the LORD 3068 to Joshua, 3091 [even] the city of Arba 7151|704|7153 the father 1 of Anak, 6061 which [city is] Hebron. 2275

15:14 And Caleb 3612 drove 3423-55 thence the three 7969 sons 1121 of Anak, 6061 Sheshai, 8344 and Ahiman, 289 and Talmai, 8526 the children 3211 of Anak. 6061

15:15 And he went up 5927-4 thence to the inhabitants 3427-6 of Debir: 1688 and the name 8034 of Debir 1688 before 6440 [was] Kirjathsepher. 7158

15:16 And Caleb 3612 said, 559-4 He that smiteth 5221-55 Kirjathsepher, 7158 and taketh 3920-1 it, to him will I give 5414-1 Achsah 5915 my daughter 1323 to wife. 802

15:17 And Othniel 6274 the son 1121 of Kenaz, 7073 the brother 251 of Caleb, 3612 took 3920-4 it: and he gave 5414-4 him Achsah 5915 his daughter 1323 to wife. 802

15:18 And it came to pass, as she came 935-2 [unto him], that she moved 5496-55 him to ask 7592-2 of her father 1 a field: 7704 and she lighted 6795-4 off [her] ass; 2543 and Caleb 3612 said 559-4 unto her, What wouldest thou?

15:19 Who answered, 559-4 Give 5414-3 me a blessing; 1293 for thou hast given 5414-1 me a south 5045 land; 776 give 5414-1 me also springs 1543 of water. 4325 And he gave 5414-4 her the upper 5942 springs, 1543 and the nether 8482 springs. 1543

15:20 This [is] the inheritance 5159 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Judah 3063 according to their families. 4940

15:21 And the uttermost 7097 cities 5892 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Judah 3063 toward the coast 1366 of Edom 123 southward 5045 were Kabzeel, 6909 and Eder, 5740 and Jagur, 3017

16:1 And the lot 1486 of the children 1121 of Joseph 3130 fell 3318-4 from Jordan 3383 by Jericho, 3405 unto the water 4325 of Jericho 3405 on the east, 4217 to the wilderness 4057 that goeth up 5927-6 from Jericho 3405 throughout mount 2022 Bethel, 1008

16:2 And goeth out 3318-1 from Bethel 1008 to Luz, 3870 and passeth along 5674-1 unto the borders 1366 of Archi 757 to Ataroth, 5852

16:3 And goeth down 3381-1 westward 3220 to the coast 1366 of Japhleti, 3311 unto the coast 1366 of Bethhoron 1032 the nether, 8481 and to Gezer: 1507 and the goings out 8444 thereof are at the sea. 3220

16:4 So the children 1121 of Joseph, 3130 Manasseh 4519 and Ephraim, 669 took their inheritance. 5157-4

16:5 And the border 1366 of the children 1121 of Ephraim 669 according to their families 4940 was [thus]: even the border 1366 of their inheritance 5159 on the east side 4217 was Atarothaddar, 5853 unto Bethhoron 1032 the upper; 5945

16:6 And the border 1366 went out 3318-1 toward the sea 3220 to Michmethah 4366 on the north 6828 side; and the border 1366 went about 5437-8 eastward 4217 unto Taanathshiloh, 8387 and passed by 5674-1 it on the east 4217 to Janohah; 3239

16:7 And it went down 3381-1 from Janohah 3239 to Ataroth, 5852 and to Naarath, 5292 and came 6293-1 to Jericho, 3405 and went out 3318-1 at Jordan. 3383

16:8 The border 1366 went out 3212-4 from Tappuah 8599 westward 3220 unto the river 5158 Kanah; 7071 and the goings out 8444 thereof were at the sea. 3220 This [is] the inheritance 5159 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Ephraim 669 by their families. 4940

16:9 And the separate 3995 cities 5892 for the children 1121 of Ephraim 669 [were] among 8432 the inheritance 5159 of the children 1121 of Manasseh, 4519 all the cities 5892 with their villages. 2691

16:10 And they drave not out 3423-52 the Canaanites 3669 that dwelt 3427-6 in Gezer: 1507 but the Canaanites 3669 dwell 3427-4 among 7130 the Ephraimites 669 unto this day, 3117 and serve 5647-6 under tribute. 4522

17:1 There was also a lot 1486 for the tribe 4294 of Manasseh; 4519 for he [was] the firstborn 1060 of Joseph; 3130 [to wit], for Machir 4353 the firstborn 1060 of Manasseh, 4519 the father 1 of Gilead: 1568 because he was a man 376 of war, 4421 therefore he had Gilead 1568 and Bashan. 1316

17:2 There was also [a lot] for the rest 3498-12 of the children 1121 of Manasseh 4519 by their families; 4940 for the children 1121 of Abiezer, 44 and for the children 1121 of Helek, 2507 and for the children 1121 of Asriel, 844 and for the children 1121 of Shechem, 7928 and for the children 1121 of Hepher, 2660 and for the children 1121 of Shemida: 8061 these [were] the male 2145 children 1121 of Manasseh 4519 the son 1121 of Joseph 3130 by their families. 4940

17:3 But Zelophehad, 6765 the son 1121 of Hepher, 2660 the son 1121 of Gilead, 1568 the son 1121 of Machir, 4353 the son 1121 of Manasseh, 4519 had no sons, 1121 but daughters: 1323 and these [are] the names 8034 of his daughters, 1323 Mahlah, 4244 and Noah, 5270 Hoglah, 2295 Milcah, 4435 and Tirzah. 8656

17:4 And they came near 7126-4 before 6440 Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 and before 6440 Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun, 5126 and before 6440 the princes, 5387 saying, 559-2 The LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 Moses 4872 to give 5414-2 us an inheritance 5159 among 8432 our brethren. 251 Therefore according to the commandment 6310 of the LORD 3068 he gave 5414-4 them an inheritance 5159 among 8432 the brethren 251 of their father. 1

17:5 And there fell 5307-4 ten 6235 portions 2256 to Manasseh, 4519 beside the land 776 of Gilead 1568 and Bashan, 1316 which [were] on the other side 5676 Jordan; 3383

17:6 Because the daughters 1323 of Manasseh 4519 had 5157-1 an inheritance 5159 among 8432 his sons: 1121 and the rest 3498-12 of Manasseh's 4519 sons 1121 had the land 776 of Gilead. 1568

17:7 And the coast 1366 of Manasseh 4519 was from Asher 836 to Michmethah, 4366 that [lieth] before 6440 Shechem; 7927 and the border 1366 went along 1980-1 on the right hand 3225 unto the inhabitants 3427-6 of Entappuah. 5887

17:8 [Now] Manasseh 4519 had the land 776 of Tappuah: 8599 but Tappuah 8599 on the border 1366 of Manasseh 4519 [belonged] to the children 1121 of Ephraim; 669

17:9 And the coast 1366 descended 3381-1 unto the river 5158 Kanah, 7071 southward 5045 of the river: 5158 these cities 5892 of Ephraim 669 [are] among 8432 the cities 5892 of Manasseh: 4519 the coast 1366 of Manasseh 4519 also [was] on the north 6828 side of the river, 5158 and the outgoings 8444 of it were at the sea: 3220

17:10 Southward 5045 [it was] Ephraim's, 669 and northward 6828 [it was] Manasseh's, 4519 and the sea 3220 is his border; 1366 and they met together 6293-4 in Asher 836 on the north, 6828 and in Issachar 3485 on the east. 4217

17:11 And Manasseh 4519 had in Issachar 3485 and in Asher 836 Bethshean 1052 and her towns, 1323 and Ibleam 2991 and her towns, 1323 and the inhabitants 3427-6 of Dor 1756 and her towns, 1323 and the inhabitants 3427-6 of Endor 5874 and her towns, 1323 and the inhabitants 3427-6 of Taanach 8590 and her towns, 1323 and the inhabitants 3427-6 of Megiddo 4023 and her towns, 1323 [even] three 7969 countries. 5316

17:12 Yet the children 1121 of Manasseh 4519 could 3201-1 not drive out 3423-53 [the inhabitants of] those cities; 5892 but the Canaanites 3669 would 2974-55 dwell 3427-2 in that land. 776

17:13 Yet it came to pass, when the children 1121 of Israel 3478 were waxen strong, 2388-1 that they put 5414-4 the Canaanites 3669 to tribute; 4522 but did not utterly 3423-53 drive them out. 3423-52

17:14 And the children 1121 of Joseph 3130 spake 1696-17 unto Joshua, 3091 saying, 559-2 Why hast thou given 5414-1 me [but] one 259 lot 1486 and one 259 portion 2256 to inherit, 5159 seeing I [am] a great 7227 people, 5971 forasmuch as 5704 the LORD 3068 hath blessed 1288-14 me hitherto? 3541

17:15 And Joshua 3091 answered 559-4 them, If thou [be] a great 7227 people, 5971 [then] get thee up 5927-3 to the wood 3293 [country], and cut down 1254-14 for thyself there in the land 776 of the Perizzites 6522 and of the giants, 7497 if mount 2022 Ephraim 669 be too narrow 213-1 for thee.

17:16 And the children 1121 of Joseph 3130 said, 559-4 The hill 2022 is not enough 4672-11 for us: and all the Canaanites 3669 that dwell 3427-6 in the land 776 of the valley 6010 have chariots 7393 of iron, 1270 [both they] who [are] of Bethshean 1052 and her towns, 1323 and [they] who [are] of the valley 6010 of Jezreel. 3157

17:17 And Joshua 3091 spake 559-4 unto the house 1004 of Joseph, 3130 [even] to Ephraim 669 and to Manasseh, 4519 saying, 559-2 Thou [art] a great 7227 people, 5971 and hast great 1419 power: 3581 thou shalt not have one 259 lot 1486 [only]:

17:18 But the mountain 2022 shall be thine; for it [is] a wood, 3293 and thou shalt cut it down: 1254-14 and the outgoings 8444 of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out 3423-55 the Canaanites, 3669 though they have iron 1270 chariots, 7393 [and] though they [be] strong. 2389

18:1 And the whole congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 assembled together 6950-11 at Shiloh, 7887 and set up 7931-55 the tabernacle 168 of the congregation 4150 there. And the land 776 was subdued 3533-8 before 6440 them.

18:2 And there remained 3498-11 among the children 1121 of Israel 3478 seven 7651 tribes, 7626 which had not yet received 2505-1 their inheritance. 5159

18:3 And Joshua 3091 said 559-4 unto the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 How long [are] ye slack 7503-102 to go 935-2 to possess 3423-2 the land, 776 which the LORD 3068 God 430 of your fathers 1 hath given 5414-1 you?

18:4 Give 3051-3 out from among you three 7969 men 582 for [each] tribe: 7626 and I will send 7971-4 them, and they shall rise, 6965-4 and go 1980-101 through the land, 776 and describe 3789-4 it according 6310 to the inheritance 5159 of them; and they shall come 935-4 [again] to me.

18:5 And they shall divide 2505-98 it into seven 7651 parts: 2506 Judah 3063 shall abide 5975-4 in their coast 1366 on the south, 5045 and the house 1004 of Joseph 3130 shall abide 5975-4 in their coasts 1366 on the north. 6828

18:6 Ye shall therefore describe 3789-4 the land 776 [into] seven 7651 parts, 2506 and bring 935-52 [the description] hither to me, that I may cast 3384-1 lots 1486 for you here before 6440 the LORD 3068 our God. 430

18:7 But the Levites 3881 have no part 2506 among 7130 you; for the priesthood 3550 of the LORD 3068 [is] their inheritance: 5159 and Gad, 1410 and Reuben, 7205 and half 2677 the tribe 7626 of Manasseh, 4519 have received 3947-1 their inheritance 5159 beyond 5676 Jordan 3383 on the east, 4217 which Moses 4872 the servant 5650 of the LORD 3068 gave 5414-1 them.

18:8 And the men 582 arose, 6965-4 and went away: 3212-4 and Joshua 3091 charged 6680-17 them that went 1980-6 to describe 3789-2 the land, 776 saying, 559-2 Go 3212-3 and walk 1980-100 through the land, 776 and describe 3789-3 it, and come again 7725-3 to me, that I may here cast 7993-55 lots 1486 for you before 6440 the LORD 3068 in Shiloh. 7887

18:9 And the men 582 went 3212-4 and passed through 5674-4 the land, 776 and described 3789-4 it by cities 5892 into seven 7651 parts 2506 in a book, 5612 and came 935-4 [again] to Joshua 3091 to the host 4264 at Shiloh. 7887

18:10 And Joshua 3091 cast 7993-55 lots 1486 for them in Shiloh 7887 before 6440 the LORD: 3068 and there Joshua 3091 divided 2505-17 the land 776 unto the children 1121 of Israel 3478 according to their divisions. 4256

18:11 And the lot 1486 of the tribe 4294 of the children 1121 of Benjamin 1144 came up 5927-4 according to their families: 4940 and the coast 1366 of their lot 1486 came forth 3318-4 between the children 1121 of Judah 3063 and the children 1121 of Joseph. 3130

18:18 And passed along 5674-1 toward the side 3802 over against 4136 Arabah 6160 northward, 6828 and went down 3381-1 unto Arabah: 6160

18:19 And the border 1366 passed along 5674-1 to the side 3802 of Bethhoglah 1031 northward: 6828 and the outgoings 8444 of the border 1366 were at the north 6828 bay 3956 of the salt 4417 sea 3220 at the south 5045 end 7097 of Jordan: 3383 this [was] the south 5045 coast. 1366

19:9 Out of the portion 2256 of the children 1121 of Judah 3063 [was] the inheritance 5159 of the children 1121 of Simeon: 8095 for the part 2506 of the children 1121 of Judah 3063 was too much 7227 for them: therefore the children 1121 of Simeon 8095 had their inheritance 5157-4 within 8432 the inheritance 5159 of them.

20:3 That the slayer 7523-6 that killeth 5221-56 [any] person 5315 unawares 7684 [and] unwittingly 1847 may flee 5127-2 thither: and they shall be your refuge 4733 from the avenger 1350-6 of blood. 1818

20:4 And when he that doth flee 5127-1 unto one 259 of those cities 5892 shall stand 5975-1 at the entering 6607 of the gate 8179 of the city, 5892 and shall declare 1696-14 his cause 1697 in the ears 241 of the elders 2205 of that city, 5892 they shall take 622-1 him into the city 5892 unto them, and give 5414-1 him a place, 4725 that he may dwell 3427-1 among them.

20:5 And if the avenger 1350-6 of blood 1818 pursue 7291-4 after 310 him, then they shall not deliver 5462-55 the slayer 7523-6 up into his hand; 3027 because he smote 5221-52 his neighbour 7453 unwittingly, 1097 1847 and hated 8130-6 him not beforetime. 8543 8032

20:6 And he shall dwell 3427-1 in that city, 5892 until he stand 5975-2 before 6440 the congregation 5712 for judgment, 4941 [and] until the death 4194 of the high 1419 priest 3548 that shall be in those days: 3117 then shall the slayer 7523-6 return, 7725-4 and come 935-1 unto his own city, 5892 and unto his own house, 1004 unto the city 5892 from whence 834 he fled. 5127-1

20:7 And they appointed 6942-55 Kedesh 6943 in Galilee 1551 in mount 2022 Naphtali, 5321 and Shechem 7927 in mount 2022 Ephraim, 669 and Kirjatharba, 7153 which [is] Hebron, 2275 in the mountain 2022 of Judah. 3063

20:8 And on the other side 5676 Jordan 3383 by Jericho 3405 eastward, 4217 they assigned 5414-1 Bezer 1221 in the wilderness 4057 upon the plain 4334 out of the tribe 4294 of Reuben, 7205 and Ramoth 7216 in Gilead 1568 out of the tribe 4294 of Gad, 1410 and Golan 1474 in Bashan 1316 out of the tribe 4294 of Manasseh. 4519

20:9 These were the cities 5892 appointed 4152 for all the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and for the stranger 1616 that sojourneth 1481-6 among 8432 them, that whosoever killeth 5221-56 [any] person 5315 at unawares 7684 might flee 5127-2 thither, and not die 4191-4 by the hand 3027 of the avenger 1350-6 of blood, 1818 until he stood 5975-2 before 6440 the congregation. 5712

21:1 Then came near 5066-4 the heads 7218 of the fathers 1 of the Levites 3881 unto Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 and unto Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun, 5126 and unto the heads 7218 of the fathers 1 of the tribes 4294 of the children 1121 of Israel; 3478

21:2 And they spake 1696-17 unto them at Shiloh 7887 in the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 saying, 559-2 The LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 by the hand 3027 of Moses 4872 to give 5414-2 us cities 5892 to dwell in, 3427-2 with the suburbs 4054 thereof for our cattle. 929

21:3 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 gave 5414-4 unto the Levites 3881 out of their inheritance, 5159 at the commandment 6310 of the LORD, 3068 these cities 5892 and their suburbs. 4054

21:4 And the lot 1486 came out 3318-4 for the families 4940 of the Kohathites: 6956 and the children 1121 of Aaron 175 the priest, 3548 [which were] of the Levites, 3881 had by lot 1486 out of the tribe 4294 of Judah, 3063 and out of the tribe 4294 of Simeon, 8099 and out of the tribe 4294 of Benjamin, 1144 thirteen 7969 6240 cities. 5892

21:33 All the cities 5892 of the Gershonites 1649 according to their families 4940 [were] thirteen 7969 6240 cities 5892 with their suburbs. 4054

21:34 And unto the families 4940 of the children 1121 of Merari, 4847 the rest 3498-12 of the Levites, 3881 out of the tribe 4294 of Zebulun, 2074 Jokneam 3362 with her suburbs, 4054 and Kartah 7177 with her suburbs, 4054

21:35 Dimnah 1829 with her suburbs, 4054 Nahalal 5096 with her suburbs; 4054 four 702 cities. 5892

21:38 And out of the tribe 4294 of Gad, 1410 Ramoth 7433 in Gilead 1568 with her suburbs, 4054 [to be] a city 5892 of refuge 4733 for the slayer; 7523-6 and Mahanaim 4266 with her suburbs, 4054

21:39 Heshbon 2809 with her suburbs, 4054 Jazer 3270 with her suburbs; 4054 four 702 cities 5892 in all.

21:40 So all the cities 5892 for the children 1121 of Merari 4847 by their families, 4940 which were remaining 3498-12 of the families 4940 of the Levites, 3881 were [by] their lot 1486 twelve 8147 6240 cities. 5892

21:41 All the cities 5892 of the Levites 3881 within 8432 the possession 272 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 [were] forty 705 and eight 8083 cities 5892 with their suburbs. 4054

21:42 These cities 5892 5892 were every one with their suburbs 4054 round about 5439 them: thus [were] all these cities. 5892

21:43 And the LORD 3068 gave 5414-4 unto Israel 3478 all the land 776 which he sware 7650-8 to give 5414-2 unto their fathers; 1 and they possessed 3423-4 it, and dwelt 3427-4 therein.

21:44 And the LORD 3068 gave them rest 5117-4 round about, 5439 according to all that he sware 7650-8 unto their fathers: 1 and there stood 5975-1 not a man 376 of all their enemies 341-6 before 6440 them; the LORD 3068 delivered 5414-1 all their enemies 341-6 into their hand. 3027

21:45 There failed 5307-1 not ought 1697 of any good 2896 thing 1697 which the LORD 3068 had spoken 1696-14 unto the house 1004 of Israel; 3478 all came to pass. 935-6

22:1 Then Joshua 3091 called 7121-4 the Reubenites, 7206 and the Gadites, 1425 and the half 2677 tribe 4294 of Manasseh, 4519

22:2 And said 559-4 unto them, Ye have kept 8104-1 all that Moses 4872 the servant 5650 of the LORD 3068 commanded 6680-14 you, and have obeyed 8085-4 my voice 6963 in all that I commanded 6680-14 you:

22:3 Ye have not left 5800-1 your brethren 251 these many 7227 days 3117 unto this day, 3117 but have kept 8104-1 the charge 4931 of the commandment 4687 of the LORD 3068 your God. 430

22:4 And now the LORD 3068 your God 430 hath given rest 5117-52 unto your brethren, 251 as he promised 1696-14 them: therefore now return 6437-3 ye, and get 3212-3 you unto your tents, 168 [and] unto the land 776 of your possession, 272 which Moses 4872 the servant 5650 of the LORD 3068 gave 5414-1 you on the other side 5676 Jordan. 3383

22:5 But take diligent 3966 heed 8104-3 to do 6213-2 the commandment 4687 and the law, 8451 which Moses 4872 the servant 5650 of the LORD 3068 charged 6680-14 you, to love 157-2 the LORD 3068 your God, 430 and to walk 3212-2 in all his ways, 1870 and to keep 8104-2 his commandments, 4687 and to cleave 1692-2 unto him, and to serve 5647-2 him with all your heart 3824 and with all your soul. 5315

22:6 So Joshua 3091 blessed 1288-17 them, and sent them away: 7971-17 and they went 3212-4 unto their tents. 168

22:7 Now to the [one] half 2677 of the tribe 7626 of Manasseh 4519 Moses 4872 had given 5414-1 [possession] in Bashan: 1316 but unto the [other] half 2677 thereof gave 5414-1 Joshua 3091 among 5973 their brethren 251 on this side 5676 Jordan 3383 westward. 3220 And when Joshua 3091 sent them away 7971-14 also unto their tents, 168 then he blessed 1288-17 them,

22:8 And he spake 559-4 unto them, saying, 559-2 Return 7725-3 with much 7227 riches 5233 unto your tents, 168 and with very 3966 much 7227 cattle, 4735 with silver, 3701 and with gold, 2091 and with brass, 5178 and with iron, 1270 and with very 3966 much 7235-53 raiment: 8008 divide 2505-3 the spoil 7998 of your enemies 341-6 with your brethren. 251

22:9 And the children 1121 of Reuben 7205 and the children 1121 of Gad 1410 and the half 2677 tribe 7626 of Manasseh 4519 returned, 7725-4 and departed 3212-4 from the children 1121 of Israel 3478 out of Shiloh, 7887 which [is] in the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 to go 3212-2 unto the country 776 of Gilead, 1568 to the land 776 of their possession, 272 whereof they were possessed, 270-8 according to the word 6310 of the LORD 3068 by the hand 3027 of Moses. 4872

22:10 And when they came 935-4 unto the borders 1552 of Jordan, 3383 that [are] in the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 the children 1121 of Reuben 7205 and the children 1121 of Gad 1410 and the half 2677 tribe 7626 of Manasseh 4519 built 1129-4 there an altar 4196 by Jordan, 3383 a great 1419 altar 4196 to see to. 4758

22:11 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 heard 8085-4 say, 559-2 Behold, the children 1121 of Reuben 7205 and the children 1121 of Gad 1410 and the half 2677 tribe 7626 of Manasseh 4519 have built 1129-1 an altar 4196 over against 4136 the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 in the borders 1552 of Jordan, 3383 at the passage 5676 of the children 1121 of Israel. 3478

22:12 And when the children 1121 of Israel 3478 heard 8085-4 [of it], the whole congregation 5712 of the children 1121 of Israel 3478 gathered themselves together 6950-11 at Shiloh, 7887 to go up 5927-2 to war 6635 against them.

22:13 And the children 1121 of Israel 3478 sent 7971-4 unto the children 1121 of Reuben, 7205 and to the children 1121 of Gad, 1410 and to the half 2677 tribe 7626 of Manasseh, 4519 into the land 776 of Gilead, 1568 Phinehas 6372 the son 1121 of Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548

22:14 And with him ten 6235 princes, 5387 of each chief 1 house 1004 a prince 259 5387 259 5387 throughout all the tribes 4294 of Israel; 3478 and each one 376 [was] an head 7218 of the house 1004 of their fathers 1 among the thousands 505 of Israel. 3478

22:15 And they came 935-4 unto the children 1121 of Reuben, 7205 and to the children 1121 of Gad, 1410 and to the half 2677 tribe 7626 of Manasseh, 4519 unto the land 776 of Gilead, 1568 and they spake 1696-17 with them, saying, 559-2

22:16 Thus saith 559-1 the whole congregation 5712 of the LORD, 3068 What trespass 4604 [is] this that ye have committed 4603-1 against the God 430 of Israel, 3478 to turn away 7725-2 this day 3117 from following 310 the LORD, 3068 in that ye have builded 1129-2 you an altar, 4196 that ye might rebel 4775-2 this day 3117 against the LORD? 3068

22:17 [Is] the iniquity 5771 of Peor 6465 too little 4592 for us, from which we are not cleansed 2891-98 until this day, 3117 although there was a plague 5063 in the congregation 5712 of the LORD, 3068

22:18 But that ye must turn away 7725-4 this day 3117 from following 310 the LORD? 3068 and it will be, [seeing] ye rebel 4775-4 to day 3117 against the LORD, 3068 that to morrow 4279 he will be wroth 7107-4 with the whole congregation 5712 of Israel. 3478

22:19 Notwithstanding, 389 if the land 776 of your possession 272 [be] unclean, 2931 [then] pass ye over 5674-3 unto the land 776 of the possession 272 of the LORD, 3068 wherein the LORD'S 3068 tabernacle 4908 dwelleth, 7931-1 and take possession 270-10 among 8432 us: but rebel 4775-4 not against the LORD, 3068 nor 408 rebel 4775-4 against us, in building 1129-2 you an altar 4196 beside 1107 the altar 4196 of the LORD 3068 our God. 430

22:20 Did not Achan 5912 the son 1121 of Zerah 2226 commit 4603-1 a trespass 4604 in the accursed thing, 2764 and wrath 7110 fell 1961-1 on all the congregation 5712 of Israel? 3478 and that man 376 perished 1478-1 not alone 259 in his iniquity. 5771

22:21 Then the children 1121 of Reuben 7205 and the children 1121 of Gad 1410 and the half 2677 tribe 7626 of Manasseh 4519 answered, 6030-4 and said 1696-17 unto the heads 7218 of the thousands 505 of Israel, 3478

22:22 The LORD 3068 God 410 of gods, 430 the LORD 3068 God 410 of gods, 430 he knoweth, 3045-6 and Israel 3478 he shall know; 3045-4 if [it be] in rebellion, 4777 or if in transgression 4604 against the LORD, 3068 (save 3467-55 us not this day,) 3117

22:23 That we have built 1129-2 us an altar 4196 to turn 7725-2 from following 310 the LORD, 3068 or if to offer 5927-53 thereon burnt offering 5930 or meat offering, 4503 or if to offer 6213-2 peace 8002 offerings 2077 thereon, let the LORD 3068 himself require 1245-17 [it];

22:24 And if we have not [rather] done 6213-1 it for fear 1674 of [this] thing, 1697 saying, 559-2 In time to come 4279 your children 1121 might speak 559-4 unto our children, 1121 saying, 559-2 What have ye to do with the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel? 3478

22:25 For the LORD 3068 hath made 5414-1 Jordan 3383 a border 1366 between us and you, ye children 1121 of Reuben 7205 and children 1121 of Gad; 1410 ye have no part 2506 in the LORD: 3068 so shall your children 1121 make our children 1121 cease 7673-52 from 1115 fearing 3372-2 the LORD. 3068

22:26 Therefore we said, 559-4 Let us now prepare 6213-4 to build 1129-2 us an altar, 4196 not for burnt offering, 5930 nor for sacrifice: 2077

22:27 But [that] it [may be] a witness 5707 between us, and you, and our generations 1755 after 310 us, that we might do 5647-2 the service 5656 of the LORD 3068 before 6440 him with our burnt offerings, 5930 and with our sacrifices, 2077 and with our peace offerings; 8002 that your children 1121 may not say 559-4 to our children 1121 in time to come, 4279 Ye have no part 2506 in the LORD. 3068

22:28 Therefore said 559-4 we, that it shall be, when they should [so] say 559-4 to us or to our generations 1755 in time to come, 4279 that we may say 559-1 [again], Behold 7200-3 the pattern 8403 of the altar 4196 of the LORD, 3068 which our fathers 1 made, 6213-1 not for burnt offerings, 5930 nor for sacrifices; 2077 but it [is] a witness 5707 between us and you.

22:29 God forbid 2486 that we should rebel 4775-2 against the LORD, 3068 and turn 7725-2 this day 3117 from following 310 the LORD, 3068 to build 1129-2 an altar 4196 for burnt offerings, 5930 for meat offerings, 4503 or for sacrifices, 2077 beside the altar 4196 of the LORD 3068 our God 430 that [is] before 6440 his tabernacle. 4908

22:30 And when Phinehas 6372 the priest, 3548 and the princes 5387 of the congregation 5712 and heads 7218 of the thousands 505 of Israel 3478 which [were] with him, heard 8085-4 the words 1697 that the children 1121 of Reuben 7205 and the children 1121 of Gad 1410 and the children 1121 of Manasseh 4519 spake, 1696-14 it pleased 3190-4 5869 them.

22:31 And Phinehas 6372 the son 1121 of Eleazar 499 the priest 3548 said 559-4 unto the children 1121 of Reuben, 7205 and to the children 1121 of Gad, 1410 and to the children 1121 of Manasseh, 4519 This day 3117 we perceive 3045-1 that the LORD 3068 [is] among 8432 us, because ye have not committed 4603-1 this trespass 4604 against the LORD: 3068 now 227 ye have delivered 5337-52 the children 1121 of Israel 3478 out of the hand 3027 of the LORD. 3068

22:32 And Phinehas 6372 the son 1121 of Eleazar 499 the priest, 3548 and the princes, 5387 returned 7725-4 from the children 1121 of Reuben, 7205 and from the children 1121 of Gad, 1410 out of the land 776 of Gilead, 1568 unto the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 to the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 and brought them word 1697 again. 7725-55

22:33 And the thing 1697 pleased 3190-4 5869 the children 1121 of Israel; 3478 and the children 1121 of Israel 3478 blessed 1288-17 God, 430 and did not intend 559-1 to go up 5927-2 against them in battle, 6635 to destroy 7843-15 the land 776 wherein the children 1121 of Reuben 7205 and 1121 Gad 1410 dwelt. 3427-6

22:34 And the children 1121 of Reuben 7205 and the children 1121 of Gad 1410 called 7121-4 the altar 4196 [Ed]: for it [shall be] a witness 5707 between us that the LORD 3068 [is] God. 430

23:1 And it came to pass a long 7227 time 3117 after 310 that the LORD 3068 had given rest 5117-52 unto Israel 3478 from all their enemies 341-6 round about, 5439 that Joshua 3091 waxed old 2204-1 [and] stricken 935-1 in age. 3117

23:2 And Joshua 3091 called 7121-4 for all Israel, 3478 [and] for their elders, 2205 and for their heads, 7218 and for their judges, 8199-6 and for their officers, 7860-6 and said 559-4 unto them, I am old 2204-1 [and] stricken 935-1 in age: 3117

23:3 And ye have seen 7200-1 all that the LORD 3068 your God 430 hath done 6213-1 unto all these nations 1471 because 6440 of you; for the LORD 3068 your God 430 [is] he that hath fought 3898-12 for you.

23:4 Behold, 7200-3 I have divided 5307-52 unto you by lot these nations 1471 that remain, 7604-12 to be an inheritance 5159 for your tribes, 7626 from Jordan, 3383 with all the nations 1471 that I have cut off, 3772-52 even unto the great 1419 sea 3220 westward. 3996 8121

23:5 And the LORD 3068 your God, 430 he shall expel 1920-4 them from before 6440 you, and drive 3423-52 them from out of your sight; 6440 and ye shall possess 3423-1 their land, 776 as the LORD 3068 your God 430 hath promised 1696-14 unto you.

23:6 Be ye therefore very 3966 courageous 2388-1 to keep 8104-2 and to do 6213-2 all that is written 3789-7 in the book 5612 of the law 8451 of Moses, 4872 that ye turn not aside 5493-2 therefrom [to] the right hand 3225 or [to] the left; 8040

23:7 That ye come 935-2 not among these nations, 1471 these that remain 7604-12 among you; neither make mention 2142-55 of the name 8034 of their gods, 430 nor cause to swear 7650-55 [by them], neither serve 5647-4 them, nor bow 7812-101 yourselves unto them:

23:8 But cleave 1692-4 unto the LORD 3068 your God, 430 as ye have done 6213-1 unto this day. 3117

23:9 For the LORD 3068 hath driven out 3423-55 from before 6440 you great 1419 nations 1471 and strong: 6099 but [as for] you, no man 376 hath been able to stand 5975-1 before 6440 you unto this day. 3117

23:10 One 259 man 376 of you shall chase 7291-4 a thousand: 505 for the LORD 3068 your God, 430 he [it is] that fighteth 3898-12 for you, as he hath promised 1696-14 you.

23:11 Take good 3966 heed 8104-8 therefore unto yourselves, 5315 that ye love 157-2 the LORD 3068 your God. 430

23:12 Else if ye do in any wise 7725-2 go back, 7725-4 and cleave 1692-1 unto the remnant 3499 of these nations, 1471 [even] these that remain 7604-12 among you, and shall make marriages 2859-98 with them, and go in 935-1 unto them, and they to you:

23:13 Know 3045-4 for a certainty 3045-2 that the LORD 3068 your God 430 will no more 3254-55 drive out 3423-53 [any of] these nations 1471 from before 6440 you; but they shall be snares 6341 and traps 4170 unto you, and scourges 7850 in your sides, 6654 and thorns 6796 in your eyes, 5869 until ye perish 6-2 from off this good 2896 land 127 which the LORD 3068 your God 430 hath given 5414-1 you.

23:14 And, behold, this day 3117 I [am] going 1980-6 the way 1870 of all the earth: 776 and ye know 3045-1 in all your hearts 3824 and in all your souls, 5315 that not one 259 thing 1697 hath failed 5307-1 of all the good 2896 things 1697 which the LORD 3068 your God 430 spake 1696-14 concerning you; all are come to pass 935-1 unto you, [and] not one 259 thing 1697 hath failed 5307-1 thereof.

23:15 Therefore it shall come to pass, [that] as all good 2896 things 1697 are come 935-1 upon you, which the LORD 3068 your God 430 promised 1696-14 you; so shall the LORD 3068 bring 935-55 upon you all evil 7451 things, 1697 until he have destroyed 8045-53 you from off this good 2896 land 127 which the LORD 3068 your God 430 hath given 5414-1 you.

23:16 When ye have transgressed 5674-2 the covenant 1285 of the LORD 3068 your God, 430 which he commanded 6680-14 you, and have gone 1980-1 and served 5647-1 other 312 gods, 430 and bowed 7812-98 yourselves to them; then shall the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 be kindled 2734-1 against you, and ye shall perish 6-1 quickly 4120 from off the good 2896 land 776 which he hath given 5414-1 unto you.

24:1 And Joshua 3091 gathered 622-4 all the tribes 7626 of Israel 3478 to Shechem, 7927 and called 7121-4 for the elders 2205 of Israel, 3478 and for their heads, 7218 and for their judges, 8199-6 and for their officers; 7860-6 and they presented 3320-101 themselves before 6440 God. 430

24:2 And Joshua 3091 said 559-4 unto all the people, 5971 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 Your fathers 1 dwelt 3427-1 on the other side 5676 of the flood 5104 in old time, 5769 [even] Terah, 8646 the father 1 of Abraham, 85 and the father 1 of Nachor: 5152 and they served 5647-4 other 312 gods. 430

24:3 And I took 3947-4 your father 1 Abraham 85 from the other side 5676 of the flood, 5104 and led 3212-55 him throughout all the land 776 of Canaan, 3667 and multiplied 7235-55 his seed, 2233 and gave 5414-4 him Isaac. 3327

24:4 And I gave 5414-4 unto Isaac 3327 Jacob 3290 and Esau: 6215 and I gave 5414-4 unto Esau 6215 mount 2022 Seir, 8165 to possess 3423-2 it; but Jacob 3290 and his children 1121 went down 3381-1 into Egypt. 4714

24:5 I sent 7971-4 Moses 4872 also and Aaron, 175 and I plagued 5062-4 Egypt, 4714 according to that which 834 I did 6213-1 among 7130 them: and afterward 310 I brought you out. 3318-52

24:6 And I brought your fathers 1 out 3318-55 of Egypt: 4714 and ye came 935-4 unto the sea; 3220 and the Egyptians 4714 pursued 7291-4 after 310 your fathers 1 with chariots 7393 and horsemen 6571 unto the Red 5488 sea. 3220

24:7 And when they cried 6817-4 unto the LORD, 3068 he put 7760-4 darkness 3990 between you and the Egyptians, 4713 and brought 935-55 the sea 3220 upon them, and covered 3680-17 them; and your eyes 5869 have seen 7200-4 what I have done 6213-1 in Egypt: 4714 and ye dwelt 3427-4 in the wilderness 4057 a long 7227 season. 3117

24:8 And I brought 935-55 you into the land 776 of the Amorites, 567 which dwelt 3427-6 on the other side 5676 Jordan; 3383 and they fought 3898-11 with you: and I gave 5414-4 them into your hand, 3027 that ye might possess 3423-4 their land; 776 and I destroyed 8045-55 them from before 6440 you.

24:9 Then Balak 1111 the son 1121 of Zippor, 6834 king 4428 of Moab, 4124 arose 6965-4 and warred 3898-11 against Israel, 3478 and sent 7971-4 and called 7121-4 Balaam 1109 the son 1121 of Beor 1160 to curse 7043-15 you:

24:10 But I would 14-1 not hearken 8085-2 unto Balaam; 1109 therefore he blessed 1288-17 you still: 1288-2 so I delivered 5337-55 you out of his hand. 3027

24:11 And ye went over 5674-4 Jordan, 3383 and came 935-4 unto Jericho: 3405 and the men 1167 of Jericho 3405 fought 3898-11 against you, the Amorites, 567 and the Perizzites, 6522 and the Canaanites, 3669 and the Hittites, 2850 and the Girgashites, 1622 the Hivites, 2340 and the Jebusites; 2983 and I delivered 5414-4 them into your hand. 3027

24:12 And I sent 7971-4 the hornet 6880 before 6440 you, which drave them out 1644-17 from before 6440 you, [even] the two 8147 kings 4428 of the Amorites; 567 [but] not with thy sword, 2719 nor with thy bow. 7198

24:13 And I have given 5414-4 you a land 776 for which ye did not labour, 3021-1 and cities 5892 which ye built 1129-1 not, and ye dwell 3427-4 in them; of the vineyards 3754 and oliveyards 2132 which ye planted 5193-1 not do ye eat. 398-6

24:14 Now therefore fear 3372-3 the LORD, 3068 and serve 5647-3 him in sincerity 8549 and in truth: 571 and put away 5493-54 the gods 430 which your fathers 1 served 5647-1 on the other side 5676 of the flood, 5104 and in Egypt; 4714 and serve 5647-3 ye the LORD. 3068

24:15 And if it seem evil 7489-1 unto you 5869 to serve 5647-2 the LORD, 3068 choose 977-3 you this day 3117 whom 4310 ye will serve; 5647-4 whether the gods 430 which your fathers 1 served 5647-1 that [were] on the other side 5676 of the flood, 5104 or the gods 430 of the Amorites, 567 in whose land 776 ye dwell: 3427-6 but as for me and my house, 1004 we will serve 5647-4 the LORD. 3068

24:16 And the people 5971 answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 God forbid 2486 that we should forsake 5800-2 the LORD, 3068 to serve 5647-2 other 312 gods; 430

24:17 For the LORD 3068 our God, 430 he [it is] that brought us up 5927-56 and our fathers 1 out of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 from the house 1004 of bondage, 5650 and which did 6213-1 those great 1419 signs 226 in our sight, 5869 and preserved 8104-4 us in all the way 1870 wherein we went, 1980-1 and among all the people 5971 through 7130 whom we passed: 5674-1

24:18 And the LORD 3068 drave out 1644-17 from before 6440 us all the people, 5971 even the Amorites 567 which dwelt 3427-6 in the land: 776 [therefore] will we also serve 5647-4 the LORD; 3068 for he [is] our God. 430

24:19 And Joshua 3091 said 559-4 unto the people, 5971 Ye cannot 3808 3201-4 serve 5647-2 the LORD: 3068 for he [is] an holy 6918 God; 430 he [is] a jealous 7072 God; 410 he will not forgive 5375-4 your transgressions 6588 nor your sins. 2403

24:20 If ye forsake 5800-4 the LORD, 3068 and serve 5647-1 strange 5236 gods, 430 then he will turn 7725-1 and do you hurt, 7489-52 and consume 3615-14 you, after 310 that he hath done you good. 3190-52

24:21 And the people 5971 said 559-4 unto Joshua, 3091 Nay; but we will serve 5647-4 the LORD. 3068

24:22 And Joshua 3091 said 559-4 unto the people, 5971 Ye [are] witnesses 5707 against yourselves that ye have chosen 977-1 you the LORD, 3068 to serve 5647-2 him. And they said, 559-4 [We are] witnesses. 5707

24:23 Now therefore put away, 5493-54 [said he], the strange 5236 gods 430 which [are] among 7130 you, and incline 5186-54 your heart 3824 unto the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel. 3478

24:24 And the people 5971 said 559-4 unto Joshua, 3091 The LORD 3068 our God 430 will we serve, 5647-4 and his voice 6963 will we obey. 8085-4

24:25 So Joshua 3091 made 3772-4 a covenant 1285 with the people 5971 that day, 3117 and set 7760-4 them a statute 2706 and an ordinance 4941 in Shechem. 7927

24:26 And Joshua 3091 wrote 3789-4 these words 1697 in the book 5612 of the law 8451 of God, 430 and took 3947-4 a great 1419 stone, 68 and set it up 6965-55 there under an oak, 427 that [was] by the sanctuary 4720 of the LORD. 3068

24:27 And Joshua 3091 said 559-4 unto all the people, 5971 Behold, this stone 68 shall be a witness 5713 unto us; for it hath heard 8085-1 all the words 561 of the LORD 3068 which he spake 1696-14 unto us: it shall be therefore a witness 5713 unto you, lest ye deny 3584-17 your God. 430

24:28 So Joshua 3091 let the people 5971 depart, 7971-17 every man 376 unto his inheritance. 5159

24:29 And it came to pass after 310 these things, 1697 that Joshua 3091 the son 1121 of Nun, 5126 the servant 5650 of the LORD, 3068 died, 4191-4 [being] an hundred 3967 and ten 6235 years 8141 old. 1121

24:30 And they buried 6912-4 him in the border 1366 of his inheritance 5159 in Timnathserah, 8556 which [is] in mount 2022 Ephraim, 669 on the north 6828 side of the hill 2022 of Gaash. 1608

24:31 And Israel 3478 served 5647-4 the LORD 3068 all the days 3117 of Joshua, 3091 and all the days 3117 of the elders 2205 that overlived 748-52 3117 310 Joshua, 3091 and which had known 3045-1 all the works 4639 of the LORD, 3068 that he had done 6213-1 for Israel. 3478

24:32 And the bones 6106 of Joseph, 3130 which the children 1121 of Israel 3478 brought up 5927-52 out of Egypt, 4714 buried 6912-1 they in Shechem, 7927 in a parcel 2513 of ground 7704 which Jacob 3290 bought 7069-1 of the sons 1121 of Hamor 2544 the father 1 of Shechem 7927 for an hundred 3967 pieces of silver: 7192 and it became the inheritance 5159 of the children 1121 of Joseph. 3130

24:33 And Eleazar 499 the son 1121 of Aaron 175 died; 4191-1 and they buried 6912-4 him in a hill 1389 [that pertained to] Phinehas 6372 his son, 1121 which was given 5414-8 him in mount 2022 Ephraim. 669
