1:1 The vision 2377 of Isaiah 3470 the son 1121 of Amoz, 531 which he saw 2372-1 concerning Judah 3063 and Jerusalem 3389 in the days 3117 of Uzziah, 5818 Jotham, 3147 Ahaz, 271 [and] Hezekiah, 3169 kings 4428 of Judah. 3063

1:2 Hear, 8085-3 O heavens, 8064 and give ear, 238-54 O earth: 776 for the LORD 3068 hath spoken, 1696-14 I have nourished 1431-14 and brought up 7311-31 children, 1121 and they have rebelled 6586-1 against me.

1:3 The ox 7794 knoweth 3045-1 his owner, 7069-6 and the ass 2543 his master's 1167 crib: 18 [but] Israel 3478 doth not know, 3045-1 my people 5971 doth not consider. 995-110

1:4 Ah 1945 sinful 2398-6 nation, 1471 a people 5971 laden 3515 with iniquity, 5771 a seed 2233 of evildoers, 7489-56 children 1121 that are corrupters: 7843-56 they have forsaken 5800-1 853 the LORD, 3068 they have provoked 853 the Holy One 6918 of Israel 3478 unto anger, 5006-14 they are gone away 2114-8 backward. 268

1:5 Why should ye be stricken 5221-93 any more? ye will revolt 5627 more and more: 3254-55 the whole head 7218 is sick, 2483 and the whole heart 3824 faint. 1742

1:6 From the sole 3709 of the foot 7272 even unto the head 7218 [there is] no soundness 4974 in it; [but] wounds, 6482 and bruises, 2250 and putrifying 2961 sores: 4347 they have not been closed, 2115-1 neither bound up, 2280-27 neither mollified 7401-27 with ointment. 8081

1:7 Your country 776 [is] desolate, 8077 your cities 5892 [are] burned 8313-7 with fire: 784 your land, 127 strangers 2114-5 devour 398-6 it in your presence, and [it is] desolate, 8077 as overthrown 4114 by strangers. 2114-5

1:8 And the daughter 1323 of Zion 6726 is left 3498-8 as a cottage 5521 in a vineyard, 3754 as a lodge 4412 in a garden of cucumbers, 4750 as a besieged 5341-7 city. 5892

1:9 Except 3884 the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 had left 3498-52 unto us a very small 4592 remnant, 8300 we should have been 1961-1 as Sodom, 5467 [and] we should have been like 1819-1 unto Gomorrah. 6017

1:10 Hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 ye rulers 7101 of Sodom; 5467 give ear 238-54 unto the law 8451 of our God, 430 ye people 5971 of Gomorrah. 6017

1:11 To what purpose 4100 [is] the multitude 7230 of your sacrifices 2077 unto me? saith 559-4 the LORD: 3068 I am full 7646-1 of the burnt offerings 5930 of rams, 352 and the fat 2459 of fed beasts; 4806 and I delight 2654-1 not in the blood 1818 of bullocks, 6499 or of lambs, 3532 or of he goats. 6260

1:12 When ye come 935-4 to appear 7200-9 before 6440 me, who hath required 1245-14 this at your hand, 3027 to tread 7429-2 my courts? 2691

1:13 Bring 935-53 no more 3254-55 vain 7723 oblations; 4503 incense 7004 is an abomination 8441 unto me; the new moons 2320 and sabbaths, 7676 the calling 7121-2 of assemblies, 4744 I cannot away with; 3201-4 [it is] iniquity, 205 even the solemn meeting. 6116

1:14 Your new moons 2320 and your appointed feasts 4150 my soul 5315 hateth: 8130-1 they are a trouble 2960 unto me; I am weary 3811-8 to bear 5375-2 [them].

1:15 And when ye spread forth 6566-15 your hands, 3709 I will hide 5956-55 mine eyes 5869 from you: yea, when ye make many 7235-55 prayers, 8605 I will not hear: 8085-6 your hands 3027 are full 4390-1 of blood. 1818

1:16 Wash 7364-3 you, make you clean; 2135-100 put away 5493-54 the evil 7455 of your doings 4611 from before 5048 mine eyes; 5869 cease 2308-3 to do evil; 7489-53

1:17 Learn 3925-3 to do well; 3190-53 seek 1875-3 judgment, 4941 relieve 833-16 the oppressed, 2541 judge 8199-3 the fatherless, 3490 plead 7378-3 for the widow. 490

1:18 Come 3212-3 now, and let us reason together, 3198-11 saith 559-4 the LORD: 3068 though your sins 2399 be as scarlet, 8144 they shall be as white 3835-55 as snow; 7950 though they be red 119-55 like crimson, 8438 they shall be as wool. 6785

1:19 If ye be willing 14-4 and obedient, 8085-1 ye shall eat 398-4 the good 2898 of the land: 776

1:20 But if ye refuse 3985-17 and rebel, 4784-1 ye shall be devoured 398-29 with the sword: 2719 for the mouth 6310 of the LORD 3068 hath spoken 1696-14 [it].

1:21 How is the faithful 539-12 city 7151 become an harlot! 2181-6 it was full 4392 of judgment; 4941 righteousness 6664 lodged 3885-4 in it; but now murderers. 7523-18

1:22 Thy silver 3701 is become dross, 5509 thy wine 5435 mixed 4107-7 with water: 4325

1:23 Thy princes 8269 [are] rebellious, 5637-6 and companions 2270 of thieves: 1590 every one loveth 157-6 gifts, 7810 and followeth 7291-6 after rewards: 8021 they judge 8199-4 not the fatherless, 3490 neither doth the cause 7379 of the widow 490 come 935-4 unto them.

1:24 Therefore saith 5002-7 the Lord, 113 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the mighty 46 One of Israel, 3478 Ah, 1945 I will ease 5162-11 me of mine adversaries, 6862 and avenge 5358-11 me of mine enemies: 341-6

1:25 And I will turn 7725-55 my hand 3027 upon thee, and purely 1253 purge away 6884-4 thy dross, 5509 and take away 5493-55 all thy tin: 913

1:26 And I will restore 7725-55 thy judges 8199-6 as at the first, 7223 and thy counsellors 3289-6 as at the beginning: 8462 afterward 310 thou shalt be called, 7121-11 The city 5892 of righteousness, 6664 the faithful 539-12 city. 7151

1:27 Zion 6726 shall be redeemed 6299-11 with judgment, 4941 and her converts 7725-6 with righteousness. 6666

1:28 And the destruction 7667 of the transgressors 6586-6 and of the sinners 2400 [shall be] together, 3162 and they that forsake 5800-6 the LORD 3068 shall be consumed. 3615-4

1:29 For they shall be ashamed 954-4 of the oaks 352 which ye have desired, 2530-1 and ye shall be confounded 2659-4 for the gardens 1593 that ye have chosen. 977-1

1:30 For ye shall be as an oak 424 whose leaf 5929 fadeth, 5034-6 and as a garden 1593 that hath no water. 4325

1:31 And the strong 2634 shall be as tow, 5296 and the maker 6467 of it as a spark, 5213 and they shall both 8147 burn 1197-1 together, 3162 and none shall quench 3518-18 [them].

2:1 The word 1697 that Isaiah 3470 the son 1121 of Amoz 531 saw 2372-1 concerning Judah 3063 and Jerusalem. 3389

2:2 And it shall come to pass in the last 319 days, 3117 [that] the mountain 2022 of the LORD'S 3068 house 1004 shall be established 3559-12 in the top 7218 of the mountains, 2022 and shall be exalted 5375-12 above the hills; 1389 and all nations 1471 shall flow 5102-1 unto it.

2:3 And many 7227 people 5971 shall go 1980-1 and say, 559-1 Come 3212-3 ye, and let us go up 5927-4 to the mountain 2022 of the LORD, 3068 to the house 1004 of the God 430 of Jacob; 3290 and he will teach 3384-55 us of his ways, 1870 and we will walk 3212-4 in his paths: 734 for out of Zion 6726 shall go forth 3318-4 the law, 8451 and the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 from Jerusalem. 3389

2:4 And he shall judge 8199-1 among the nations, 1471 and shall rebuke 3198-52 many 7227 people: 5971 and they shall beat 3807-14 their swords 2719 into plowshares, 855 and their spears 2595 into pruninghooks: 4211 nation 1471 shall not lift up 5375-4 sword 2719 against nation, 1471 neither shall they learn 3925-4 war 4421 any more.

2:5 O house 1004 of Jacob, 3290 come 3212-3 ye, and let us walk 3212-4 in the light 216 of the LORD. 3068

2:6 Therefore thou hast forsaken 5203-1 thy people 5971 the house 1004 of Jacob, 3290 because they be replenished 4390-1 from the east, 6924 and [are] soothsayers 6049-26 like the Philistines, 6430 and they please 5606-55 themselves in the children 3206 of strangers. 5237

2:7 Their land 776 also is full 4390-11 of silver 3701 and gold, 2091 neither [is there any] end 7097 of their treasures; 214 their land 776 is also full 4390-11 of horses, 5483 neither [is there any] end 7097 of their chariots: 4818

2:8 Their land 776 also is full 4390-11 of idols; 457 they worship 7812-101 the work 4639 of their own hands, 3027 that which their own fingers 676 have made: 6213-1

2:9 And the mean man 120 boweth down, 7817-11 and the great man 376 humbleth 8213-4 himself: therefore forgive 5375-4 them not.

2:10 Enter 935-3 into the rock, 6697 and hide 2934-10 thee in the dust, 6083 for 6440 fear 6343 of the LORD, 3068 and for the glory 1926 of his majesty. 1347

2:11 The lofty 1365 looks 5869 of man 120 shall be humbled, 8213-1 and the haughtiness 7312 of men 582 shall be bowed down, 7817-1 and the LORD 3068 alone shall be exalted 7682-8 in that day. 3117

2:12 For the day 3117 of the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 [shall be] upon every [one that is] proud 1343 and lofty, 7311-6 and upon every [one that is] lifted up; 5375-12 and he shall be brought low: 8213-1

2:13 And upon all the cedars 730 of Lebanon, 3844 [that are] high 7311-6 and lifted up, 5375-12 and upon all the oaks 437 of Bashan, 1316

2:14 And upon all the high 7311-6 mountains, 2022 and upon all the hills 1389 [that are] lifted up, 5375-12

2:15 And upon every high 1364 tower, 4026 and upon every fenced 1219-7 wall, 2346

2:16 And upon all the ships 591 of Tarshish, 8659 and upon all pleasant 2532 pictures. 7914

2:17 And the loftiness 1365 of man 120 shall be bowed down, 7817-1 and the haughtiness 7312 of men 582 shall be made low: 8213-1 and the LORD 3068 alone shall be exalted 7682-8 in that day. 3117

2:18 And the idols 457 he shall utterly 3632 abolish. 2498-4

2:19 And they shall go 935-1 into the holes 4631 of the rocks, 6697 and into the caves 4247 of the earth, 6083 for 6440 fear 6343 of the LORD, 3068 and for the glory 1926 of his majesty, 1347 when he ariseth 6965-2 to shake terribly 6206-2 the earth. 776

2:20 In that day 3117 a man 120 shall cast 7993-55 his idols 457 of silver, 3701 and his idols 457 of gold, 2091 which they made 6213-1 [each one] for himself to worship, 7812-99 to the moles 2661 6512 and to the bats; 5847

2:21 To go 935-2 into the clefts 5366 of the rocks, 6697 and into the tops 5585 of the ragged rocks, 5553 for 6440 fear 6343 of the LORD, 3068 and for the glory 1926 of his majesty, 1347 when he ariseth 6965-2 to shake terribly 6206-2 the earth. 776

2:22 Cease 2308-3 ye from man, 120 whose breath 5397 [is] in his nostrils: 639 for wherein is he to be accounted of? 2803-12

3:1 For, behold, the Lord, 113 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 doth take away 5493-56 from Jerusalem 3389 and from Judah 3063 the stay 4937 and the staff, 4938 the whole 3605 stay 4937 of bread, 3899 and the whole 3605 stay 4937 of water, 4325

3:2 The mighty man, 1368 and the man 376 of war, 4421 the judge, 8199-6 and the prophet, 5030 and the prudent, 7080-6 and the ancient, 2205

3:3 The captain 8269 of fifty, 2572 and the honourable 5375-7 6440 man, and the counsellor, 3289-6 and the cunning 2450 artificer, 2791 and the eloquent 995-12 orator. 3908

3:4 And I will give 5414-1 children 5288 [to be] their princes, 8269 and babes 8586 shall rule 4910-4 over them.

3:5 And the people 5971 shall be oppressed, 5065-8 every one 376 by another, 376 and every one 376 by his neighbour: 7453 the child 5288 shall behave himself proudly 7292-4 against the ancient, 2205 and the base 7034-12 against the honourable. 3513-12

3:6 When a man 376 shall take hold 8610-4 of his brother 251 of the house 1004 of his father, 1 [saying], Thou hast clothing, 8071 be thou our ruler, 7101 and [let] this ruin 4384 [be] under thy hand: 3027

3:7 In that day 3117 shall he swear, 5375-4 saying, 559-2 I will not be an healer; 2280-6 for in my house 1004 [is] neither bread 3899 nor clothing: 8071 make 7760-4 me not a ruler 7101 of the people. 5971

3:8 For Jerusalem 3389 is ruined, 3782-1 and Judah 3063 is fallen: 5307-1 because their tongue 3956 and their doings 4611 [are] against the LORD, 3068 to provoke 4784-53 the eyes 5869 of his glory. 3519

3:9 The shew 1971 of their countenance 6440 doth witness 6030-1 against them; and they declare 5046-52 their sin 2403 as Sodom, 5467 they hide 3582-14 [it] not. Woe 188 unto their soul! 5315 for they have rewarded 1580-1 evil 7451 unto themselves.

3:10 Say 559-3 ye to the righteous, 6662 that [it shall be] well 2896 [with him]: for they shall eat 398-4 the fruit 6529 of their doings. 4611

3:11 Woe 188 unto the wicked! 7563 [it shall be] ill 7451 [with him]: for the reward 1576 of his hands 3027 shall be given 6213-11 him.

3:12 [As for] my people, 5971 children 5953-26 [are] their oppressors, 5065-6 and women 802 rule 4910-1 over them. O my people, 5971 they which lead 833-18 thee cause [thee] to err, 8582-56 and destroy 1104-14 the way 1870 of thy paths. 734

3:13 The LORD 3068 standeth up 5324-12 to plead, 7378-2 and standeth 5975-6 to judge 1777-2 the people. 5971

3:14 The LORD 3068 will enter 935-4 into judgment 4941 with the ancients 2205 of his people, 5971 and the princes 8269 thereof: for ye have eaten up 1197-14 the vineyard; 3754 the spoil 1500 of the poor 6041 [is] in your houses. 1004

3:15 What mean ye [that] ye beat 1792-17 my people 5971 to pieces, and grind 2912-4 the faces 6440 of the poor? 6041 saith 5002-7 the Lord 136 GOD 3069 of hosts. 6635

3:16 Moreover the LORD 3068 saith, 559-4 Because 3282 the daughters 1323 of Zion 6726 are haughty, 1361-1 and walk 3212-4 with stretched forth 5186-7 necks 1627 and wanton 8265-18 eyes, 5869 walking 1980-2 and mincing 2952-2 [as] they go, 3212-4 and making a tinkling 5913-17 with their feet: 7272

3:17 Therefore the Lord 136 will smite with a scab 5596-14 the crown of the head 6936 of the daughters 1323 of Zion, 6726 and the LORD 3068 will discover 6168-17 their secret parts. 6596

3:18 In that day 3117 the Lord 136 will take away 5493-55 the bravery 8597 of [their] tinkling ornaments 5914 [about their feet], and [their] cauls, 7636 and [their] round tires like the moon, 7720

3:19 The chains, 5188 and the bracelets, 8285 and the mufflers, 7479

3:20 The bonnets, 6287 and the ornaments of the legs, 6807 and the headbands, 7196 and the tablets, 5315 1004 and the earrings, 3908

3:21 The rings, 2885 and nose 639 jewels, 5141

3:22 The changeable suits of apparel, 4254 and the mantles, 4595 and the wimples, 4304 and the crisping pins, 2754

3:23 The glasses, 1549 and the fine linen, 5466 and the hoods, 6797 and the vails. 7289

3:24 And it shall come to pass, [that] instead of sweet smell 1314 there shall be stink; 4716 and instead of a girdle 2290 a rent; 5364 and instead of well set 4639 hair 4748 baldness; 7144 and instead of a stomacher 6614 a girding 4228 of sackcloth; 8242 [and] burning 3587 instead of beauty. 3308

3:25 Thy men 4962 shall fall 5307-4 by the sword, 2719 and thy mighty 1369 in the war. 4421

3:26 And her gates 6607 shall lament 578-1 and mourn; 56-1 and she [being] desolate 5352-8 shall sit 3427-4 upon the ground. 776

4:1 And in that day 3117 seven 7651 women 802 shall take hold 2388-52 of one 259 man, 376 saying, 559-2 We will eat 398-4 our own bread, 3899 and wear 3847-4 our own apparel: 8071 only let us be called 7121-11 by thy name, 8034 to take away 622-3 our reproach. 2781

4:2 In that day 3117 shall the branch 6780 of the LORD 3068 be beautiful 6643 and glorious, 3519 and the fruit 6529 of the earth 776 [shall be] excellent 1347 and comely 8597 for them that are escaped 6413 of Israel. 3478

4:3 And it shall come to pass, [that he that is] left 7604-12 in Zion, 6726 and [he that] remaineth 3498-12 in Jerusalem, 3389 shall be called 559-11 holy, 6918 [even] every one that is written 3789-7 among the living 2416 in Jerusalem: 3389

4:4 When the Lord 136 shall have washed 7364-1 away the filth 6675 of the daughters 1323 of Zion, 6726 and shall have purged 1740-55 the blood 1818 of Jerusalem 3389 from the midst 7130 thereof by the spirit 7307 of judgment, 4941 and by the spirit 7307 of burning. 1197-15

4:5 And the LORD 3068 will create 1254-1 upon every dwelling place 4349 of mount 2022 Zion, 6726 and upon her assemblies, 4744 a cloud 6051 and smoke 6227 by day, 3119 and the shining 5051 of a flaming 3852 fire 784 by night: 3915 for upon all the glory 3519 [shall be] a defence. 2646

4:6 And there shall be a tabernacle 5521 for a shadow 6738 in the daytime 3119 from the heat, 2721 and for a place of refuge, 4268 and for a covert 4563 from storm 2230 and from rain. 4306

5:1 Now will I sing 7891-4 to my wellbeloved 3039 a song 7892 of my beloved 1730 touching his vineyard. 3754 My wellbeloved 3039 hath a vineyard 3754 in a very fruitful 1121 8081 hill: 7161

5:2 And he fenced 5823-17 it, and gathered out the stones 5619-17 thereof, and planted 5193-4 it with the choicest vine, 8321 and built 1129-4 a tower 4026 in the midst 8432 of it, and also made 2672-1 a winepress 3342 therein: and he looked 6960-17 that it should bring forth 6213-2 grapes, 6025 and it brought forth 6213-4 wild grapes. 891

5:3 And now, O inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem, 3389 and men 376 of Judah, 3063 judge, 8199-3 I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. 3754

5:4 What could have been done 6213-2 more to my vineyard, 3754 that I have not done 6213-1 in it? wherefore, 4069 when I looked 6960-14 that it should bring forth 6213-2 grapes, 6025 brought it forth 6213-4 wild grapes? 891

5:5 And now go to; I will tell 3045-55 you what I will do 6213-6 to my vineyard: 3754 I will take away 5493-53 the hedge 4881 thereof, and it shall be eaten up; 1197-15 [and] break down 6555-2 the wall 1447 thereof, and it shall be trodden down: 4823

5:6 And I will lay 7896-4 it waste: 1326 it shall not be pruned, 2168-11 nor digged; 5737-11 but there shall come up 5927-1 briers 8068 and thorns: 7898 I will also command 6680-17 the clouds 5645 that they rain 4305-53 no rain 4306 upon it.

5:7 For the vineyard 3754 of the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 [is] the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 and the men 376 of Judah 3063 his pleasant 8191 plant: 5194 and he looked 6960-17 for judgment, 4941 but behold oppression; 4939 for righteousness, 6666 but behold a cry. 6818

5:8 Woe 1945 unto them that join 5060-56 house 1004 to house, 1004 [that] lay 7126-55 field 7704 to field, 7704 till [there be] no 657 place, 4725 that they may be placed 3427-90 alone in the midst 7130 of the earth! 776

5:9 In mine ears 241 [said] the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 Of a truth 3808 many 7227 houses 1004 shall be desolate, 8047 [even] great 1419 and fair, 2896 without inhabitant. 3427-6

5:10 Yea, 3588 ten 6235 acres 6776 of vineyard 3754 shall yield 6213-4 one 259 bath, 1324 and the seed 2233 of an homer 2563 shall yield 6213-4 an ephah. 374

5:11 Woe 1945 unto them that rise up early 7925-56 in the morning, 1242 [that] they may follow 7291-4 strong drink; 7941 that continue 309-18 until night, 5399 [till] wine 3196 inflame 1814-55 them!

5:12 And the harp, 3658 and the viol, 5035 the tabret, 8596 and pipe, 2485 and wine, 3196 are in their feasts: 4960 but they regard 5027-55 not the work 6467 of the LORD, 3068 neither consider 7200-1 the operation 4639 of his hands. 3027

5:13 Therefore my people 5971 are gone into captivity, 1540-1 because [they have] no knowledge: 1847 and their honourable 3519 men 4962 [are] famished, 7458 and their multitude 1995 dried up 6704 with thirst. 6772

5:14 Therefore hell 7585 hath enlarged 7337-52 herself, 5315 and opened 6473-1 her mouth 6310 without measure: 2706 and their glory, 1926 and their multitude, 1995 and their pomp, 7588 and he that rejoiceth, 5938 shall descend 3381-1 into it.

5:15 And the mean man 120 shall be brought down, 7817-11 and the mighty man 376 shall be humbled, 8213-4 and the eyes 5869 of the lofty 1364 shall be humbled: 8213-4

5:16 But the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 shall be exalted 1361-4 in judgment, 4941 and God 410 that is holy 6918 shall be sanctified 6942-8 in righteousness. 6666

5:17 Then shall the lambs 3532 feed 7462-1 after their manner, 1699 and the waste places 2723 of the fat ones 4220 shall strangers 1481-6 eat. 398-4

5:18 Woe 1945 unto them that draw 4900-6 iniquity 5771 with cords 2256 of vanity, 7723 and sin 2403 as it were with a cart 5699 rope: 5688

5:19 That say, 559-6 Let him make speed, 4116-17 [and] hasten 2363-55 his work, 4639 that we may see 7200-4 [it]: and let the counsel 6098 of the Holy One 6918 of Israel 3478 draw nigh 7126-4 and come, 935-4 that we may know 3045-4 [it]!

5:20 Woe 1945 unto them that call 559-6 evil 7451 good, 2896 and good 2896 evil; 7451 that put 7760-6 darkness 2822 for light, 216 and light 216 for darkness; 2822 that put 7760-6 bitter 4751 for sweet, 4966 and sweet 4966 for bitter! 4751

5:21 Woe 1945 unto [them that are] wise 2450 in their own eyes, 5869 and prudent 995-12 in their own sight! 6440

5:22 Woe 1945 unto [them that are] mighty 1368 to drink 8354-2 wine, 3196 and men 582 of strength 2428 to mingle 4537-2 strong drink: 7941

5:23 Which justify 6663-56 the wicked 7563 for 6118 reward, 7810 and take away 5493-55 the righteousness 6666 of the righteous 6662 from him!

5:24 Therefore as the fire 3956 784 devoureth 398-2 the stubble, 7179 and the flame 3852 consumeth 7503-4 the chaff, 2842 [so] their root 8328 shall be as rottenness, 4716 and their blossom 6525 shall go up 5927-4 as dust: 80 because they have cast away 3988-1 the law 8451 of the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 and despised 5006-14 the word 565 of the Holy One 6918 of Israel. 3478

5:25 Therefore is the anger 639 of the LORD 3068 kindled 2734-1 against his people, 5971 and he hath stretched forth 5186-4 his hand 3027 against them, and hath smitten 5221-55 them: and the hills 2022 did tremble, 7264-4 and their carcases 5038 [were] torn 5478 in the midst 7130 of the streets. 2351 For all this his anger 639 is not turned away, 7725-1 but his hand 3027 [is] stretched out 5186-7 still.

5:26 And he will lift up 5375-1 an ensign 5251 to the nations 1471 from far, 7350 and will hiss 8319-1 unto them from the end 7097 of the earth: 776 and, behold, they shall come 935-4 with speed 4120 swiftly: 7031

5:27 None shall be weary 5889 nor stumble 3782-6 among them; none shall slumber 5123-4 nor sleep; 3462-4 neither shall the girdle 232 of their loins 2504 be loosed, 6605-8 nor the latchet 8288 of their shoes 5275 be broken: 5423-8

5:28 Whose arrows 2671 [are] sharp, 8150-6 and all their bows 7198 bent, 1869-7 their horses' 5483 hoofs 6541 shall be counted 2803-8 like flint, 6862 and their wheels 1534 like a whirlwind: 5492

5:29 Their roaring 7581 [shall be] like a lion, 3833 they shall roar 7580-4|7580-1-k like young lions: 3715 yea, they shall roar, 5098-4 and lay hold 270-4 of the prey, 2964 and shall carry [it] away safe, 6403-55 and none shall deliver 5337-56 [it].

5:30 And in that day 3117 they shall roar 5098-4 against them like the roaring 5100 of the sea: 3220 and if [one] look 5027-14 unto the land, 776 behold darkness 2822 [and] sorrow, 6862 and the light 216 is darkened 2821-1 in the heavens 6183 thereof.

6:1 In the year 8141 that king 4428 Uzziah 5818 died 4194 I saw 7200-4 also 853 the Lord 136 sitting 3427-6 upon a throne, 3678 high 7311-6 and lifted up, 5375-12 and his train 7757 filled 4392 853 the temple. 1964

6:2 Above 4605 it stood 5975-6 the seraphims: 8314 each one 259 had six 8337 3671 wings; 8337 3671 with twain 8147 he covered 3680-17 his face, 6440 and with twain 8147 he covered 3680-17 his feet, 7272 and with twain 8147 he did fly. 5774-34

6:3 And one cried 7121-1 unto another, and said, 559-1 Holy, 6918 holy, 6918 holy, 6918 [is] the LORD 3068 of hosts: 6635 the whole earth 776 [is] full 4393 of his glory. 3519

6:4 And the posts 520 of the door 5592 moved 5128-4 at the voice 6963 of him that cried, 7121-6 and the house 1004 was filled 4390-11 with smoke. 6227

6:5 Then said 559-4 I, Woe 188 [is] me! for I am undone; 1820-8 because I [am] a man 376 of unclean 2931 lips, 8193 and I dwell 3427-6 in the midst 8432 of a people 5971 of unclean 2931 lips: 8193 for mine eyes 5869 have seen 7200-1 the King, 4428 the LORD 3068 of hosts. 6635

6:6 Then flew 5774-4 one 259 of the seraphims 8314 unto me, having a live coal 7531 in his hand, 3027 [which] he had taken 3947-1 with the tongs 4457 from off the altar: 4196

6:7 And he laid 5060-55 [it] upon my mouth, 6310 and said, 559-4 Lo, this hath touched 5060-1 thy lips; 8193 and thine iniquity 5771 is taken away, 5493-1 and thy sin 2403 purged. 3722-29

6:8 Also I heard 8085-4 the voice 6963 of the Lord, 136 saying, 559-6 Whom shall I send, 7971-4 and who will go 3212-4 for us? Then said 559-4 I, Here [am] I; send 7971-3 me.

6:9 And he said, 559-4 Go, 3212-3 and tell 559-1 this people, 5971 Hear 8085-3 ye indeed, 8085-2 but understand 995-4 not; and see 7200-3 ye indeed, 7200-2 but perceive 3045-4 not.

6:10 Make the heart 3820 of this people 5971 fat, 8080-54 and make their ears 241 heavy, 3513-54 and shut 8173-54 their eyes; 5869 lest they see 7200-4 with their eyes, 5869 and hear 8085-4 with their ears, 241 and understand 995-4 with their heart, 3824 and convert, 7725-6 and be healed. 7495-1

6:11 Then said 559-4 I, Lord, 136 how long? And he answered, 559-4 Until the cities 5892 be wasted 7582-1 without inhabitant, 3427-6 and the houses 1004 without man, 120 and the land 127 be utterly 8077 desolate, 7582-11

6:12 And the LORD 3068 have removed men 120 far away, 7368-14 and [there be] a great 7227 forsaking 5805 in the midst 7130 of the land. 776

6:13 But yet in it [shall be] a tenth, 6224 and [it] shall return, 7725-1 and shall be eaten: 1197-15 as a teil tree, 424 and as an oak, 437 whose substance 4678 [is] in them, when they cast 7995 [their leaves: so] the holy 6944 seed 2233 [shall be] the substance 4678 thereof.

7:1 And it came to pass in the days 3117 of Ahaz 271 the son 1121 of Jotham, 3147 the son 1121 of Uzziah, 5818 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 [that] Rezin 7526 the king 4428 of Syria, 758 and Pekah 6492 the son 1121 of Remaliah, 7425 king 4428 of Israel, 3478 went up 5927-1 toward Jerusalem 3389 to war 4421 against it, but could 3201-1 not prevail 3898-9 against it.

7:2 And it was told 5046-93 the house 1004 of David, 1732 saying, 559-2 Syria 758 is confederate 5117-1 with Ephraim. 669 And his heart 3824 was moved, 5128-4 and the heart 3824 of his people, 5971 as the trees 6086 of the wood 3293 are moved 5128-2 with 6440 the wind. 7307

7:3 Then said 559-4 the LORD 3068 unto Isaiah, 3470 Go forth 3318-3 now to meet 7125-2 Ahaz, 271 thou, and Shearjashub 7610 thy son, 1121 at the end 7097 of the conduit 8585 of the upper 5945 pool 1295 in the highway 4546 of the fuller's 3526-5 field; 7704

7:4 And say 559-1 unto him, Take heed, 8104-10 and be quiet; 8252-54 fear 3372-4 not, neither be fainthearted 7401-11 3824 for the two 8147 tails 2180 of these smoking 6226 firebrands, 181 for the fierce 2750 anger 639 of Rezin 7526 with Syria, 758 and of the son 1121 of Remaliah. 7425

7:5 Because Syria, 758 Ephraim, 669 and the son 1121 of Remaliah, 7425 have taken evil 7451 counsel 3289-1 against thee, saying, 559-2

7:6 Let us go up 5927-4 against Judah, 3063 and vex 6973-55 it, and let us make a breach 1234-55 therein for us, and set 4427-55 a king 4428 in the midst 8432 of it, [even] the son 1121 of Tabeal: 2870

7:7 Thus 3541 saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 It shall not stand, 6965-4 neither shall it come to pass.

7:8 For the head 7218 of Syria 758 [is] Damascus, 1834 and the head 7218 of Damascus 1834 [is] Rezin; 7526 and within threescore 8346 and five 2568 years 8141 shall Ephraim 669 be broken, 2865-11 that it be not a people. 5971

7:9 And the head 7218 of Ephraim 669 [is] Samaria, 8111 and the head 7218 of Samaria 8111 [is] Remaliah's 7425 son. 1121 If ye will not believe, 539-55 surely ye shall not be established. 539-11

7:10 Moreover the LORD 3068 spake 1696-15 again 3254-55 unto Ahaz, 271 saying, 559-2

7:11 Ask 7592-3 thee a sign 226 of the LORD 3068 thy God; 430 ask 7592-2 it either in the depth, 6009-54 or in the height 1361-53 above. 4605

7:12 But Ahaz 271 said, 559-4 I will not ask, 7592-4 neither will I tempt 5254-17 853 the LORD. 3068

7:13 And he said, 559-4 Hear 8085-3 ye now, O house 1004 of David; 1732 [Is it] a small thing 4592 for you to weary 3811-53 men, 582 but will ye weary 3811-55 my God 430 also?

7:14 Therefore the Lord 136 himself shall give 5414-4 you a sign; 226 Behold, a virgin 5959 shall conceive, 2030 and bear 3205-6 a son, 1121 and shall call 7121-1 his name 8034 Immanuel. 410 6005

7:15 Butter 2529 and honey 1706 shall he eat, 398-4 that he may know 3045-2 to refuse 3988-2 the evil, 7451 and choose 977-2 the good. 2896

7:16 For before the child 5288 shall know 3045-4 to refuse 3988-2 the evil, 7451 and choose 977-2 the good, 2896 the land 127 that thou abhorrest 6973-5 shall be forsaken 5800-11 of 6440 both 8147 her kings. 4428

7:17 The LORD 3068 shall bring 935-55 upon thee, and upon thy people, 5971 and upon thy father's 1 house, 1004 days 3117 that have not come, 935-1 from the day 3117 that Ephraim 669 departed 5493-2 from Judah; 3063 [even] the king 4428 of Assyria. 804

7:18 And it shall come to pass in that day, 3117 [that] the LORD 3068 shall hiss 8319-4 for the fly 2070 that [is] in the uttermost part 7097 of the rivers 2975 of Egypt, 4714 and for the bee 1682 that [is] in the land 776 of Assyria. 804

7:19 And they shall come, 935-1 and shall rest 5117-1 all of them in the desolate 1327 valleys, 5158 and in the holes 5357 of the rocks, 5553 and upon all thorns, 5285 and upon all bushes. 5097

7:20 In the same day 3117 shall the Lord 136 shave 1548-17 with a razor 8593 that is hired, 7917 [namely], by them beyond 5676 the river, 5104 by the king 4428 of Assyria, 804 the head, 7218 and the hair 8181 of the feet: 7272 and it shall also consume 5595-4 the beard. 2206

7:21 And it shall come to pass in that day, 3117 [that] a man 376 shall nourish 2421-17 a young cow, 5697 1241 and two 8147 sheep; 6629

7:22 And it shall come to pass, for the abundance 7230 of milk 2461 [that] they shall give 6213-2 he shall eat 398-4 butter: 2529 for butter 2529 and honey 1706 shall every one eat 398-4 that is left 3498-12 in 7130 the land. 776

7:23 And it shall come to pass in that day, 3117 [that] every place 4725 shall be, where there were a thousand 505 vines 1612 at a thousand 505 silverlings, 3701 it shall [even] be for briers 8068 and thorns. 7898

7:24 With arrows 2671 and with bows 7198 shall [men] come 935-4 thither; because all the land 776 shall become briers 8068 and thorns. 7898

7:25 And [on] all hills 2022 that shall be digged 5737-11 with the mattock, 4576 there shall not come 935-4 thither the fear 3374 of briers 8068 and thorns: 7898 but it shall be for the sending forth 4916 of oxen, 7794 and for the treading 4823 of lesser cattle. 7716

8:1 Moreover the LORD 3068 said 559-4 unto me, Take 3947-3 thee a great 1419 roll, 1549 and write 3789-3 in it with a man's 582 pen 2747 concerning Mahershalalhashbaz. 4116|7998|2363|957|4122

8:2 And I took unto me faithful 539-12 witnesses 5707 to record, 5749-55 Uriah 223 the priest, 3548 and Zechariah 2148 the son 1121 of Jeberechiah. 3000

8:3 And I went 7126-4 unto the prophetess; 5031 and she conceived, 2029-4 and bare 3205-4 a son. 1121 Then said 559-4 the LORD 3068 to me, Call 7121-3 his name 8034 Mahershalalhashbaz. 4116|7998|2363|957|4122

8:4 For before the child 5288 shall have knowledge 3045-4 to cry, 7121-2 My father, 1 and my mother, 517 the riches 2428 of Damascus 1834 and the spoil 7998 of Samaria 8111 shall be taken away 5375-4 before 6440 the king 4428 of Assyria. 804

8:5 The LORD 3068 spake 1696-15 also unto me again, 3254-55 saying, 559-2

8:6 Forasmuch as 3282 this people 5971 refuseth 3988-1 the waters 4325 of Shiloah 7975 that go 1980-6 softly, 328 and rejoice 4885 in Rezin 7526 and Remaliah's 7425 son; 1121

8:7 Now therefore, behold, the Lord 136 bringeth up 5927-56 upon them the waters 4325 of the river, 5104 strong 6099 and many, 7227 [even] the king 4428 of Assyria, 804 and all his glory: 3519 and he shall come up 5927-1 over all his channels, 650 and go over 1980-1 all his banks: 1415

8:8 And he shall pass 2498-1 through Judah; 3063 he shall overflow 7857-1 and go over, 5674-1 he shall reach 5060-55 [even] to the neck; 6677 and the stretching out 4298 of his wings 3671 shall fill 4393 the breadth 7341 of thy land, 776 O Immanuel. 6005 410

8:9 Associate 7489-3 yourselves, O ye people, 5971 and ye shall be broken in pieces; 2865-3 and give ear, 238-54 all 3605 ye of far 4801 countries: 776 gird 247-100 yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; 2865-3 gird 247-100 yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. 2865-3

8:10 Take counsel 6098 together, 5779-3 and it shall come to nought; 6565-93 speak 1696-16 the word, 1697 and it shall not stand: 6965-4 for God 410 [is] with us.

8:11 For the LORD 3068 spake 559-1 thus to me with a strong 2394 hand, 3027 and instructed 3256-14 me that I should not walk 3212-2 in the way 1870 of this people, 5971 saying, 559-2

8:12 Say 559-4 ye not, A confederacy, 7195 to all [them to] whom this people 5971 shall say, 559-4 A confederacy; 7195 neither fear 3372-4 ye their fear, 4172 nor be afraid. 6206-55

8:13 Sanctify 6942-55 the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 himself; and [let] him [be] your fear, 4172 and [let] him [be] your dread. 6206-56

8:14 And he shall be for a sanctuary; 4720 but for a stone 68 of stumbling 5063 and for a rock 6697 of offence 4383 to both 8147 the houses 1004 of Israel, 3478 for a gin 6341 and for a snare 4170 to the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem. 3389

8:15 And many 7227 among them shall stumble, 3782-1 and fall, 5307-1 and be broken, 7665-8 and be snared, 3369-8 and be taken. 3920-8

8:16 Bind up 6887-3 the testimony, 8584 seal 2856-3 the law 8451 among my disciples. 3928

8:17 And I will wait 2442-14 upon the LORD, 3068 that hideth 5641-56 his face 6440 from the house 1004 of Jacob, 3290 and I will look 6960-14 for him.

8:18 Behold, I and the children 3206 whom the LORD 3068 hath given 5414-1 me [are] for signs 226 and for wonders 4159 in Israel 3478 from the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 which dwelleth 7931-6 in mount 2022 Zion. 6726

8:19 And when they shall say 559-4 unto you, Seek 1875-3 unto them that have familiar spirits, 178 and unto wizards 3049 that peep, 6850-47 and that mutter: 1897-56 should not a people 5971 seek 1875-4 unto their God? 430 for the living 2416 to the dead? 4191-5

8:20 To the law 8451 and to the testimony: 8584 if they speak 559-4 not according to this word, 1697 [it is] because [there is] no light 7837 in them.

8:21 And they shall pass 5674-1 through it, hardly bestead 7185-12 and hungry: 7457 and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, 7456-4 they shall fret 7107-98 themselves, and curse 7043-14 their king 4428 and their God, 430 and look 6437-1 upward. 4605

8:22 And they shall look 5027-55 unto the earth; 776 and behold trouble 6869 and darkness, 2825 dimness 4588 of anguish; 6695 and [they shall be] driven 5080-30 to darkness. 653

9:1 Nevertheless the dimness 4155 [shall] not [be] such as [was] in her vexation, 4164 when 6256 at the first 7223 he lightly afflicted 7043-52 the land 776 of Zebulun 2074 and the land 776 of Naphtali, 5321 and afterward 314 did more grievously afflict 3513-52 [her by] the way 1870 of the sea, 3220 beyond 5676 Jordan, 3383 in Galilee 1551 of the nations. 1471

9:2 The people 5971 that walked 1980-6 in darkness 2822 have seen 7200-1 a great 1419 light: 216 they that dwell 3427-6 in the land 776 of the shadow of death, 6757 upon them hath the light 216 shined. 5050-1

9:3 Thou hast multiplied 7235-52 the nation, 1471 [and] not increased 1431-52 the joy: 8057 they joy 8055-1 before 6440 thee according to the joy 8057 in harvest, 7105 [and] as [men] rejoice 1523-4 when they divide 2505-15 the spoil. 7998

9:4 For thou hast broken 2865-52 the yoke 5923 of his burden, 5448 and the staff 4294 of his shoulder, 7926 the rod 7626 of his oppressor, 5065-6 as in the day 3117 of Midian. 4080

9:5 For every battle 5430 of the warrior 5431-6 [is] with confused noise, 7494 and garments 8071 rolled 1556-21 in blood; 1818 but [this] shall be with burning 8316 [and] fuel 3980 of fire. 784

9:6 For unto us a child 3206 is born, 3205-27 unto us a son 1121 is given: 5414-8 and the government 4951 shall be upon his shoulder: 7926 and his name 8034 shall be called 7121-4 Wonderful, 6382 Counsellor, 3289-6 The mighty 1368 God, 410 The everlasting 5703 Father, 1 The Prince 8269 of Peace. 7965

9:7 Of the increase 4766 of [his] government 4951 and peace 7965 [there shall be] no end, 7093 upon the throne 3678 of David, 1732 and upon his kingdom, 4467 to order 3559-53 it, and to establish 5582-2 it with judgment 4941 and with justice 6666 from henceforth even for 5704 ever. 5769 The zeal 7068 of the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 will perform 6213-4 this.

9:8 The Lord 136 sent 7971-1 a word 1697 into Jacob, 3290 and it hath lighted 5307-1 upon Israel. 3478

9:9 And all the people 5971 shall know, 3045-1 [even] Ephraim 669 and the inhabitant 3427-6 of Samaria, 8111 that say 559-2 in the pride 1346 and stoutness 1433 of heart, 3824

9:10 The bricks 3843 are fallen down, 5307-1 but we will build 1129-4 with hewn stones: 1496 the sycomores 8256 are cut down, 1438-27 but we will change 2498-55 [them into] cedars. 730

9:11 Therefore the LORD 3068 shall set up 7682-17 the adversaries 6862 of Rezin 7526 against him, and join his enemies 341-6 together; 5526-46

9:12 The Syrians 758 before, 6924 and the Philistines 6430 behind; 268 and they shall devour 398-4 Israel 3478 with open mouth. 6310 For all this his anger 639 is not turned away, 7725-1 but his hand 3027 [is] stretched out 5186-7 still.

9:13 For the people 5971 turneth 7725-1 not unto him that smiteth 5221-56 them, neither do they seek 1875-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts. 6635

9:14 Therefore the LORD 3068 will cut off 3772-55 from Israel 3478 head 7218 and tail, 2180 branch 3712 and rush, 100 in one 259 day. 3117

9:15 The ancient 2205 and honourable, 6440 5375-7 he 1931 [is] the head; 7218 and the prophet 5030 that teacheth 3384-56 lies, 8267 he 1931 [is] the tail. 2180

9:16 For the leaders 833-18 of this people 5971 cause [them] to err; 8582-56 and [they that are] led of them 833-30 [are] destroyed. 1104-30

9:17 Therefore the Lord 136 shall have no joy 8055-4 in their young men, 970 neither shall have mercy 7355-17 on their fatherless 3490 and widows: 490 for every one [is] an hypocrite 2611 and an evildoer, 7489-56 and every mouth 6310 speaketh 1696-6 folly. 5039 For all this his anger 639 is not turned away, 7725-1 but his hand 3027 [is] stretched out 5186-7 still.

9:18 For wickedness 7564 burneth 1197-1 as the fire: 784 it shall devour 398-4 the briers 8068 and thorns, 7898 and shall kindle 3341-4 in the thickets 5442 of the forest, 3293 and they shall mount up 55-101 [like] the lifting up 1348 of smoke. 6227

9:19 Through the wrath 5678 of the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 is the land 776 darkened, 6272-8 and the people 5971 shall be as the fuel 3980 of the fire: 784 no man 376 shall spare 2550-4 his brother. 251

9:20 And he shall snatch 1504-4 on the right hand, 3225 and be hungry; 7457 and he shall eat 398-4 on the left hand, 8040 and they shall not be satisfied: 7646-1 they shall eat 398-4 every man 376 the flesh 1320 of his own arm: 2220

9:21 Manasseh, 4519 Ephraim; 669 and Ephraim, 669 Manasseh: 4519 [and] they together 3162 [shall be] against Judah. 3063 For all this his anger 639 is not turned away, 7725-1 but his hand 3027 [is] stretched out 5186-7 still.

10:1 Woe 1945 unto them that decree 2710-6 unrighteous 205 decrees, 2711 and that write 3789-18 grievousness 5999 [which] they have prescribed; 3789-14

10:2 To turn aside 5186-53 the needy 1800 from judgment, 1779 and to take away 1497-2 the right 4941 from the poor 6041 of my people, 5971 that widows 490 may be their prey, 7998 and [that] they may rob 962-4 the fatherless! 3490

10:3 And what will ye do 6213-4 in the day 3117 of visitation, 6486 and in the desolation 7722 [which] shall come 935-4 from far? 4801 to whom will ye flee 5127-4 for help? 5833 and where will ye leave 5800-4 your glory? 3519

10:4 Without me 1115 they shall bow down 3766-1 under the prisoners, 616 and they shall fall 5307-4 under the slain. 2026-7 For all this his anger 639 is not turned away, 7725-1 but his hand 3027 [is] stretched out 5186-7 still.

10:5 O 1945 Assyrian, 804 the rod 7626 of mine anger, 639 and the staff 4294 in their hand 3027 is mine indignation. 2195

10:6 I will send 7971-17 him against an hypocritical 2611 nation, 1471 and against the people 5971 of my wrath 5678 will I give him a charge, 6680-17 to take 7997-2 the spoil, 7998 and to take 962-2 the prey, 957 and to tread them 7760-2 down 4823 like the mire 2563 of the streets. 2351

10:7 Howbeit he meaneth 1819-17 not so, neither doth his heart 3824 think 2803-4 so; but [it is] in his heart 3824 to destroy 8045-53 and cut off 3772-53 nations 1471 not a few. 4592

10:8 For he saith, 559-4 [Are] not my princes 8269 altogether 3162 kings? 4428

10:9 [Is] not Calno 3641 as Carchemish? 3751 [is] not Hamath 2574 as Arpad? 774 [is] not Samaria 8111 as Damascus? 1834

10:10 As my hand 3027 hath found 4672-1 the kingdoms 4467 of the idols, 457 and whose graven images 6456 did excel them of Jerusalem 3389 and of Samaria; 8111

10:11 Shall I not, as I have done 6213-1 unto Samaria 8111 and her idols, 457 so do 6213-4 to Jerusalem 3389 and her idols? 6091

10:12 Wherefore it shall come to pass, [that] when the Lord 136 hath performed 1214-17 his whole work 4639 upon mount 2022 Zion 6726 and on Jerusalem, 3389 I will punish 6485-4 the fruit 6529 of the stout 1433 heart 3824 of the king 4428 of Assyria, 804 and the glory 8597 of his high 7312 looks. 5869

10:13 For he saith, 559-1 By the strength 3581 of my hand 3027 I have done 6213-1 [it], and by my wisdom; 2451 for I am prudent: 995-8 and I have removed 5493-55 the bounds 1367 of the people, 5971 and have robbed 8154-22 their treasures, 6259|6264-k and I have put down 3381-55 the inhabitants 3427-6 like a valiant 47|3524-q [man]:

10:14 And my hand 3027 hath found 4672-4 as a nest 7064 the riches 2428 of the people: 5971 and as one gathereth 622-2 eggs 1000 [that are] left, 5800-7 have I gathered 622-1 all the earth; 776 and there was none that moved 5074-6 the wing, 3671 or opened 6475-6 the mouth, 6310 or peeped. 6850-47

10:15 Shall the axe 1631 boast 6286-101 itself against him that heweth 2672-6 therewith? [or] shall the saw 4883 magnify 1431-101 itself against him that shaketh 5130-56 it? as if the rod 7626 should shake 5130-53 [itself] against them that lift it up, 7311-56 [or] as if the staff 4294 should lift up 7311-53 [itself, as if it were] no wood. 6086

10:16 Therefore shall the Lord, 113 the Lord 136|3068-q of hosts, 6635 send 7971-17 among his fat ones 4924 leanness; 7332 and under his glory 3519 he shall kindle 3344-4 a burning 3350 like the burning of a fire. 784

10:17 And the light 216 of Israel 3478 shall be for a fire, 784 and his Holy One 6918 for a flame: 3852 and it shall burn 1197-1 and devour 398-1 his thorns 7898 and his briers 8068 in one 259 day; 3117

10:18 And shall consume 3615-17 the glory 3519 of his forest, 3293 and of his fruitful field, 3759 both soul 5315 and body: 1320 and they shall be as when a standardbearer 5263-6 fainteth. 4549-2

10:19 And the rest 7605 of the trees 6086 of his forest 3293 shall be few, 4557 that a child 5288 may write 3789-4 them.

10:20 And it shall come to pass in that day, 3117 [that] the remnant 7605 of Israel, 3478 and such as are escaped 6413 of the house 1004 of Jacob, 3290 shall no more 3254-55 again stay 8172-9 upon him that smote 5221-56 them; but shall stay 8172-8 upon the LORD, 3068 the Holy One 6918 of Israel, 3478 in truth. 571

10:21 The remnant 7605 shall return, 7725-4 [even] the remnant 7605 of Jacob, 3290 unto the mighty 1368 God. 410

10:22 For though thy people 5971 Israel 3478 be as the sand 2344 of the sea, 3220 [yet] a remnant 7605 of them shall return: 7725-4 the consumption 3631 decreed 2782-7 shall overflow 7857-6 with righteousness. 6663

10:23 For the Lord 136 GOD 3069 of hosts 6635 shall make 6213-6 a consumption, 3617 even determined, 2782-12 in the midst 7130 of all the land. 773

10:24 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD 3069 of hosts, 6635 O my people 5971 that dwellest 3427-6 in Zion, 6726 be not afraid 3372-4 of the Assyrian: 804 he shall smite 5221-55 thee with a rod, 7626 and shall lift up 5375-4 his staff 4294 against thee, after the manner 1870 of Egypt. 4714

10:25 For yet a very 4213 little while, 4592 and the indignation 2195 shall cease, 3615-1 and mine anger 639 in their destruction. 8399

10:26 And the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 shall stir up 5782-31 a scourge 7752 for him according to the slaughter 4347 of Midian 4080 at the rock 6697 of Oreb: 6159 and [as] his rod 4294 [was] upon the sea, 3220 so shall he lift it up 5375-1 after the manner 1870 of Egypt. 4714

10:27 And it shall come to pass in that day, 3117 [that] his burden 5448 shall be taken away 5493-4 from off thy shoulder, 7926 and his yoke 5923 from off thy neck, 6677 and the yoke 5923 shall be destroyed 2254-27 because 6440 of the anointing. 8081

10:28 He is come 935-1 to Aiath, 5857 he is passed 5674-1 to Migron; 4051 at Michmash 4363 he hath laid up 6485-55 his carriages: 3627

10:29 They are gone over 5674-1 the passage: 4569 they have taken up their lodging 4411 at Geba; 1387 Ramah 7414 is afraid; 2729-1 Gibeah 1390 of Saul 7586 is fled. 5127-1

10:30 Lift up 6670-16 thy voice, 6963 O daughter 1323 of Gallim: 1530|1554 cause it to be heard 7181-54 unto Laish, 3919 O poor 6041 Anathoth. 6068

10:31 Madmenah 4088 is removed; 5074-1 the inhabitants 3427-6 of Gebim 1356|1374 gather 5756-52 themselves to flee.

10:32 As yet shall he remain 5975-2 at Nob 5011 that day: 3117 he shall shake 5130-34 his hand 3027 [against] the mount 2022 of the daughter 1323|1004-k of Zion, 6726 the hill 1389 of Jerusalem. 3389

10:33 Behold, the Lord, 113 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 shall lop 5586-18 the bough 6288 with terror: 4637 and the high ones 7311-6 of stature 6967 [shall be] hewn down, 1438-7 and the haughty 1364 shall be humbled. 8213-4

10:34 And he shall cut down 5362-14 the thickets 5442 of the forest 3293 with iron, 1270 and Lebanon 3844 shall fall 5307-4 by a mighty one. 117

11:1 And there shall come forth 3318-1 a rod 2415 out of the stem 1503 of Jesse, 3448 and a Branch 5342 shall grow 6509-4 out of his roots: 8328

11:2 And the spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 shall rest 5117-1 upon him, the spirit 7307 of wisdom 2451 and understanding, 998 the spirit 7307 of counsel 6098 and might, 1369 the spirit 7307 of knowledge 1847 and of the fear 3374 of the LORD; 3068

11:3 And shall make him of quick understanding 7306-53 in the fear 3374 of the LORD: 3068 and he shall not judge 8199-4 after the sight 4758 of his eyes, 5869 neither reprove 3198-55 after the hearing 4926 of his ears: 241

11:4 But with righteousness 6664 shall he judge 8199-1 the poor, 1800 and reprove 3198-52 with equity 4334 for the meek 6035 of the earth: 776 and he shall smite 5221-52 the earth 776 with the rod 7626 of his mouth, 6310 and with the breath 7307 of his lips 8193 shall he slay 4191-55 the wicked. 7563

11:5 And righteousness 6664 shall be the girdle 232 of his loins, 4975 and faithfulness 530 the girdle 232 of his reins. 2504

11:6 The wolf 2061 also shall dwell 1481-1 with the lamb, 3532 and the leopard 5246 shall lie down 7257-4 with the kid; 1423 and the calf 5695 and the young lion 3715 and the fatling 4806 together; 3162 and a little 6996 child 5288 shall lead 5090-6 them.

11:7 And the cow 6510 and the bear 1677 shall feed; 7462-4 their young ones 3206 shall lie down 7257-4 together: 3162 and the lion 738 shall eat 398-4 straw 8401 like the ox. 1241

11:8 And the sucking child 3243-6 shall play 8173-43 on the hole 2352 of the asp, 6620 and the weaned child 1580-7 shall put 1911-1 his hand 3027 on the cockatrice' 6848 den. 3975

11:9 They shall not hurt 7489-55 nor destroy 7843-55 in all my holy 6944 mountain: 2022 for the earth 776 shall be full 4390-1 of the knowledge 1844 of the LORD, 3068 as the waters 4325 cover 3680-18 the sea. 3220

11:10 And in that day 3117 there shall be a root 8328 of Jesse, 3448 which shall stand 5975-6 for an ensign 5251 of the people; 5971 to it shall the Gentiles 1471 seek: 1875-4 and his rest 4496 shall be glorious. 3519

11:11 And it shall come to pass in that day, 3117 [that] the Lord 136 shall set his hand 3027 again 3254-55 the second time 8145 to recover 7069-2 the remnant 7605 of his people, 5971 which shall be left, 7604-11 from Assyria, 804 and from Egypt, 4714 and from Pathros, 6624 and from Cush, 3568 and from Elam, 5867 and from Shinar, 8152 and from Hamath, 2574 and from the islands 339 of the sea. 3220

11:12 And he shall set up 5375-1 an ensign 5251 for the nations, 1471 and shall assemble 622-1 the outcasts 1760-12 of Israel, 3478 and gather together 6908-17 the dispersed 5310-7 of Judah 3063 from the four 702 corners 3671 of the earth. 776

11:13 The envy 7068 also of Ephraim 669 shall depart, 5493-1 and the adversaries 6887-6 of Judah 3063 shall be cut off: 3772-11 Ephraim 669 shall not envy 7065-17 Judah, 3063 and Judah 3063 shall not vex 6887-4 Ephraim. 669

11:14 But they shall fly 5774-1 upon the shoulders 3802 of the Philistines 6430 toward the west; 3220 they shall spoil 962-4 them 1121 of the east 6924 together: 3162 they shall lay 4916 their hand 3027 upon Edom 123 and Moab; 4124 and the children 1121 of Ammon 5983 shall obey 4928 them.

11:15 And the LORD 3068 shall utterly destroy 2763-52 the tongue 3956 of the Egyptian 4714 sea; 3220 and with his mighty 5868 wind 7307 shall he shake 5130-52 his hand 3027 over the river, 5104 and shall smite 5221-52 it in the seven 7651 streams, 5158 and make [men] go over 1869-52 dryshod. 5275

11:16 And there shall be an highway 4546 for the remnant 7605 of his people, 5971 which shall be left, 7604-11 from Assyria; 804 like as 834 it was to Israel 3478 in the day 3117 that he came up 5927-2 out of the land 776 of Egypt. 4714

12:1 And in that day 3117 thou shalt say, 559-1 O LORD, 3068 I will praise 3034-55 thee: though thou wast angry 599-1 with me, thine anger 639 is turned away, 7725-4 and thou comfortedst 5162-17 me.

12:2 Behold, God 410 [is] my salvation; 3444 I will trust, 982-4 and not be afraid: 6342-4 for the LORD 3050 JEHOVAH 3068 [is] my strength 5797 and [my] song; 2176 he also is become my salvation. 3444

12:3 Therefore with joy 8342 shall ye draw 7579-1 water 4325 out of the wells 4599 of salvation. 3444

12:4 And in that day 3117 shall ye say, 559-1 Praise 3034-54 the LORD, 3068 call 7121-3 upon his name, 8034 declare 3045-54 his doings 5949 among the people, 5971 make mention 2142-54 that his name 8034 is exalted. 7682-12

12:5 Sing 2167-16 unto the LORD; 3068 for he hath done 6213-1 excellent things: 1348 this [is] known 3045-94|3045-30-k in all the earth. 776

12:6 Cry out 6670-16 and shout, 7442-3 thou inhabitant 3427-6 of Zion: 6726 for great 1419 [is] the Holy One 6918 of Israel 3478 in the midst 7130 of thee.

13:1 The burden 4853 of Babylon, 894 which Isaiah 3470 the son 1121 of Amoz 531 did see. 2372-1

13:2 Lift ye up 5375-3 a banner 5251 upon the high 8192-12 mountain, 2022 exalt 7311-54 the voice 6963 unto them, shake 5130-54 the hand, 3027 that they may go 935-4 into the gates 6607 of the nobles. 5081

13:3 I have commanded 6680-14 my sanctified ones, 6942-30 I have also called 7121-1 my mighty ones 1368 for mine anger, 639 [even] them that rejoice 5947 in my highness. 1346

13:4 The noise 6963 of a multitude 1995 in the mountains, 2022 like as 1823 of a great 7227 people; 5971 a tumultuous 7588 noise 6963 of the kingdoms 4467 of nations 1471 gathered 622-12 together: the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 mustereth 6485-18 the host 6635 of the battle. 4421

13:5 They come 935-6 from a far 4801 country, 776 from the end 7097 of heaven, 8064 [even] the LORD, 3068 and the weapons 3627 of his indignation, 2195 to destroy 2254-15 the whole land. 776

13:6 Howl 3213-54 ye; for the day 3117 of the LORD 3068 [is] at hand; 7138 it shall come 935-4 as a destruction 7701 from the Almighty. 7706

13:7 Therefore shall all hands 3027 be faint, 7503-4 and every man's 582 heart 3824 shall melt: 4549-11

13:8 And they shall be afraid: 926-8 pangs 6735 and sorrows 2256 shall take hold of them; 270-4 they shall be in pain 2342-4 as a woman that travaileth: 3205-6 they shall be amazed 8539-4 one 376 at another; 7453 their faces 6440 [shall be as] flames. 3851

13:9 Behold, the day 3117 of the LORD 3068 cometh, 935-1 cruel 394 both with wrath 5678 and fierce 2740 anger, 639 to lay 7760-2 the land 776 desolate: 8047 and he shall destroy 8045-55 the sinners 2400 thereof out of it.

13:10 For the stars 3556 of heaven 8064 and the constellations 3685 thereof shall not give 1984-55 their light: 216 the sun 8121 shall be darkened 2821-1 in his going forth, 3318-2 and the moon 3394 shall not cause her light 216 to shine. 5050-55

13:11 And I will punish 6485-1 the world 8398 for [their] evil, 7451 and the wicked 7563 for their iniquity; 5771 and I will cause the arrogancy 1347 of the proud 2086 to cease, 7673-52 and will lay low 8213-55 the haughtiness 1346 of the terrible. 6184

13:12 I will make a man 582 more precious 3365-55 than fine gold; 6337 even a man 120 than the golden wedge 3800 of Ophir. 211

13:13 Therefore I will shake 7264-55 the heavens, 8064 and the earth 776 shall remove 7493-4 out of her place, 4725 in the wrath 5678 of the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 and in the day 3117 of his fierce 2740 anger. 639

13:14 And it shall be as the chased 5080-94 roe, 6643 and as a sheep 6629 that no man taketh up: 6908-18 they shall every man 376 turn 6437-4 to his own people, 5971 and flee 5127-4 every one 376 into his own land. 776

13:15 Every one that is found 4672-12 shall be thrust through; 1856-11 and every one that is joined 5595-12 [unto them] shall fall 5307-4 by the sword. 2719

13:16 Their children 5768 also shall be dashed to pieces 7376-29 before their eyes; 5869 their houses 1004 shall be spoiled, 8155-11 and their wives 802 ravished. 7901-11|7693-11-k

13:17 Behold, I will stir up 5782-56 the Medes 4074 against them, which shall not regard 2803-4 silver; 3701 and [as for] gold, 2091 they shall not delight 2654-4 in it.

13:18 [Their] bows 7198 also shall dash the young men 5288 to pieces; 7376-17 and they shall have no pity 7355-17 on the fruit 6529 of the womb; 990 their eye 5869 shall not spare 2347-4 children. 1121

13:19 And Babylon, 894 the glory 6643 of kingdoms, 4467 the beauty 8597 of the Chaldees' 3778 excellency, 1347 shall be as when God 430 overthrew 4114 Sodom 5467 and Gomorrah. 6017

13:20 It shall never 3808 5331 be inhabited, 3427-4 neither shall it be dwelt 7931-4 in from generation 1755 to generation: 1755 neither shall the Arabian 6163 pitch tent 167-17 there; neither shall the shepherds 7462-6 make their fold 7257-55 there.

13:21 But wild beasts of the desert 6728 shall lie 7257-1 there; and their houses 1004 shall be full 4390-1 of doleful creatures; 255 and owls 1323 3284 shall dwell 7931-1 there, and satyrs 8163 shall dance 7540-17 there.

13:22 And the wild beasts of the islands 338 shall cry 6030-1 in their desolate houses, 490 and dragons 8577 in [their] pleasant 6027 palaces: 1964 and her time 6256 [is] near 7138 to come, 935-2 and her days 3117 shall not be prolonged. 4900-11

14:1 For the LORD 3068 will have mercy 7355-17 on Jacob, 3290 and will yet choose 977-1 Israel, 3478 and set 3240-52 them in their own land: 127 and the strangers 1616 shall be joined 3867-8 with them, and they shall cleave 5596-8 to the house 1004 of Jacob. 3290

14:2 And the people 5971 shall take 3947-1 them, and bring 935-52 them to their place: 4725 and the house 1004 of Israel 3478 shall possess 5157-98 them in the land 127 of the LORD 3068 for servants 5650 and handmaids: 8198 and they shall take them captives, 7617-6 whose captives 7617-6 they were; and they shall rule 7287-1 over their oppressors. 5065-6

14:3 And it shall come to pass in the day 3117 that the LORD 3068 shall give thee rest 5117-53 from thy sorrow, 6090 and from thy fear, 7267 and from the hard 7186 bondage 5656 wherein thou wast made to serve, 5647-27

14:4 That thou shalt take up 5375-1 this proverb 4912 against the king 4428 of Babylon, 894 and say, 559-1 How hath the oppressor 5065-6 ceased! 7673-1 the golden city 4062 ceased! 7673-1

14:5 The LORD 3068 hath broken 7665-1 the staff 4294 of the wicked, 7563 [and] the sceptre 7626 of the rulers. 4910-6

14:6 He who smote 5221-56 the people 5971 in wrath 5678 with a continual 1115 5627 stroke, 4347 he that ruled 7287-6 the nations 1471 in anger, 639 is persecuted, 4783 [and] none 1097 hindereth. 2820-1

14:7 The whole earth 776 is at rest, 5117-1 [and] is quiet: 8252-1 they break forth 6476-1 into singing. 7440

14:8 Yea, the fir trees 1265 rejoice 8055-1 at thee, [and] the cedars 730 of Lebanon, 3844 [saying], Since thou art laid down, 7901-1 no feller 3772-6 is come up 5927-4 against us.

14:9 Hell 7585 from beneath is moved 7264-1 for thee to meet 7125-2 [thee] at thy coming: 935-2 it stirreth up 5782-31 the dead 7496 for thee, [even] all the chief ones 6260 of the earth; 776 it hath raised up 6965-52 from their thrones 3678 all the kings 4428 of the nations. 1471

14:10 All they shall speak 6030-4 and say 559-4 unto thee, Art thou also become weak 2470-27 as we? art thou become like 4911-8 unto us?

14:11 Thy pomp 1347 is brought down 3381-90 to the grave, 7585 [and] the noise 1998 of thy viols: 5035 the worm 7415 is spread 3331-93 under thee, and the worms 8438 cover 4374 thee.

14:12 How art thou fallen 5307-1 from heaven, 8064 O Lucifer, 1966|3213-54 son 1121 of the morning! 7837 [how] art thou cut down 1438-8 to the ground, 776 which didst weaken 2522-6 the nations! 1471

14:13 For thou hast said 559-1 in thine heart, 3824 I will ascend 5927-4 into heaven, 8064 I will exalt 7311-55 my throne 3678 above 4605 the stars 3556 of God: 410 I will sit 3427-4 also upon the mount 2022 of the congregation, 4150 in the sides 3411 of the north: 6828

14:14 I will ascend 5927-4 above the heights 1116 of the clouds; 5645 I will be like 1819-101 the most High. 5945

14:15 Yet thou shalt be brought down 3381-93 to hell, 7585 to the sides 3411 of the pit. 953

14:16 They that see 7200-6 thee shall narrowly look 7688-55 upon thee, [and] consider 995-113 thee, [saying, Is] this the man 376 that made the earth 776 to tremble, 7264-56 that did shake 7493-56 kingdoms; 4467

14:17 [That] made 7760-1 the world 8398 as a wilderness, 4057 and destroyed 2040-1 the cities 5892 thereof; [that] opened 6605-1 not the house 1004 of his prisoners? 615

14:18 All the kings 4428 of the nations, 1471 [even] all of them, lie 7901-1 in glory, 3519 every one 376 in his own house. 1004

14:19 But thou art cast 7993-90 out of thy grave 6913 like an abominable 8581-12 branch, 5342 [and as] the raiment 3830 of those that are slain, 2026-7 thrust through 2944-30 with a sword, 2719 that go down 3381-6 to the stones 68 of the pit; 953 as a carcase 6297 trodden under feet. 947-94

14:20 Thou shalt not be joined 3161-4 with them in burial, 6900 because thou hast destroyed 7843-14 thy land, 776 [and] slain 2026-1 thy people: 5971 the seed 2233 of evildoers 7489-56 shall never 3808 5769 be renowned. 7121-11

14:21 Prepare 3559-54 slaughter 4293 for his children 1121 for the iniquity 5771 of their fathers; 1 that they do not 1077 rise, 6965-4 nor possess 3423-1 the land, 776 nor fill 4390-1 the face 6440 of the world 8398 with cities. 6145|5892-q

14:22 For I will rise up 6965-1 against them, saith 5002-7 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 and cut off 3772-52 from Babylon 894 the name, 8034 and remnant, 7605 and son, 5209 and nephew, 5220 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

14:23 I will also make 7760-1 it a possession 4180 for the bittern, 7090 and pools 98 of water: 4325 and I will sweep 2894-43 it with the besom 4292 of destruction, 8045-53 saith 5002-7 the LORD 3068 of hosts. 6635

14:24 The LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 hath sworn, 7650-8 saying, 559-2 Surely as I have thought, 1819-14 so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, 3289-1 [so] shall it stand: 6965-4

14:25 That I will break 7665-2 the Assyrian 804 in my land, 776 and upon my mountains 2022 tread him under foot: 947-4 then shall his yoke 5923 depart 5493-1 from off them, and his burden 5448 depart 5493-4 from off their shoulders. 7926

14:26 This [is] the purpose 6098 that is purposed 3289-7 upon the whole earth: 776 and this [is] the hand 3027 that is stretched out 5186-7 upon all the nations. 1471

14:27 For the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 hath purposed, 3289-1 and who shall disannul 6565-55 [it]? and his hand 3027 [is] stretched out, 5186-7 and who shall turn it back? 7725-55

14:28 In the year 8141 that king 4428 Ahaz 271 died 4194 was this burden. 4853

14:29 Rejoice 8055-4 not thou, whole Palestina, 6429 because the rod 7626 of him that smote 5221-56 thee is broken: 7665-8 for out of the serpent's 5175 root 8328 shall come forth 3318-4 a cockatrice, 6848 and his fruit 6529 [shall be] a fiery flying 5774-35 serpent. 8314

14:30 And the firstborn 1060 of the poor 1800 shall feed, 7462-1 and the needy 34 shall lie down 7257-4 in safety: 983 and I will kill 4191-52 thy root 8328 with famine, 7458 and he shall slay 2026-4 thy remnant. 7611

14:31 Howl, 3213-54 O gate; 8179 cry, 2199-3 O city; 5892 thou, whole Palestina, 6429 [art] dissolved: 4127-8 for there shall come 935-1 from the north 6828 a smoke, 6227 and none [shall be] alone 909-6 in his appointed times. 4151

14:32 What shall [one] then answer 6030-4 the messengers 4397 of the nation? 1471 That the LORD 3068 hath founded 3245-14 Zion, 6726 and the poor 6041 of his people 5971 shall trust 2620-4 in it.

15:1 The burden 4853 of Moab. 4124 Because in the night 3915 Ar 6144 of Moab 4124 is laid waste, 7703-27 [and] brought to silence; 1820-8 because in the night 3915 Kir 7024 of Moab 4124 is laid waste, 7703-27 [and] brought to silence; 1820-8

15:2 He is gone up 5927-1 to Bajith, 1006 and to Dibon, 1769 the high places, 1116 to weep: 1065 Moab 4124 shall howl 3213-55 over Nebo, 5015 and over Medeba: 4311 on all their heads 7218 [shall be] baldness, 7144 [and] every beard 2206 cut off. 1438-7

15:3 In their streets 2351 they shall gird 2296-1 themselves with sackcloth: 8242 on the tops 1406 of their houses, and in their streets, 7339 every one shall howl, 3213-55 weeping 1065 abundantly. 3381-6

15:4 And Heshbon 2809 shall cry, 2199-4 and Elealeh: 500 their voice 6963 shall be heard 8085-8 [even] unto Jahaz: 3096 therefore the armed soldiers 2502-7 of Moab 4124 shall cry out; 7321-55 his life 5315 shall be grievous 3415-1 unto him.

15:5 My heart 3820 shall cry out 2199-4 for Moab; 4124 his fugitives 1280 [shall flee] unto Zoar, 6820 an heifer 5697 of three years old: 7992 for by the mounting up 4608 of Luhith 3872 with weeping 1065 shall they go it up; 5927-4 for in the way 1870 of Horonaim 2773 they shall raise up 5782-34 a cry 2201 of destruction. 7667

15:6 For the waters 4325 of Nimrim 5249 shall be desolate: 4923 for the hay 2682 is withered away, 3001-1 the grass 1877 faileth, 3615-1 there is no green thing. 3418

15:7 Therefore the abundance 3502 they have gotten, 6213-1 and that which they have laid up, 6486 shall they carry away 5375-4 to the brook 5158 of the willows. 6155

15:8 For the cry 2201 is gone round about 5362-52 the borders 1366 of Moab; 4124 the howling 3215 thereof unto Eglaim, 97 and the howling 3215 thereof unto Beerelim. 879

15:9 For the waters 4325 of Dimon 1775 shall be full 4390-1 of blood: 1818 for I will bring 7896-4 more 3254-12 upon Dimon, 1775 lions 738 upon him that escapeth 6413 of Moab, 4124 and upon the remnant 7611 of the land. 127

16:1 Send 7971-3 ye the lamb 3733 to the ruler 4910-6 of the land 776 from Sela 5554 to the wilderness, 4057 unto the mount 2022 of the daughter 1323 of Zion. 6726

16:2 For it shall be, [that], as a wandering 5074-6 bird 5775 cast out 7971-30 of the nest, 7064 [so] the daughters 1323 of Moab 4124 shall be at the fords 4569 of Arnon. 769

16:3 Take 935-54 counsel, 6098 execute 6213-3 judgment; 6415 make 7896-3 thy shadow 6738 as the night 3915 in the midst 8432 of the noonday; 6672 hide 5641-16 the outcasts; 5080-12 bewray 1540-17 not him that wandereth. 5074-6

16:4 Let mine outcasts 5080-12 dwell 1481-4 with thee, Moab; 4124 be 1933-3 thou a covert 5643 to them from the face 6440 of the spoiler: 7703-6 for the extortioner 4160-5 is at an end, 656-1 the spoiler 7701 ceaseth, 3615-1 the oppressors 7429-6 are consumed 8552-1 out of the land. 776

16:5 And in mercy 2617 shall the throne 3678 be established: 3559-90 and he shall sit 3427-1 upon it in truth 571 in the tabernacle 168 of David, 1732 judging, 8199-6 and seeking 1875-6 judgment, 4941 and hasting 4106 righteousness. 6664

16:6 We have heard 8085-1 of the pride 1347 of Moab; 4124 [he is] very 3966 proud: 1341 [even] of his haughtiness, 1346 and his pride, 1347 and his wrath: 5678 [but] his lies 907 [shall] not [be] so.

16:7 Therefore shall Moab 4124 howl 3213-55 for Moab, 4124 every one shall howl: 3213-55 for the foundations 808 of Kirhareseth 7025 shall ye mourn; 1897-4 surely [they are] stricken. 5218

16:8 For the fields 7709 of Heshbon 2809 languish, 535-49 [and] the vine 1612 of Sibmah: 7643 the lords 1167 of the heathen 1471 have broken down 1986-1 the principal plants 8291 thereof, they are come 5060-1 [even] unto Jazer, 3270 they wandered 8582-1 [through] the wilderness: 4057 her branches 7976 are stretched out, 5203-8 they are gone over 5674-1 the sea. 3220

16:9 Therefore I will bewail 1058-4 with the weeping 1065 of Jazer 3270 the vine 1612 of Sibmah: 7643 I will water 7301-17 thee with my tears, 1832 O Heshbon, 2809 and Elealeh: 500 for the shouting 1959 for thy summer fruits 7019 and for thy harvest 7105 is fallen. 5307-1

16:10 And gladness 8057 is taken away, 622-8 and joy 1524 out of the plentiful field; 3759|3760 and in the vineyards 3754 there shall be no singing, 7442-29 neither shall there be shouting: 7321-37 the treaders 1869-6 shall tread out 1869-4 no wine 3196 in [their] presses; 3342 I have made [their vintage] shouting 1959 to cease. 7673-52

16:11 Wherefore my bowels 4578 shall sound 1993-4 like an harp 3658 for Moab, 4124 and mine inward parts 7130 for Kirharesh. 7025

16:12 And it shall come to pass, when it is seen 7200-8 that Moab 4124 is weary 3811-8 on the high place, 1116 that he shall come 935-1 to his sanctuary 4720 to pray; 6419-99 but he shall not prevail. 3201-4

16:13 This [is] the word 1697 that the LORD 3068 hath spoken 1696-14 concerning Moab 4124 since that time. 227

16:14 But now the LORD 3068 hath spoken, 1696-14 saying, 559-2 Within three 7969 years, 8141 as the years 8141 of an hireling, 7916 and the glory 3519 of Moab 4124 shall be contemned, 7034-8 with all that great 7227 multitude; 1995 and the remnant 7605 [shall be] very 4213 small 4592 [and] feeble. 3808 3524

17:1 The burden 4853 of Damascus. 1834 Behold, Damascus 1834 is taken away 5493-94 from [being] a city, 5892 and it shall be a ruinous 4654 heap. 4596

17:2 The cities 5892 of Aroer 6177 [are] forsaken: 5800-7 they shall be for flocks, 5739 which shall lie down, 7257-1 and none shall make [them] afraid. 2729-56

17:3 The fortress 4013 also shall cease 7673-8 from Ephraim, 669 and the kingdom 4467 from Damascus, 1834 and the remnant 7605 of Syria: 758 they shall be as the glory 3519 of the children 1121 of Israel, 3478 saith 5002-7 the LORD 3068 of hosts. 6635

17:4 And in that day 3117 it shall come to pass, [that] the glory 3519 of Jacob 3290 shall be made thin, 1809-11 and the fatness 4924 of his flesh 1320 shall wax lean. 7329-11

17:5 And it shall be as when the harvestman 7105 gathereth 622-2 the corn, 7054 and reapeth 7114-4 the ears 7641 with his arm; 2220 and it shall be as he that gathereth 3950-18 ears 7641 in the valley 6010 of Rephaim. 7497

17:6 Yet gleaning grapes 5955 shall be left 7604-8 in it, as the shaking 5363 of an olive tree, 2132 two 8147 [or] three 7969 berries 1620 in the top 7218 of the uppermost bough, 534 four 702 [or] five 2568 in the outmost fruitful 6509-6 branches 5585 thereof, saith 5002-7 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel. 3478

17:7 At that day 3117 shall a man 120 look 8159-4 to his Maker, 6213-6 and his eyes 5869 shall have respect 7200-4 to the Holy One 6918 of Israel. 3478

17:8 And he shall not look 8159-4 to the altars, 4196 the work 4639 of his hands, 3027 neither shall respect 7200-4 [that] which his fingers 676 have made, 6213-1 either the groves, 842 or the images. 2553

17:9 In that day 3117 shall his strong 4581 cities 5892 be as a forsaken 5800-7 bough, 2793 and an uppermost branch, 534 which they left 5800-1 because 6440 of the children 1121 of Israel: 3478 and there shall be desolation. 8077

17:10 Because thou hast forgotten 7911-1 the God 430 of thy salvation, 3468 and hast not been mindful 2142-1 of the rock 6697 of thy strength, 4581 therefore shalt thou plant 5193-4 pleasant 5282 plants, 5194 and shalt set 2232-4 it with strange 2114-5 slips: 2156

17:11 In the day 3117 shalt thou make thy plant 5194 to grow, 7735-46 and in the morning 1242 shalt thou make thy seed 2233 to flourish: 6524-55 [but] the harvest 7105 [shall be] a heap 5067 in the day 3117 of grief 2470-12 and of desperate 605-7 sorrow. 3511

17:12 Woe 1945 to the multitude 1995 of many 7227 people, 5971 [which] make a noise 1993-4 like the noise 1993-2 of the seas; 3220 and to the rushing 7588 of nations, 3816 [that] make a rushing 7582-11 like the rushing 7588 of mighty 3524 waters! 4325

17:13 The nations 3816 shall rush 7582-11 like the rushing 7588 of many 7227 waters: 4325 but [God] shall rebuke 1605-1 them, and they shall flee 5127-1 far off, 4801 and shall be chased 7291-27 as the chaff 4671 of the mountains 2022 before 6440 the wind, 7307 and like a rolling thing 1534 before 6440 the whirlwind. 5492

17:14 And behold at eveningtide 6256 6153 trouble; 1091 [and] before the morning 1242 he [is] not. This [is] the portion 2506 of them that spoil 8154-6 us, and the lot 1486 of them that rob 962-6 us.

18:1 Woe 1945 to the land 776 shadowing 6767 with wings, 3671 which [is] beyond 5676 the rivers 5104 of Ethiopia: 3568

18:2 That sendeth 7971-6 ambassadors 6735 by the sea, 3220 even in vessels 3627 of bulrushes 1573 upon 6440 the waters, 4325 [saying], Go, 3212-3 ye swift 7031 messengers, 4397 to a nation 1471 scattered 4900-30 and peeled, 4178-30 to a people 5971 terrible 3372-12 from their beginning hitherto; 1973 a nation 1471 meted out 6978 and trodden down, 4001 whose land 776 the rivers 5104 have spoiled! 958-1

18:3 All ye inhabitants 3427-6 of the world, 8398 and dwellers 7931-6 on the earth, 776 see 7200-4 ye, when he lifteth up 5375-2 an ensign 5251 on the mountains; 2022 and when he bloweth 8628-2 a trumpet, 7782 hear 8085-4 ye.

18:4 For so 3541 the LORD 3068 said 559-1 unto me, I will take my rest, 8252-4 and I will consider 5027-55 in my dwelling place 4349 like a clear 6703 heat 2527 upon herbs, 216 [and] like a cloud 5645 of dew 2919 in the heat 2527 of harvest. 7105

18:5 For afore 6440 the harvest, 7105 when the bud 6525 is perfect, 8552-2 and the sour grape 1155 is ripening 1580-6 in the flower, 5328 he shall both cut off 3772-1 the sprigs 2150 with pruning hooks, 4211 and take away 5493-52 [and] cut down 8456-52 the branches. 5189

18:6 They shall be left 5800-11 together 3162 unto the fowls 5861 of the mountains, 2022 and to the beasts 929 of the earth: 776 and the fowls 5861 shall summer 6972-1 upon them, and all the beasts 929 of the earth 776 shall winter 2778-4 upon them.

18:7 In that time 6256 shall the present 7862 be brought 2986-93 unto the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 of a people 5971 scattered 4900-30 and peeled, 4178-30 and from a people 5971 terrible 3372-12 from their beginning hitherto; 1973 a nation 1471 meted out 6978 and trodden under foot, 4001 whose land 776 the rivers 5104 have spoiled, 958-1 to the place 4725 of the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the mount 2022 Zion. 6726

19:1 The burden 4853 of Egypt. 4714 Behold, the LORD 3068 rideth 7392-6 upon a swift 7031 cloud, 5645 and shall come 935-1 into Egypt: 4714 and the idols 457 of Egypt 4714 shall be moved 5128-1 at his presence, 6440 and the heart 3824 of Egypt 4714 shall melt 4549-11 in the midst 7130 of it.

19:2 And I will set 5526-43 the Egyptians 4714 against the Egyptians: 4714 and they shall fight 3898-8 every one 376 against his brother, 251 and every one 376 against his neighbour; 7453 city 5892 against city, 5892 [and] kingdom 4467 against kingdom. 4467

19:3 And the spirit 7307 of Egypt 4714 shall fail 1238-8 in the midst 7130 thereof; and I will destroy 1104-17 the counsel 6098 thereof: and they shall seek 1875-1 to the idols, 457 and to the charmers, 328 and to them that have familiar spirits, 178 and to the wizards. 3049

19:4 And 853 the Egyptians 4714 will I give over 5534-14 into the hand 3027 of a cruel 7186 lord; 113 and a fierce 5794 king 4428 shall rule 4910-4 over them, saith 5002-7 the Lord, 113 the LORD 3068 of hosts. 6635

19:5 And the waters 4325 shall fail 5405-8 from the sea, 3220 and the river 5104 shall be wasted 2717-4 and dried up. 3001-1

19:6 And they shall turn the rivers 5104 far away; 2186-52 [and] the brooks 2975 of defence 4693|4692 shall be emptied 1809-1 and dried up: 2717-1 the reeds 7070 and flags 5488 shall wither. 7060-1

19:7 The paper reeds 6169 by the brooks, 2975 by the mouth 6310 of the brooks, 2975 and every thing sown 4218 by the brooks, 2975 shall wither, 3001-4 be driven away, 5086-8 and be no [more].

19:8 The fishers 1771 also shall mourn, 578-1 and all they that cast 7993-56 angle 2443 into the brooks 2975 shall lament, 56-1 and they that spread 6566-6 nets 4365 upon 6440 the waters 4325 shall languish. 535-49

19:9 Moreover they that work 5647-6 in fine 8305 flax, 6593 and they that weave 707-6 networks, 2355 shall be confounded. 954-1

19:10 And they shall be broken 1792-30 in the purposes 8356 thereof, all that make 6213-6 sluices 7938 [and] ponds 99|98 for fish. 5315

19:11 Surely the princes 8269 of Zoan 6814 [are] fools, 191 the counsel 6098 of the wise 2450 counsellors 3289-6 of Pharaoh 6547 is become brutish: 1197-12 how say 559-4 ye unto Pharaoh, 6547 I [am] the son 1121 of the wise, 2450 the son 1121 of ancient 6924 kings? 4428

19:12 Where [are] they? 335 where 645 [are] thy wise 2450 [men]? and let them tell 5046-55 thee now, and let them know 3045-4 what the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 hath purposed 3289-1 upon Egypt. 4714

19:13 The princes 8269 of Zoan 6814 are become fools, 2973-8 the princes 8269 of Noph 5297 are deceived; 5377-8 they have also seduced 8582-52 Egypt, 4714 [even they that are] the stay 6438 of the tribes 7626 thereof.

19:14 The LORD 3068 hath mingled 4537-1 a perverse 5773 spirit 7307 in the midst 7130 thereof: and they have caused Egypt 4714 to err 8582-52 in every work 4639 thereof, as a drunken 7910 [man] staggereth 8582-9 in his vomit. 6892

19:15 Neither shall there be [any] work 4639 for Egypt, 4714 which the head 7218 or tail, 2180 branch 3712 or rush, 100 may do. 6213-4

19:16 In that day 3117 shall Egypt 4714 be like unto women: 802 and it shall be afraid 2729-1 and fear 6342-1 because 6440 of the shaking 8573 of the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 which he shaketh 5130-56 over it.

19:17 And the land 127 of Judah 3063 shall be a terror 2283 unto Egypt, 4714 every one that maketh mention 2142-55 thereof shall be afraid 6342-4 in himself, because 6440 of the counsel 6098 of the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 which he hath determined 3289-6 against it.

19:18 In that day 3117 shall five 2568 cities 5892 in the land 776 of Egypt 4714 speak 1696-18 the language 8193 of Canaan, 3667 and swear 7650-12 to the LORD 3068 of hosts; 6635 one 259 shall be called, 559-11 The city 5892 of destruction. 2041

19:19 In that day 3117 shall there be an altar 4196 to the LORD 3068 in the midst 8432 of the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 and a pillar 4676 at 681 the border 1366 thereof to the LORD. 3068

19:20 And it shall be for a sign 226 and for a witness 5707 unto the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 in the land 776 of Egypt: 4714 for they shall cry 6817-4 unto the LORD 3068 because 6440 of the oppressors, 3905-5 and he shall send 7971-4 them a saviour, 3467-56 and a great one, 7227 and he shall deliver 5337-52 them.

19:21 And the LORD 3068 shall be known 3045-8 to Egypt, 4714 and the Egyptians 4714 shall know 3045-1 the LORD 3068 in that day, 3117 and shall do 5647-1 sacrifice 2077 and oblation; 4503 yea, they shall vow 5087-1 a vow 5088 unto the LORD, 3068 and perform 7999-14 [it].

19:22 And the LORD 3068 shall smite 5062-1 Egypt: 4714 he shall smite 5062-2 and heal 7495-2 [it]: and they shall return 7725-1 [even] to the LORD, 3068 and he shall be intreated 6279-8 of them, and shall heal 7495-1 them.

19:23 In that day 3117 shall there be a highway 4546 out of Egypt 4714 to Assyria, 804 and the Assyrian 804 shall come 935-1 into Egypt, 4714 and the Egyptian 4714 into Assyria, 804 and the Egyptians 4714 shall serve 5647-1 with the Assyrians. 804

19:24 In that day 3117 shall Israel 3478 be the third 7992 with Egypt 4714 and with Assyria, 804 [even] a blessing 1293 in the midst 7130 of the land: 776

19:25 Whom the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 shall bless, 1288-14 saying, 559-2 Blessed 1288-7 [be] Egypt 4714 my people, 5971 and Assyria 804 the work 4639 of my hands, 3027 and Israel 3478 mine inheritance. 5159

20:1 In the year 8141 that Tartan 8661 came 935-2 unto Ashdod, 795 (when Sargon 5623 the king 4428 of Assyria 804 sent 7971-2 him,) and fought 3898-11 against Ashdod, 795 and took 3920-4 it;

20:2 At the same time 6256 spake 1696-14 the LORD 3068 by 3027 Isaiah 3470 the son 1121 of Amoz, 531 saying, 559-2 Go 3212-3 and loose 6605-14 the sackcloth 8242 from off thy loins, 4975 and put off 2502-4 thy shoe 5275 from thy foot. 7272 And he did 6213-4 so, walking 1980-2 naked 6174 and barefoot. 3182

20:3 And the LORD 3068 said, 559-4 Like as my servant 5650 Isaiah 3470 hath walked 1980-1 naked 6174 and barefoot 3182 three 7969 years 8141 [for] a sign 226 and wonder 4159 upon Egypt 4714 and upon Ethiopia; 3568

20:4 So shall the king 4428 of Assyria 804 lead away 5090-4 the Egyptians 4714 prisoners, 7628 and the Ethiopians 3568 captives, 1546 young 5288 and old, 2205 naked 6174 and barefoot, 3182 even with [their] buttocks 8357 uncovered, 2834-7 to the shame 6172 of Egypt. 4714

20:5 And they shall be afraid 2865-1 and ashamed 954-1 of Ethiopia 3568 their expectation, 4007 and of Egypt 4714 their glory. 8597

20:6 And the inhabitant 3427-6 of this isle 339 shall say 559-1 in that day, 3117 Behold, such 3541 [is] our expectation, 4007 whither we flee 5127-1 for help 5833 to be delivered 5337-9 from 6440 the king 4428 of Assyria: 804 and how shall we escape? 4422-11

21:1 The burden 4853 of the desert 4057 of the sea. 3220 As whirlwinds 5492 in the south 5045 pass through; 2498-2 [so] it cometh 935-6 from the desert, 4057 from a terrible 3372-12 land. 776

21:2 A grievous 7186 vision 2380 is declared 5046-90 unto me; the treacherous dealer 898-6 dealeth treacherously, 898-6 and the spoiler 7703-6 spoileth. 7703-6 Go up, 5927-3 O Elam: 5867 besiege, 6696-3 O Media; 4074 all the sighing 585 thereof have I made to cease. 7673-52

21:3 Therefore are my loins 4975 filled 4390-1 with pain: 2479 pangs 6735 have taken hold upon me, 270-1 as the pangs 6735 of a woman that travaileth: 3205-6 I was bowed down 5753-8 at the hearing 8085-2 [of it]; I was dismayed 926-8 at the seeing 7200-2 [of it].

21:4 My heart 3824 panted, 8582-1 fearfulness 6427 affrighted 1204-14 me: the night 5399 of my pleasure 2837 hath he turned 7760-1 into fear 2731 unto me.

21:5 Prepare 6186-2 the table, 7979 watch 6822-2 in the watchtower, 6844 eat, 398-2 drink: 8354-2 arise, 6965-3 ye princes, 8269 [and] anoint 4886-3 the shield. 4043

21:6 For thus hath the Lord 136 said 559-1 unto me, Go, 3212-3 set 5975-54 a watchman, 6822-18 let him declare 5046-55 what he seeth. 7200-4

21:7 And he saw 7200-1 a chariot 7393 [with] a couple 6776 of horsemen, 6571 a chariot 7393 of asses, 2543 [and] a chariot 7393 of camels; 1581 and he hearkened 7181-52 diligently 7182 with much 7227 heed: 7182

21:8 And he cried, 7121-4 A lion: 738 My lord, 136 I stand 5975-6 continually 8548 upon the watchtower 4707 in the daytime, 3119 and I am set 5324-12 in my ward 4931 whole nights: 3915

21:9 And, behold, here cometh 935-6 a chariot 7393 of men, 376 [with] a couple 6776 of horsemen. 6571 And he answered 6030-4 and said, 559-4 Babylon 894 is fallen, 5307-1 is fallen; 5307-1 and all the graven images 6456 of her gods 430 he hath broken 7665-14 unto the ground. 776

21:10 O my threshing, 4098 and the corn 1121 of my floor: 1637 that which I have heard 8085-1 of the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 the God 430 of Israel, 3478 have I declared 5046-52 unto you.

21:11 The burden 4853 of Dumah. 1746 He calleth 7121-6 to me out of Seir, 8165 Watchman, 8104-6 what of the night? 3915 Watchman, 8104-6 what of the night? 3915

21:12 The watchman 8104-6 said, 559-1 The morning 1242 cometh, 857-1 and also the night: 3915 if ye will enquire, 1158-4 enquire 1158-3 ye: return, 7725-3 come. 857-3

21:13 The burden 4853 upon Arabia. 6152 In the forest 3293 in Arabia 6152 shall ye lodge, 3885-4 O ye travelling companies 736-6 of Dedanim. 1720

21:14 The inhabitants 3427-6 of the land 776 of Tema 8485 brought 857-52 water 4325 to him 7125-2 that was thirsty, 6771 they prevented 6923-14 with their bread 3899 him that fled. 5074-6

21:15 For they fled 5074-1 from 6440 the swords, 2719 from 6440 the drawn 5203-7 sword, 2719 and from 6440 the bent 1869-7 bow, 7198 and from 6440 the grievousness 3514 of war. 4421

21:16 For thus hath the Lord 136 said 559-1 unto me, Within a year, 8141 according to the years 8141 of an hireling, 7916 and all the glory 3519 of Kedar 6938 shall fail: 3615-1

21:17 And the residue 7605 of the number 4557 of archers, 7198 the mighty men 1368 of the children 1121 of Kedar, 6938 shall be diminished: 4591-4 for the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 hath spoken 1696-14 [it].

22:1 The burden 4853 of the valley 1516 of vision. 2384 What aileth thee now, 645 that thou art wholly gone up 5927-1 to the housetops? 1406

22:2 Thou that art full 4392 of stirs, 8663 a tumultuous 1993-6 city, 5892 a joyous 5947 city: 7151 thy slain 2491 [men are] not slain 2491 with the sword, 2719 nor dead 4191-5 in battle. 4421

22:3 All thy rulers 7101 are fled 5074-1 together, 3162 they are bound 631-27 by the archers: 7198 all that are found 4672-12 in thee are bound 631-27 together, 3162 [which] have fled 1272-1 from far. 7350

22:4 Therefore said 559-1 I, Look away 8159-3 from me; I will weep 1065 bitterly, 4843-17 labour 213-55 not to comfort 5162-15 me, because of the spoiling 7701 of the daughter 1323 of my people. 5971

22:5 For [it is] a day 3117 of trouble, 4103 and of treading down, 4001 and of perplexity 3998 by the Lord 136 GOD 3069 of hosts 6635 in the valley 1516 of vision, 2384 breaking down 6979-47 the walls, 7023 and of crying 7771 to the mountains. 2022

22:6 And Elam 5867 bare 5375-1 the quiver 827 with chariots 7393 of men 120 [and] horsemen, 6571 and Kir 7024 uncovered 6168-14 the shield. 4043

22:7 And it shall come to pass, [that] thy choicest 4005 valleys 6010 shall be full 4390-1 of chariots, 7393 and the horsemen 6571 shall set 7896-1 themselves in array 7896-2 at the gate. 8179

22:8 And he discovered 1540-17 the covering 4539 of Judah, 3063 and thou didst look 5027-55 in that day 3117 to the armour 5402 of the house 1004 of the forest. 3293

22:9 Ye have seen 7200-1 also the breaches 1233 of the city 5892 of David, 1732 that they are many: 7231-1 and ye gathered together 6908-17 the waters 4325 of the lower 8481 pool. 1295

22:10 And ye have numbered 5608-1 the houses 1004 of Jerusalem, 3389 and the houses 1004 have ye broken down 5422-4 to fortify 1219-15 the wall. 2346

22:11 Ye made 6213-1 also a ditch 4724 between the two walls 2346 for the water 4325 of the old 3465 pool: 1295 but ye have not looked 5027-52 unto the maker 6213-6 thereof, neither had respect 7200-1 unto him that fashioned 3335-6 it long ago. 7350

22:12 And in that day 3117 did the Lord 136 GOD 3069 of hosts 6635 call 7121-4 to weeping, 1065 and to mourning, 4553 and to baldness, 7144 and to girding 2296-2 with sackcloth: 8242

22:13 And behold joy 8342 and gladness, 8057 slaying 2026-2 oxen, 1241 and killing 7819-2 sheep, 6629 eating 398-2 flesh, 1320 and drinking 8354-2 wine: 3196 let us eat 398-2 and drink; 8354-2 for to morrow 4279 we shall die. 4191-4

22:14 And it was revealed 1540-8 in mine ears 241 by the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 Surely this iniquity 5771 shall not be purged 3722-29 from you till ye die, 4191-4 saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD 3069 of hosts. 6635

22:15 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD 3069 of hosts, 6635 Go, 3212-3 get 935-3 thee unto this treasurer, 5532-6 [even] unto Shebna, 7644 which [is] over the house, 1004 [and say],

22:16 What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out 2672-1 a sepulchre 6913 here, 6311 [as] he that heweth him out 2672-6 a sepulchre 6913 on high, 4791 [and] that graveth 2710-6 an habitation 4908 for himself in a rock? 5553

22:17 Behold, the LORD 3068 will carry thee away 2904-47 with a mighty 1397 captivity, 2925 and will surely 5844-2 cover 5844-6 thee.

22:18 He will surely 6801-2 violently turn 6801-4 and toss 6802 thee [like] a ball 1754 into a large 7342 3027 country: 776 there shalt thou die, 4191-4 and there the chariots 4818 of thy glory 3519 [shall be] the shame 7036 of thy lord's 113 house. 1004

22:19 And I will drive 1920-1 thee from thy station, 4673 and from thy state 4612 shall he pull thee down. 2040-4

22:20 And it shall come to pass in that day, 3117 that I will call 7121-1 my servant 5650 Eliakim 471 the son 1121 of Hilkiah: 2518

22:21 And I will clothe 3847-52 him with thy robe, 3801 and strengthen 2388-17 him with thy girdle, 73 and I will commit 5414-4 thy government 4475 into his hand: 3027 and he shall be a father 1 to the inhabitants 3427-6 of Jerusalem, 3389 and to the house 1004 of Judah. 3063

22:22 And the key 4668 of the house 1004 of David 1732 will I lay 5414-1 upon his shoulder; 7926 so he shall open, 6605-1 and none shall shut; 5462-6 and he shall shut, 5462-1 and none shall open. 6605-6

22:23 And I will fasten 8628-1 him [as] a nail 3489 in a sure 539-12 place; 4725 and he shall be for a glorious 3519 throne 3678 to his father's 1 house. 1004

22:24 And they shall hang 8518-1 upon him all the glory 3519 of his father's 1 house, 1004 the offspring 6631 and the issue, 6849 all vessels 3627 of small 6996 quantity, from the vessels 3627 of cups, 101 even to all the vessels 3627 of flagons. 5035

22:25 In that day, 3117 saith 5002-7 the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 shall the nail 3489 that is fastened 8628-7 in the sure 539-12 place 4725 be removed, 4185-4 and be cut down, 1438-8 and fall; 5307-1 and the burden 4853 that [was] upon it shall be cut off: 3772-8 for the LORD 3068 hath spoken 1696-14 [it].

23:1 The burden 4853 of Tyre. 6865 Howl, 3213-54 ye ships 591 of Tarshish; 8659 for it is laid waste, 7703-27 so that there is no house, 1004 no entering in: 935-2 from the land 776 of Chittim 3794 it is revealed 1540-8 to them.

23:2 Be still, 1826-3 ye inhabitants 3427-6 of the isle; 339 thou whom the merchants 5503-6 of Zidon, 6721 that pass over 5674-6 the sea, 3220 have replenished. 4390-14

23:3 And by great 7227 waters 4325 the seed 2233 of Sihor, 7883 the harvest 7105 of the river, 2975 [is] her revenue; 8393 and she is a mart 5505 of nations. 1471

23:4 Be thou ashamed, 954-3 O Zidon: 6721 for the sea 3220 hath spoken, 559-1 [even] the strength 4581 of the sea, 3220 saying, 559-2 I travail 2342-1 not, nor bring forth children, 3205-1 neither do I nourish up 1431-14 young men, 970 [nor] bring up 7311-31 virgins. 1330

23:5 As at the report 8088 concerning Egypt, 4714 [so] shall they be sorely pained 2342-4 at the report 8088 of Tyre. 6865

23:6 Pass ye over 5674-3 to Tarshish; 8659 howl, 3213-54 ye inhabitants 3427-6 of the isle. 339

23:7 [Is] this your joyous 5947 [city], whose antiquity 6927 [is] of ancient 6924 days? 3117 her own feet 7272 shall carry 2986-55 her afar off 7350 to sojourn. 1481-2

23:8 Who hath taken this counsel 3289-1 against Tyre, 6865 the crowning 5849-56 [city], whose merchants 5503-6 [are] princes, 8269 whose traffickers 3667 [are] the honourable 3513-12 of the earth? 776

23:9 The LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 hath purposed 3289-1 it, to stain 2490-15 the pride 1347 of all glory, 6643 [and] to bring into contempt 7043-53 all the honourable 3513-12 of the earth. 776

23:10 Pass through 5674-3 thy land 776 as a river, 2975 O daughter 1323 of Tarshish: 8659 [there is] no more strength. 4206

23:11 He stretched out 5186-1 his hand 3027 over the sea, 3220 he shook 7264-52 the kingdoms: 4467 the LORD 3068 hath given a commandment 6680-14 against the merchant 3667 [city], to destroy 8045-53 the strong holds 4581 thereof.

23:12 And he said, 559-4 Thou shalt no more 3254-55 rejoice, 5937-2 O thou oppressed 6231-30 virgin, 1330 daughter 1323 of Zidon: 6721 arise, 6965-3 pass over 5674-3 to Chittim; 3794 there also shalt thou have no rest. 5117-4

23:13 Behold the land 776 of the Chaldeans; 3778 this people 5971 was not, [till] the Assyrian 804 founded 3245-1 it for them that dwell in the wilderness: 6728 they set up 6965-52 the towers 971 thereof, they raised up 6209-22 the palaces 759 thereof; [and] he brought 7760-1 it to ruin. 4654

23:14 Howl, 3213-54 ye ships 591 of Tarshish: 8659 for your strength 4581 is laid waste. 7703-27

23:15 And it shall come to pass in that day, 3117 that Tyre 6865 shall be forgotten 7911-12 seventy 7657 years, 8141 according to the days 3117 of one 259 king: 4428 after the end 7093 of seventy 7657 years 8141 shall Tyre 6865 sing 7892 as an harlot. 2181-6

23:16 Take 3947-3 an harp, 3658 go about 5437-3 the city, 5892 thou harlot 2181-6 that hast been forgotten; 7911-12 make sweet 3190-54 melody, 5059-15 sing many 7235-54 songs, 7892 that thou mayest be remembered. 2142-11

23:17 And it shall come to pass after the end 7093 of seventy 7657 years, 8141 that the LORD 3068 will visit 6485-4 Tyre, 6865 and she shall turn 7725-1 to her hire, 868 and shall commit fornication 2181-1 with all the kingdoms 4467 of the world 776 upon the face 6440 of the earth. 127

23:18 And her merchandise 5504 and her hire 868 shall be holiness 6944 to the LORD: 3068 it shall not be treasured 686-11 nor laid up; 2630-11 for her merchandise 5504 shall be for them that dwell 3427-6 before 6440 the LORD, 3068 to eat 398-2 sufficiently, 7654 and for durable 6266 clothing. 4374

24:1 Behold, the LORD 3068 maketh the earth 776 empty, 1238-6 and maketh it waste, 1110-6 and turneth 5753-14 it upside down, 6440 and scattereth abroad 6327-52 the inhabitants 3427-6 thereof.

24:2 And it shall be, as with the people, 5971 so with the priest; 3548 as with the servant, 5650 so with his master; 113 as with the maid, 8198 so with her mistress; 1404 as with the buyer, 7069-6 so with the seller; 4376-6 as with the lender, 3867-56 so with the borrower; 3867-5 as with the taker of usury, 5383-6 so with 834 the giver of usury 5378-5 to him.

24:3 The land 776 shall be utterly 1238-9 emptied, 1238-11 and utterly 962-9 spoiled: 962-11 for the LORD 3068 hath spoken 1696-14 this word. 1697

24:4 The earth 776 mourneth 56-1 [and] fadeth away, 5034-1 the world 8398 languisheth 535-49 [and] fadeth away, 5034-1 the haughty 4791 people 5971 of the earth 776 do languish. 535-49

24:5 The earth 776 also is defiled 2610-1 under the inhabitants 3427-6 thereof; because they have transgressed 5674-1 the laws, 8451 changed 2498-1 the ordinance, 2706 broken 6565-52 the everlasting 5769 covenant. 1285

24:6 Therefore hath the curse 423 devoured 398-1 the earth, 776 and they that dwell 3427-6 therein are desolate: 816-4 therefore the inhabitants 3427-6 of the earth 776 are burned, 2787-1 and few 4213 men 582 left. 7604-8

24:7 The new wine 8492 mourneth, 56-1 the vine 1612 languisheth, 535-49 all the merryhearted 8056 3820 do sigh. 584-8

24:8 The mirth 4885 of tabrets 8596 ceaseth, 7673-1 the noise 7588 of them that rejoice 5947 endeth, 2308-1 the joy 4885 of the harp 3658 ceaseth. 7673-1

24:9 They shall not drink 8354-4 wine 3196 with a song; 7892 strong drink 7941 shall be bitter 4843-4 to them that drink 8354-6 it.

24:10 The city 7151 of confusion 8414 is broken down: 7665-8 every house 1004 is shut up, 5462-27 that no man may come in. 935-2

24:11 [There is] a crying 6682 for wine 3196 in the streets; 2351 all joy 8057 is darkened, 6150-1 the mirth 4885 of the land 776 is gone. 1540-1

24:12 In the city 5892 is left 7604-8 desolation, 8047 and the gate 8179 is smitten 3807-93 with destruction. 7591

24:13 When thus it shall be in the midst 7130 of the land 776 among 8432 the people, 5971 [there shall be] as the shaking 5363 of an olive tree, 2132 [and] as the gleaning grapes 5955 when the vintage 1210 is done. 3615-1

24:14 They shall lift up 5375-4 their voice, 6963 they shall sing 7442-4 for the majesty 1347 of the LORD, 3068 they shall cry aloud 6670-1 from the sea. 3220

24:15 Wherefore glorify 3513-16 ye the LORD 3068 in the fires, 217 [even] the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel 3478 in the isles 339 of the sea. 3220

24:16 From the uttermost part 3671 of the earth 776 have we heard 8085-1 songs, 2158 [even] glory 6643 to the righteous. 6662 But I said, 559-4 My leanness, 7334 my leanness, 7334 woe 188 unto me! the treacherous dealers 898-6 have dealt treacherously; 898-1 yea, the treacherous dealers 898-6 have dealt very 899 treacherously. 898-1

24:17 Fear, 6343 and the pit, 6354 and the snare, 6341 [are] upon thee, O inhabitant 3427-6 of the earth. 776

24:18 And it shall come to pass, [that] he who fleeth 5127-5 from the noise 6963 of the fear 6343 shall fall 5307-4 into the pit; 6354 and he that cometh up 5927-6 out of the midst 8432 of the pit 6354 shall be taken 3920-11 in the snare: 6341 for the windows 699 from on high 4791 are open, 6605-8 and the foundations 4144 of the earth 776 do shake. 7493-4

24:19 The earth 776 is utterly 7489-2 broken down, 7489-110 the earth 776 is clean 6565-2 dissolved, 6565-105 the earth 776 is moved 4131-98 exceedingly. 4131-2

24:20 The earth 776 shall reel 5128-4 to and fro 5128-2 like a drunkard, 7910 and shall be removed 5110-110 like a cottage; 4412 and the transgression 6588 thereof shall be heavy 3513-1 upon it; and it shall fall, 5307-1 and not rise 6965-2 again. 3254-55

24:21 And it shall come to pass in that day, 3117 [that] the LORD 3068 shall punish 6485-4 the host 6635 of the high ones 4791 [that are] on high, 4791 and the kings 4428 of the earth 127 upon the earth. 127

24:22 And they shall be gathered 622-27 together, 626 [as] prisoners 616 are gathered in the pit, 953 and shall be shut up 5462-27 in the prison, 4525 and after many 7230 days 3117 shall they be visited. 6485-11

24:23 Then the moon 3842 shall be confounded, 2659-1 and the sun 2535 ashamed, 954-1 when the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 shall reign 4427-1 in mount 2022 Zion, 6726 and in Jerusalem, 3389 and before his ancients 2205 gloriously. 3519

25:1 O LORD, 3068 thou [art] my God; 430 I will exalt 7311-34 thee, I will praise 3034-55 thy name; 8034 for thou hast done 6213-1 wonderful 6382 [things; thy] counsels 6098 of old 7350 [are] faithfulness 530 [and] truth. 544

25:2 For thou hast made 7760-1 of a city 5892 an heap; 1530 [of] a defenced 1219-7 city 7151 a ruin: 4654 a palace 759 of strangers 2114-5 to be no city; 5892 it shall never 3808 5769 be built. 1129-11

25:3 Therefore shall the strong 5794 people 5971 glorify 3513-17 thee, the city 7151 of the terrible 6184 nations 1471 shall fear 3372-4 thee.

25:4 For thou hast been a strength 4581 to the poor, 1800 a strength 4581 to the needy 34 in his distress, 6862 a refuge 4268 from the storm, 2230 a shadow 6738 from the heat, 2721 when the blast 7307 of the terrible ones 6184 [is] as a storm 2230 [against] the wall. 7023

25:5 Thou shalt bring down 3665-55 the noise 7588 of strangers, 2114-5 as the heat 2721 in a dry place; 6724 [even] the heat 2721 with the shadow 6738 of a cloud: 5645 the branch 2159 of the terrible ones 6184 shall be brought low. 6030-4

25:6 And in this mountain 2022 shall the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 make 6213-1 unto all people 5971 a feast 4960 of fat things, 8081 a feast 4960 of wines on the lees, 8105 of fat things 8081 full of marrow, 4229-30 of wines on the lees 8105 well refined. 2212-30

25:7 And he will destroy 1104-14 in this mountain 2022 the face 6440 of the covering 3875 cast 3874-6 over all people, 5971 and the vail 4541 that is spread 5259-7 over all nations. 1471

25:8 He will swallow up 1104-14 death 4194 in victory; 5331 and the Lord 136 GOD 3069 will wipe away 4229-1 tears 1832 from off all faces; 6440 and the rebuke 2781 of his people 5971 shall he take away 5493-55 from off all the earth: 776 for the LORD 3068 hath spoken 1696-14 [it].

25:9 And it shall be said 559-1 in that day, 3117 Lo, this [is] our God; 430 we have waited 6960-14 for him, and he will save 3467-55 us: this [is] the LORD; 3068 we have waited 6960-14 for him, we will be glad 1523-4 and rejoice 8055-4 in his salvation. 3444

25:10 For in this mountain 2022 shall the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 rest, 5117-4 and Moab 4124 shall be trodden down 1758-8 under him, even as straw 4963 is trodden down 1758-9 for 1119|4325-k the dunghill. 4087

25:11 And he shall spread forth 6566-14 his hands 3027 in the midst 7130 of them, as he that swimmeth 7811-6 spreadeth forth 6566-17 [his hands] to swim: 7811-2 and he shall bring down 8213-52 their pride 1346 together with the spoils 698 of their hands. 3027

25:12 And the fortress 4013 of the high fort 4869 of thy walls 2346 shall he bring down, 7817-52 lay low, 8213-52 [and] bring 5060-52 to the ground, 776 [even] to the dust. 6083

26:1 In that day 3117 shall this song 7892 be sung 7891-93 in the land 776 of Judah; 3063 We have a strong 5797 city; 5892 salvation 3444 will [God] appoint 7896-4 [for] walls 2346 and bulwarks. 2426

26:2 Open 6605-3 ye the gates, 8179 that the righteous 6662 nation 1471 which keepeth 8104-6 the truth 529 may enter in. 935-4

26:3 Thou wilt keep 5341-4 [him] in perfect 7965 peace, 7965 [whose] mind 3336 [is] stayed 5564-7 [on thee]: because he trusteth 982-7 in thee.

26:4 Trust 982-3 ye in the LORD 3068 for ever: 5703 for in the LORD 3050 JEHOVAH 3068 [is] everlasting 5769 strength: 6697

26:5 For he bringeth down 7817-52 them that dwell 3427-6 on high; 4791 the lofty 7682-12 city, 7151 he layeth it low; 8213-55 he layeth it low, 8213-55 [even] to the ground; 776 he bringeth 5060-55 it [even] to the dust. 6083

26:6 The foot 7272 shall tread it down, 7429-4 [even] the feet 7272 of the poor, 6041 [and] the steps 6471 of the needy. 1800

26:7 The way 734 of the just 6662 [is] uprightness: 4339 thou, most upright, 3477 dost weigh 6424-17 the path 4570 of the just. 6662

26:8 Yea, in the way 734 of thy judgments, 4941 O LORD, 3068 have we waited 6960-14 for thee; the desire 8378 of [our] soul 5315 [is] to thy name, 8034 and to the remembrance 2143 of thee.

26:9 With my soul 5315 have I desired 183-14 thee in the night; 3915 yea, with my spirit 7307 within 7130 me will I seek thee early: 7836-17 for when thy judgments 4941 [are] in the earth, 776 the inhabitants 3427-6 of the world 8398 will learn 3925-1 righteousness. 6664

26:10 Let favour be shewed 2603-90 to the wicked, 7563 [yet] will he not 1077 learn 3925-1 righteousness: 6664 in the land 776 of uprightness 5229 will he deal unjustly, 5765-17 and will not 1077 behold 7200-4 the majesty 1348 of the LORD. 3068

26:11 LORD, 3068 [when] thy hand 3027 is lifted up, 7311-1 they will not see: 2372-4 [but] they shall see, 2372-4 and be ashamed 954-4 for [their] envy 7068 at the people; 5971 yea, the fire 784 of thine enemies 6862 shall devour 398-4 them.

26:12 LORD, 3068 thou wilt ordain 8239-4 peace 7965 for us: for thou also hast wrought 6466-1 all our works 4639 in us.

26:13 O LORD 3068 our God, 430 [other] lords 113 beside 2108 thee have had dominion 1166-1 over us: [but] by thee only will we make mention 2142-55 of thy name. 8034

26:14 [They are] dead, 4191-5 they shall not live; 2421-4 [they are] deceased, 7496 they shall not rise: 6965-4 therefore hast thou visited 6485-1 and destroyed 8045-55 them, and made all their memory 2143 to perish. 6-17

26:15 Thou hast increased 3254-1 the nation, 1471 O LORD, 3068 thou hast increased 3254-1 the nation: 1471 thou art glorified: 3513-8 thou hadst removed [it] far 7368-14 [unto] all the ends 7099 of the earth. 776

26:16 LORD, 3068 in trouble 6862 have they visited 6485-1 thee, they poured out 6694-1 a prayer 3908 [when] thy chastening 4148 [was] upon them.

26:17 Like 3644 as a woman with child, 2030 [that] draweth near 7126-55 the time of her delivery, 3205-2 is in pain, 2342-4 [and] crieth out 2199-4 in her pangs; 2256 so have we been in thy sight, 6440 O LORD. 3068

26:18 We have been with child, 2029-1 we have been in pain, 2342-1 we have as it were 3644 brought forth 3205-1 wind; 7307 we have not 1077 wrought 6213-4 any deliverance 3444 in the earth; 776 neither 1077 have the inhabitants 3427-6 of the world 8398 fallen. 5307-4

26:19 Thy dead 4191-5 [men] shall live, 2421-4 [together with] my dead body 5038 shall they arise. 6965-4 Awake 6974-54 and sing, 7442-16 ye that dwell 7931-6 in dust: 6083 for thy dew 2919 [is as] the dew 2919 of herbs, 219 and the earth 776 shall cast out 5307-55 the dead. 7496

26:20 Come, 3212-3 my people, 5971 enter 935-3 thou into thy chambers, 2315 and shut 5462-3 thy doors 1817 about thee: hide 2247-3 thyself as it were for a little 4592 moment, 7281 until the indignation 2195 be overpast. 5674-4

26:21 For, behold, the LORD 3068 cometh out 3318-6 of his place 4725 to punish 6485-2 the inhabitants 3427-6 of the earth 776 for their iniquity: 5771 the earth 776 also shall disclose 1540-14 her blood, 1818 and shall no more cover 3680-17 her slain. 2026-7

27:1 In that day 3117 the LORD 3068 with his sore 7186 and great 1419 and strong 2389 sword 2719 shall punish 6485-4 leviathan 3882 the piercing 1281 serpent, 5175 even leviathan 3882 that crooked 6129 serpent; 5175 and he shall slay 2026-1 the dragon 8577 that [is] in the sea. 3220

27:2 In that day 3117 sing 6031-16 ye unto her, A vineyard 3754 of red wine. 2561|2531-q

27:3 I the LORD 3068 do keep 5341-6 it; I will water 8248-55 it every moment: 7281 lest [any] hurt 6485-4 it, I will keep 5341-4 it night 3915 and day. 3117

27:4 Fury 2534 [is] not in me: who would set 5414-4 the briers 8068 [and] thorns 7898 against me in battle? 4421 I would go 6585-4 through them, I would burn 6702-55 them together. 3162

27:5 Or let him take hold 2388-55 of my strength, 4581 [that] he may make 6213-4 peace 7965 with me; [and] he shall make 6213-4 peace 7965 with me.

27:6 He shall cause them that come 935-6 of Jacob 3290 to take root: 8327-55 Israel 3478 shall blossom 6692-55 and bud, 6524-1 and fill 4390-1 the face 6440 of the world 8398 with fruit. 8570

27:7 Hath he smitten 5221-52 him, as he smote 4347 those that smote 5221-56 him? [or] is he slain 2026-27 according to the slaughter 2027 of them that are slain 2026-7 by him?

27:8 In measure, 5432 when it shooteth forth, 7971-15 thou wilt debate 7378-4 with it: he stayeth 1898-1 his rough 7186 wind 7307 in the day 3117 of the east wind. 6921

27:9 By this 2063 therefore shall the iniquity 5771 of Jacob 3290 be purged; 3722-29 and this [is] all the fruit 6529 to take away 5493-53 his sin; 2403 when he maketh 7760-2 all the stones 68 of the altar 4196 as chalkstones 68 1615 that are beaten in sunder, 5310-30 the groves 842 and images 2553 shall not stand up. 6965-4

27:10 Yet the defenced 1219-7 city 5892 [shall be] desolate, 910 [and] the habitation 5116 forsaken, 7971-30 and left 5800-12 like a wilderness: 4057 there shall the calf 5695 feed, 7462-4 and there shall he lie down, 7257-4 and consume 3615-14 the branches 5585 thereof.

27:11 When the boughs 7105 thereof are withered, 3001-2 they shall be broken off: 7665-11 the women 802 come, 935-6 [and] set them on fire: 215-56 for it [is] a people 5971 of no understanding: 998 therefore he that made 6213-6 them will not have mercy 7355-17 on them, and he that formed 3335-6 them will shew them no favour. 2603-4

27:12 And it shall come to pass in that day, 3117 [that] the LORD 3068 shall beat off 2251-4 from the channel 7641 of the river 5104 unto the stream 5158 of Egypt, 4714 and ye shall be gathered 3950-29 one 259 by one, 259 O ye children 1121 of Israel. 3478

27:13 And it shall come to pass in that day, 3117 [that] the great 1419 trumpet 7782 shall be blown, 8628-11 and they shall come 935-1 which were ready to perish 6-6 in the land 776 of Assyria, 804 and the outcasts 5080-12 in the land 776 of Egypt, 4714 and shall worship 7812-98 the LORD 3068 in the holy 6944 mount 2022 at Jerusalem. 3389

28:1 Woe 1945 to the crown 5850 of pride, 1348 to the drunkards 7910 of Ephraim, 669 whose glorious 6643 beauty 8597 [is] a fading 5034-6 flower, 6731 which [are] on the head 7218 of the fat 8081 valleys 1516 of them that are overcome 1986-7 with wine! 3196

28:2 Behold, the Lord 136 hath a mighty 2389 and strong 533 one, [which] as a tempest 2230 of hail 1259 [and] a destroying 6986 storm, 8178 as a flood 2230 of mighty 3524 waters 4325 overflowing, 7857-6 shall cast down 3240-52 to the earth 776 with the hand. 3027

28:3 The crown 5850 of pride, 1348 the drunkards 7910 of Ephraim, 669 shall be trodden 7429-11 under feet: 7272

28:4 And the glorious 6643 beauty, 8597 which [is] on the head 7218 of the fat 8081 valley, 1516 shall be a fading 5034-6 flower, 6733 [and] as the hasty fruit 1061 before the summer; 7019 which [when] he that looketh 7200-6 upon it seeth, 7200-4 while it is yet in his hand 3709 he eateth it up. 1104-4

28:5 In that day 3117 shall the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 be for a crown 5850 of glory, 6643 and for a diadem 6843 of beauty, 8597 unto the residue 7605 of his people, 5971

28:6 And for a spirit 7307 of judgment 4941 to him that sitteth 3427-6 in judgment, 4941 and for strength 1369 to them that turn 7725-56 the battle 4421 to the gate. 8179

28:7 But they 428 also have erred 7686-1 through wine, 3196 and through strong drink 7941 are out of the way; 8582-1 the priest 3548 and the prophet 5030 have erred 7686-1 through 4480 strong drink, 7941 they are swallowed up 1104-8 of 4480 wine, 3196 they are out of the way 8582-1 through strong drink; 7941 they err 7686-1 in vision, 7203 they stumble 6328-1 [in] judgment. 6417

28:8 For all tables 7979 are full 4390-1 of vomit 6892 [and] filthiness, 6675 [so that there is] no place 4725 [clean].

28:9 Whom shall he teach 3384-55 knowledge? 1844 and whom shall he make to understand 995-4 doctrine? 8052 [them that are] weaned 1580-7 from the milk, 2461 [and] drawn 6267 from the breasts. 7699

28:10 For precept 6673 [must be] upon precept, 6673 precept 6673 upon precept; 6673 line 6957 upon line, 6957 line 6957 upon line; 6957 here a little, 2191 [and] there a little: 2191

28:11 For with stammering 3934 lips 8193 and another 312 tongue 3956 will he speak 1696-17 to this people. 5971

28:12 To whom he said, 559-1 This [is] the rest 4496 [wherewith] ye may cause the weary 5889 to rest; 5117-54 and this [is] the refreshing: 4774 yet they would 14-1 not hear. 8085-2

28:13 But the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 was unto them precept 6673 upon precept, 6673 precept 6673 upon precept; 6673 line 6957 upon line, 6957 line 6957 upon line; 6957 here a little, 2191 [and] there a little; 2191 that they might go, 3212-4 and fall 3782-1 backward, 268 and be broken, 7665-8 and snared, 3369-8 and taken. 3920-8

28:14 Wherefore hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 ye scornful 3944 men, 582 that rule 4910-6 this people 5971 which [is] in Jerusalem. 3389

28:15 Because ye have said, 559-1 We have made 3772-1 a covenant 1285 with death, 4194 and with hell 7585 are we at 6213-1 agreement; 2374 when the overflowing 7857-6 scourge 7752|7885-k shall pass through, 5674-4|5674-1-k it shall not come 935-4 unto us: for we have made 7760-1 lies 3577 our refuge, 4268 and under falsehood 8267 have we hid 5641-8 ourselves:

28:16 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 Behold, I lay 3245-14 in Zion 6726 for a foundation a stone, 68 a tried 976 stone, 68 a precious 3368 corner 6438 [stone], a sure 3245-94 foundation: 4143 he that believeth 539-56 shall not make haste. 2363-55

28:17 Judgment 4941 also will I lay 7760-1 to the line, 6957 and righteousness 6666 to the plummet: 4949 and the hail 1259 shall sweep away 3261-1 the refuge 4268 of lies, 3577 and the waters 4325 shall overflow 7857-4 the hiding place. 5643

28:18 And your covenant 1285 with death 4194 shall be disannulled, 3722-27 and your agreement 2380 with hell 7585 shall not stand; 6965-4 when the overflowing 7857-6 scourge 7752 shall pass through, 5674-4 then ye shall be trodden down 4823 by it.

28:19 From the time 1767 that it goeth forth 5674-2 it shall take 3947-4 you: for morning 1242 by morning 1242 shall it pass over, 5674-4 by day 3117 and by night: 3915 and it shall be a vexation 2113 only [to] understand 995-53 the report. 8052

28:20 For the bed 4702 is shorter 7114-1 than that [a man] can stretch 8311-99 himself [on it]: and the covering 4541 narrower 6887-1 than that he can wrap 3664-99 himself [in it].

28:21 For the LORD 3068 shall rise up 6965-4 as [in] mount 2022 Perazim, 6559|6556 he shall be wroth 7264-4 as [in] the valley 6010 of Gibeon, 1391 that he may do 6213-2 his work, 4639 his strange 2114-5 work; 4639 and bring to pass 5647-2 his act, 5656 his strange 5237 act. 5656

28:22 Now therefore be ye not mockers, 3887-118 lest your bands 4147 be made strong: 2388-4 for I have heard 8085-1 from the Lord 136 GOD 3069 of hosts 6635 a consumption, 3617 even determined 2782-12 upon the whole earth. 776

28:23 Give ye ear, 238-54 and hear 8085-3 my voice; 6963 hearken, 7181-54 and hear 8085-3 my speech. 565

28:24 Doth the plowman 2790-6 plow 2790-4 all day 3117 to sow? 2232-2 doth he open 6605-17 and break the clods 7702-17 of his ground? 127

28:25 When he hath made plain 7737-14 the face 6440 thereof, doth he not cast abroad 6327-52 the fitches, 7100 and scatter 2236-4 the cummin, 3646 and cast 7760-1 in the principal 7795 wheat 2406 and the appointed 5567-12 barley 8184 and the rie 3698 in their place? 1367

28:26 For his God 430 doth instruct 3256-14 him to discretion, 4941 [and] doth teach 3384-55 him.

28:27 For the fitches 7100 are not threshed 1758-93 with a threshing instrument, 2742 neither is a cart 5699 wheel 212 turned about 5437-93 upon the cummin; 3646 but the fitches 7100 are beaten out 2251-11 with a staff, 4294 and the cummin 3646 with a rod. 7626

28:28 Bread 3899 [corn] is bruised; 1854-93 because he will not ever 5331 be threshing 156-2 1758-4 it, nor break 2000-1 [it with] the wheel 1536 of his cart, 5699 nor bruise 1854-4 it [with] his horsemen. 6571

28:29 This also cometh forth 3318-1 from the LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 [which] is wonderful 6381-52 in counsel, 6098 [and] excellent 1431-52 in working. 8454

29:1 Woe 1945 to Ariel, 740 to Ariel, 740 the city 7151 [where] David 1732 dwelt! 2583-1 add 5595-3 ye year 8141 to year; 8141 let them kill 5362-4 sacrifices. 2282

29:2 Yet I will distress 6693-52 Ariel, 740 and there shall be heaviness 8386 and sorrow: 592 and it shall be unto me as Ariel. 740

29:3 And I will camp 2583-1 against thee round about, 1754 and will lay siege 6696-1 against thee with a mount, 4674 and I will raise 6965-52 forts 4694 against thee.

29:4 And thou shalt be brought down, 8213-1 [and] shalt speak 1696-17 out of the ground, 776 and thy speech 565 shall be low 7817-11 out of the dust, 6083 and thy voice 6963 shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, 178 out of the ground, 776 and thy speech 565 shall whisper 6850-46 out of the dust. 6083

29:5 Moreover the multitude 1995 of thy strangers 2114-5 shall be like small 1851 dust, 80 and the multitude 1995 of the terrible ones 6184 [shall be] as chaff 4671 that passeth away: 5674-6 yea, it shall be at an instant 6621 suddenly. 6597

29:6 Thou shalt be visited 6485-11 of the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 with thunder, 7482 and with earthquake, 7494 and great 1419 noise, 6963 with storm 5492 and tempest, 5591 and the flame 3851 of devouring 398-6 fire. 784

29:7 And the multitude 1995 of all the nations 1471 that fight 6633-6 against Ariel, 740 even all that fight 6638-6 against her and her munition, 4685 and that distress 6693-56 her, shall be as a dream 2472 of a night 3915 vision. 2377

29:8 It shall even be as when 834 an hungry 7457 [man] dreameth, 2492-4 and, behold, he eateth; 398-6 but he awaketh, 6974-52 and his soul 5315 is empty: 7386 or as when a thirsty man 6771 dreameth, 2492-4 and, behold, he drinketh; 8354-6 but he awaketh, 6974-52 and, behold, [he is] faint, 5889 and his soul 5315 hath appetite: 8264-6 so shall the multitude 1995 of all the nations 1471 be, that fight 6633-6 against mount 2022 Zion. 6726

29:9 Stay 4102-117 yourselves, and wonder; 8539-3 cry ye out, 8173-117 and cry: 8173-3 they are drunken, 7937-1 but not with wine; 3196 they stagger, 5128-1 but not with strong drink. 7941

29:10 For the LORD 3068 hath poured out 5258-1 upon you the spirit 7307 of deep sleep, 8639 and hath closed 6105-17 your eyes: 5869 the prophets 5030 and your rulers, 7218 the seers 2374 hath he covered. 3680-14

29:11 And the vision 2380 of all is become unto you as the words 1697 of a book 5612 that is sealed, 2856-7 which [men] deliver 5414-4 to one that is learned, 3045-6 5612 saying, 559-2 Read 7121-3 this, I pray thee: and he saith, 559-1 I cannot; 3808 3201-4 for it [is] sealed: 2856-7

29:12 And the book 5612 is delivered 5414-8 to him that is not learned, 3045-1 5612 saying, 559-2 Read 7121-3 this, I pray thee: and he saith, 559-1 I am not learned. 3045-1 5612

29:13 Wherefore the Lord 136 said, 559-4 Forasmuch as 3282 this people 5971 draw near 5066-8 [me] with their mouth, 6310 and with their lips 8193 do honour 3513-14 me, but have removed their heart 3820 far 7368-14 from me, and their fear 3374 toward me is taught 3925-30 by the precept 4687 of men: 582

29:14 Therefore, behold, I will proceed 3254-6 to do a marvellous work 6381-53 among this people, 5971 [even] a marvellous work 6381-53 and a wonder: 6382 for the wisdom 2451 of their wise 2450 [men] shall perish, 6-1 and the understanding 998 of their prudent 995-12 [men] shall be hid. 5641-101

29:15 Woe 1945 unto them that seek deep 6009-56 to hide 5641-53 their counsel 6098 from the LORD, 3068 and their works 4639 are in the dark, 4285 and they say, 559-4 Who seeth 7200-6 us? and who knoweth 3045-6 us?

29:16 Surely your turning of things upside down 2017-2 shall be esteemed 2803-11 as the potter's 3335-6 clay: 2563 for shall the work 4639 say 559-4 of him that made 6213-6 it, He made 6213-1 me not? or shall the thing framed 3336 say 559-1 of him that framed 3335-6 it, He had no understanding? 995-52

29:17 [Is] it not yet a very 4213 little while, 4592 and Lebanon 3844 shall be turned 7725-1 into a fruitful field, 3760|3759 and the fruitful field 3760|3759 shall be esteemed 2803-11 as a forest? 3293

29:18 And in that day 3117 shall the deaf 2795 hear 8085-1 the words 1697 of the book, 5612 and the eyes 5869 of the blind 5787 shall see 7200-4 out of obscurity, 652 and out of darkness. 2822

29:19 The meek 6035 also shall increase 3254-1 [their] joy 8057 in the LORD, 3068 and the poor 34 among men 120 shall rejoice 1523-4 in the Holy One 6918 of Israel. 3478

29:20 For the terrible one 6184 is brought to nought, 656-1 and the scorner 3887-5 is consumed, 3615-1 and all that watch 8245-6 for iniquity 205 are cut off: 3772-8

29:21 That make a man 120 an offender 2398-56 for a word, 1697 and lay a snare 6983-4 for him that reproveth 3198-56 in the gate, 8179 and turn aside 5186-55 the just 6662 for a thing of nought. 8414

29:22 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 who redeemed 6299-1 Abraham, 85 concerning the house 1004 of Jacob, 3290 Jacob 3290 shall not now be ashamed, 954-4 neither shall his face 6440 now wax pale. 2357-4

29:23 But when he seeth 7200-2 his children, 3206 the work 4639 of mine hands, 3027 in the midst 7130 of him, they shall sanctify 6942-55 my name, 8034 and sanctify 6942-52 the Holy One 6918 of Jacob, 3290 and shall fear 6206-55 the God 430 of Israel. 3478

29:24 They also that erred 8582-6 in spirit 7307 shall come 3045-1 to understanding, 998 and they that murmured 7279-7 shall learn 3925-4 doctrine. 3948

30:1 Woe 1945 to the rebellious 5637-6 children, 1121 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that take 6213-2 counsel, 6098 but not of me; and that cover 5258-2 with a covering, 4541 but not of my spirit, 7307 that they may add 5595-2 sin 2403 to sin: 2403

30:2 That walk 1980-6 to go down 3381-2 into Egypt, 4714 and have not asked 7592-1 at my mouth; 6310 to strengthen 5810-2 themselves in the strength 4581 of Pharaoh, 6547 and to trust 2620-2 in the shadow 6738 of Egypt! 4714

30:3 Therefore shall the strength 4581 of Pharaoh 6547 be your shame, 1322 and the trust 2622 in the shadow 6738 of Egypt 4714 [your] confusion. 3639

30:4 For his princes 8269 were at Zoan, 6814 and his ambassadors 4397 came 5060-55 to Hanes. 2609

30:5 They were all ashamed 3001-52 of a people 5971 [that] could not profit 3276-55 them, nor be an help 5828 nor profit, 3276-53 but a shame, 1322 and also a reproach. 2781

30:6 The burden 4853 of the beasts 929 of the south: 5045 into the land 776 of trouble 6869 and anguish, 6695 from whence [come] the young 3833 and old lion, 3918 the viper 660 and fiery flying 5774-35 serpent, 8314 they will carry 5375-4 their riches 2428 upon the shoulders 3802 of young asses, 5895 and their treasures 214 upon the bunches 1707 of camels, 1581 to a people 5971 [that] shall not profit 3276-55 [them].

30:7 For the Egyptians 4714 shall help 5826-4 in vain, 1892 and to no purpose: 7385 therefore have I cried 7121-1 concerning this, 2063 Their 1992 strength 7293|7294 [is] to sit still. 7674

30:8 Now go, 935-3 write 3789-3 it before them in a table, 3871 and note 2710-3 it in a book, 5612 that it may be for the time 3117 to come 314 for 5704 ever 5703 and ever: 5769

30:9 That this [is] a rebellious 4805 people, 5971 lying 3586 children, 1121 children 1121 [that] will 14-1 not hear 8085-2 the law 8451 of the LORD: 3068

30:10 Which say 559-1 to the seers, 7200-6 See 7200-4 not; and to the prophets, 2374 Prophesy 2372-4 not unto us right things, 5229 speak 1696-16 unto us smooth things, 2513 prophesy 2372-3 deceits: 4123

30:11 Get 5493-3 you out of the way, 1870 turn aside 5186-54 out of the path, 734 cause the Holy One 6918 of Israel 3478 to cease 7673-54 from before 6440 us.

30:12 Wherefore thus saith 559-1 the Holy One 6918 of Israel, 3478 Because ye despise 3988-2 this word, 1697 and trust 982-4 in oppression 6233 and perverseness, 3868-12 and stay 8172-11 thereon:

30:13 Therefore this iniquity 5771 shall be to you as a breach 6556 ready to fall, 5307-6 swelling out 1158-12 in a high 7682-12 wall, 2346 whose breaking 7667 cometh 935-4 suddenly 6597 at an instant. 6621

30:14 And he shall break 7665-1 it as the breaking 7667 of the potters' 3335-6 vessel 5035 that is broken in pieces; 3807-2 he shall not spare: 2550-4 so that there shall not be found 4672-11 in the bursting 4386 of it a sherd 2789 to take 2846-2 fire 784 from the hearth, 3344-7 or to take 2834-2 water 4325 [withal] out of the pit. 1360

30:15 For thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 the Holy One 6918 of Israel; 3478 In returning 7729 and rest 5183 shall ye be saved; 3467-11 in quietness 8252-53 and in confidence 985 shall be your strength: 1369 and ye would 14-1 not.

30:16 But ye said, 559-4 No; for we will flee 5127-4 upon horses; 5483 therefore shall ye flee: 5127-4 and, We will ride 7392-4 upon the swift; 7031 therefore shall they that pursue 7291-6 you be swift. 7043-11

30:17 One 259 thousand 505 [shall flee] at 6440 the rebuke 1606 of one; 259 at 6440 the rebuke 1606 of five 2568 shall ye flee: 5127-4 till ye be left 3498-8 as a beacon 8650 upon the top 7218 of a mountain, 2022 and as an ensign 5251 on an hill. 1389

30:18 And therefore will the LORD 3068 wait, 2442-17 that he may be gracious 2603-2 unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, 7311-4 that he may have mercy 7355-15 upon you: for the LORD 3068 [is] a God 430 of judgment: 4941 blessed 835 [are] all they that wait 2442-6 for him.

30:19 For the people 5971 shall dwell 3427-4 in Zion 6726 at Jerusalem: 3389 thou shalt weep 1058-4 no more: 1058-2 he will be very 2603-2 gracious 2603-4 unto thee at the voice 6963 of thy cry; 2199-2 when he shall hear 8085-2 it, he will answer 6030-1 thee.

30:20 And [though] the Lord 136 give 5414-1 you the bread 3899 of adversity, 6862 and the water 4325 of affliction, 3906 yet shall not thy teachers 3384-56 be removed into a corner 3670-11 any more, but thine eyes 5869 shall see 7200-6 thy teachers: 3384-56

30:21 And thine ears 241 shall hear 8085-4 a word 1697 behind 310 thee, saying, 559-2 This [is] the way, 1870 walk ye 3212-3 in it, when ye turn to the right 541-55 hand, and when ye turn to the left. 8041-55

30:22 Ye shall defile 2930-14 also the covering 6826 of thy graven images 6456 of silver, 3701 and the ornament 642 of thy molten images 4541 of gold: 2091 thou shalt cast them away 2219-4 as a menstruous cloth; 1739 thou shalt say 559-4 unto it, Get thee hence. 3318-3

30:23 Then shall he give 5414-1 the rain 4306 of thy seed, 2233 that thou shalt sow 2232-4 the ground 127 withal; and bread 3899 of the increase 8393 of the earth, 127 and it shall be fat 1879 and plenteous: 8082 in that day 3117 shall thy cattle 4735 feed 7462-4 in large 7337-12 pastures. 3733

30:24 The oxen 504 likewise and the young asses 5895 that ear 5647-6 the ground 127 shall eat 398-4 clean 2548 provender, 1098 which hath been winnowed 2219-6 with the shovel 7371 and with the fan. 4214

30:25 And there shall be upon every high 1364 mountain, 2022 and upon every high 5375-12 hill, 1389 rivers 6388 [and] streams 2988 of waters 4325 in the day 3117 of the great 7227 slaughter, 2027 when the towers 4026 fall. 5307-2

30:26 Moreover the light 216 of the moon 3842 shall be as the light 216 of the sun, 2535 and the light 216 of the sun 2535 shall be sevenfold, 7659 as the light 216 of seven 7651 days, 3117 in the day 3117 that the LORD 3068 bindeth up 2280-2 the breach 7667 of his people, 5971 and healeth 7495-4 the stroke 4273 of their wound. 4347

30:27 Behold, the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 cometh 935-1 from far, 4801 burning 1197-6 [with] his anger, 639 and the burden 4858 [thereof is] heavy: 3514 his lips 8193 are full 4390-1 of indignation, 2195 and his tongue 3956 as a devouring 398-6 fire: 784

30:28 And his breath, 7307 as an overflowing 7857-6 stream, 5158 shall reach to the midst 2673-4 of the neck, 6677 to sift 5130-53 the nations 1471 with the sieve 5299 of vanity: 7723 and [there shall be] a bridle 7448 in the jaws 3895 of the people, 5971 causing [them] to err. 8582-56

30:29 Ye shall have a song, 7892 as in the night 3915 [when] a holy solemnity 2282 is kept; 6942-99 and gladness 8057 of heart, 3824 as when one goeth 1980-6 with a pipe 2485 to come 935-2 into the mountain 2022 of the LORD, 3068 to the mighty One 6697 of Israel. 3478

30:30 And the LORD 3068 shall cause his glorious 1935 voice 6963 to be heard, 8085-52 and shall shew 7200-55 the lighting down 5183 of his arm, 2220 with the indignation 2197 of [his] anger, 639 and [with] the flame 3851 of a devouring 398-6 fire, 784 [with] scattering, 5311 and tempest, 2230 and hailstones. 68 1259

30:31 For through the voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 shall the Assyrian 804 be beaten down, 2865-11 [which] smote 5221-55 with a rod. 7626

30:32 And [in] every place 3605 where the grounded 4145 staff 4294 shall pass, 4569 which the LORD 3068 shall lay 5117-55 upon him, [it] shall be with tabrets 8596 and harps: 3658 and in battles 4421 of shaking 8573 will he fight 3898-8 with it.

30:33 For Tophet 8613 [is] ordained 6186-7 of old; 865 yea, for the king 4428 it is prepared; 3559-90 he hath made [it] deep 6009-52 [and] large: 7337-52 the pile 4071 thereof [is] fire 784 and much 7235-53 wood; 6086 the breath 5397 of the LORD, 3068 like a stream 5158 of brimstone, 1614 doth kindle 1197-6 it.

31:1 Woe 1945 to them that go down 3381-6 to Egypt 4714 for help; 5833 and stay 8172-11 on horses, 5483 and trust 982-4 in chariots, 7393 because [they are] many; 7227 and in horsemen, 6571 because they are very 3966 strong; 6105-1 but they look 8159-1 not unto the Holy One 6918 of Israel, 3478 neither seek 1875-1 the LORD! 3068

31:2 Yet he also [is] wise, 2450 and will bring 935-55 evil, 7451 and will not call back 5493-52 his words: 1697 but will arise 6965-1 against the house 1004 of the evildoers, 7489-56 and against the help 5833 of them that work 6466-6 iniquity. 205

31:3 Now the Egyptians 4714 [are] men, 120 and not God; 410 and their horses 5483 flesh, 1320 and not spirit. 7307 When the LORD 3068 shall stretch out 5186-55 his hand, 3027 both he that helpeth 5826-6 shall fall, 3782-1 and he that is holpen 5826-7 shall fall down, 5307-1 and they all shall fail 3615-4 together. 3162

31:4 For thus hath the LORD 3068 spoken 559-1 unto me, Like as the lion 738 and the young lion 3715 roaring 1897-4 on his prey, 2964 when a multitude 4393 of shepherds 7462-6 is called forth 7121-11 against him, [he] will not be afraid 2865-11 of their voice, 6963 nor abase 6031-4 himself for the noise 1995 of them: so shall the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 come down 3381-4 to fight 6633-2 for mount 2022 Zion, 6726 and for the hill 1389 thereof.

31:5 As birds 6833 flying, 5774-6 so will the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 defend 1598-55 Jerusalem; 3389 defending 1598-2 also he will deliver 5337-52 [it; and] passing over 6452-2 he will preserve 4422-52 it.

31:6 Turn 7725-3 ye unto [him from] whom the children 1121 of Israel 3478 have deeply 6009-52 revolted. 5627

31:7 For in that day 3117 every man 376 shall cast away 3988-4 his idols 457 of silver, 3701 and his idols 457 of gold, 2091 which your own hands 3027 have made 6213-1 unto you [for] a sin. 2399

31:8 Then shall the Assyrian 804 fall 5307-1 with the sword, 2719 not of a mighty man; 376 and the sword, 2719 not of a mean man, 120 shall devour 398-4 him: but he shall flee 5127-1 from 6440 the sword, 2719 and his young men 970 shall be discomfited. 4522

31:9 And he shall pass over 5674-4 to his strong hold 5553 for fear, 4032 and his princes 8269 shall be afraid 2865-1 of the ensign, 5251 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 whose fire 217 [is] in Zion, 6726 and his furnace 8574 in Jerusalem. 3389

32:1 Behold, a king 4428 shall reign 4427-4 in righteousness, 6664 and princes 8269 shall rule 8323-4 in judgment. 4941

32:2 And a man 376 shall be as an hiding place 4224 from the wind, 7307 and a covert 5643 from the tempest; 2230 as rivers 6388 of water 4325 in a dry place, 6724 as the shadow 6738 of a great 3515 rock 5553 in a weary 5889 land. 776

32:3 And the eyes 5869 of them that see 7200-6 shall not be dim, 8159-4 and the ears 241 of them that hear 8085-6 shall hearken. 7181-4

32:4 The heart 3824 also of the rash 4116-12 shall understand 995-4 knowledge, 1847 and the tongue 3956 of the stammerers 5926 shall be ready 4116-17 to speak 1696-15 plainly. 6703

32:5 The vile person 5036 shall be no more called 7121-11 liberal, 5081 nor the churl 3596 said 559-11 [to be] bountiful. 7771

32:6 For the vile person 5036 will speak 1696-17 villany, 5039 and his heart 3820 will work 6213-4 iniquity, 205 to practise 6213-2 hypocrisy, 2612 and to utter 1696-15 error 8442 against the LORD, 3068 to make empty 7324-53 the soul 5315 of the hungry, 7457 and he will cause the drink 4945 of the thirsty 6771 to fail. 2637-55

32:7 The instruments 3627 also of the churl 3596 [are] evil: 7451 he deviseth 3289-1 wicked devices 2154 to destroy 2254-15 the poor 6041|6035-k with lying 8267 words, 561 even when the needy 34 speaketh 1696-15 right. 4941

32:8 But the liberal 5081 deviseth 3289-1 liberal things; 5081 and by liberal things 5081 shall he stand. 6965-4

32:9 Rise up, 6965-3 ye women 802 that are at ease; 7600 hear 8085-3 my voice, 6963 ye careless 982-6 daughters; 1323 give ear 238-54 unto my speech. 565

32:10 Many days 3117 and years 8141 shall ye be troubled, 7264-4 ye careless women: 982-6 for the vintage 1210 shall fail, 3615-1 the gathering 625 shall not come. 935-4

32:11 Tremble, 2729-3 ye women that are at ease; 7600 be troubled, 7264-3 ye careless ones: 982-6 strip 6584-2 you, and make you bare, 6209-3 and gird 2290 [sackcloth] upon [your] loins. 2504

32:12 They shall lament 5594-6 for the teats, 7699 for the pleasant 2531 fields, 7704 for the fruitful 6509-6 vine. 1612

32:13 Upon the land 127 of my people 5971 shall come up 5927-4 thorns 6975 [and] briers; 8068 yea, upon all the houses 1004 of joy 4885 [in] the joyous 5947 city: 7151

32:14 Because the palaces 759 shall be forsaken; 5203-27 the multitude 1995 of the city 5892 shall be left; 5800-27 the forts 6076 and towers 975 shall be for dens 4631 for 5704 ever, 5769 a joy 4885 of wild asses, 6501 a pasture 4829 of flocks; 5739

32:15 Until the spirit 7307 be poured 6168-11 upon us from on high, 4791 and the wilderness 4057 be a fruitful field, 3760|3759 and the fruitful field 3760|3759 be counted 2803-11 for a forest. 3293

32:16 Then judgment 4941 shall dwell 7931-1 in the wilderness, 4057 and righteousness 6666 remain 3427-4 in the fruitful field. 3760|3759

32:17 And the work 4639 of righteousness 6666 shall be peace; 7965 and the effect 5656 of righteousness 6666 quietness 8252-53 and assurance 983 for 5704 ever. 5769

32:18 And my people 5971 shall dwell 3427-1 in a peaceable 7965 habitation, 5116 and in sure 4009 dwellings, 4908 and in quiet 7600 resting places; 4496

32:19 When it shall hail, 1258-1 coming down 3381-2 on the forest; 3293 and the city 5892 shall be low 8213-4 in a low place. 8218

32:20 Blessed 835 [are] ye that sow 2232-6 beside all waters, 4325 that send forth 7971-18 [thither] the feet 7272 of the ox 7794 and the ass. 2543

33:1 Woe 1945 to thee that spoilest, 7703-6 and thou [wast] not spoiled; 7703-7 and dealest treacherously, 898-6 and they dealt not treacherously 898-1 with thee! when thou shalt cease 8552-53 to spoil, 7703-6 thou shalt be spoiled; 7703-93 [and] when thou shalt make an end 5239-53 to deal treacherously, 898-2 they shall deal treacherously 898-4 with thee.

33:2 O LORD, 3068 be gracious 2603-3 unto us; we have waited 6960-14 for thee: be thou their arm 2220 every morning, 1242 our salvation 3444 also in the time 6256 of trouble. 6869

33:3 At the noise 6963 of the tumult 1995 the people 5971 fled; 5074-1 at the lifting up 7427 of thyself the nations 1471 were scattered. 5310-1

33:4 And your spoil 7998 shall be gathered 622-27 [like] the gathering 625 of the caterpiller: 2625 as the running to and fro 4944 of locusts 1357 shall he run 8264-6 upon them.

33:5 The LORD 3068 is exalted; 7682-12 for he dwelleth 7931-6 on high: 4791 he hath filled 4390-14 Zion 6726 with judgment 4941 and righteousness. 6666

33:6 And wisdom 2451 and knowledge 1847 shall be the stability 530 of thy times, 6256 [and] strength 2633 of salvation: 3444 the fear 3374 of the LORD 3068 [is] his treasure. 214

33:7 Behold, their valiant ones 691 shall cry 6817-1 without: 2351 the ambassadors 4397 of peace 7965 shall weep 1058-4 bitterly. 4751

33:8 The highways 4546 lie waste, 8074-8 the wayfaring 5674-6 734 man ceaseth: 7673-1 he hath broken 6565-52 the covenant, 1285 he hath despised 3988-1 the cities, 5892 he regardeth 2803-1 no man. 582

33:9 The earth 776 mourneth 56-1 [and] languisheth: 535-49 Lebanon 3844 is ashamed 2659-52 [and] hewn down: 7060-1 Sharon 8289 is like a wilderness; 6160 and Bashan 1316 and Carmel 3760 shake off 5287-6 [their fruits].

33:10 Now will I rise, 6965-4 saith 559-4 the LORD; 3068 now will I be exalted; 7426-11 now will I lift up 5375-11 myself.

33:11 Ye shall conceive 2029-4 chaff, 2842 ye shall bring forth 3205-4 stubble: 7179 your breath, 7307 [as] fire, 784 shall devour 398-4 you.

33:12 And the people 5971 shall be [as] the burnings 4955 of lime: 7875 [as] thorns 6975 cut up 3683-7 shall they be burned 3341-4 in the fire. 784

33:13 Hear, 8085-3 ye [that are] far off, 7350 what I have done; 6213-1 and, ye [that are] near, 7138 acknowledge 3045-3 my might. 1369

33:14 The sinners 2400 in Zion 6726 are afraid; 6342-1 fearfulness 7461 hath surprised 270-1 the hypocrites. 2611 Who among us shall dwell 1481-4 with the devouring 398-6 fire? 784 who among us shall dwell 1481-4 with everlasting 5769 burnings? 4168

33:15 He that walketh 1980-6 righteously, 6666 and speaketh 1696-6 uprightly; 4339 he that despiseth 3988-6 the gain 1215 of oppressions, 4642 that shaketh 5287-6 his hands 3709 from holding 8551-2 of bribes, 7810 that stoppeth 331-5 his ears 241 from hearing 8085-2 of blood, 1818 and shutteth 6105-6 his eyes 5869 from seeing 7200-2 evil; 7451

33:16 He shall dwell 7931-4 on high: 4791 his place of defence 4869 [shall be] the munitions 4679 of rocks: 5553 bread 3899 shall be given 5414-12 him; his waters 4325 [shall be] sure. 539-12

33:17 Thine eyes 5869 shall see 2372-4 the king 4428 in his beauty: 3308 they shall behold 7200-4 the land 776 that is very far off. 4801

33:18 Thine heart 3820 shall meditate 1897-4 terror. 367 Where [is] the scribe? 5608-6 where [is] the receiver? 8254-6 where [is] he that counted 5608-6 the towers? 4026

33:19 Thou shalt not see 7200-4 a fierce 3267-12 people, 5971 a people 5971 of a deeper 6012 speech 8193 than thou canst perceive; 8085-2 of a stammering 3932-12 tongue, 3956 [that thou canst] not understand. 998

33:20 Look 2372-3 upon Zion, 6726 the city 7151 of our solemnities: 4150 thine eyes 5869 shall see 7200-4 Jerusalem 3389 a quiet 7600 habitation, 5116 a tabernacle 168 [that] shall not be taken down; 6813-4 not one of the stakes 3489 thereof shall ever 5331 be removed, 5265-4 neither shall any of the cords 2256 thereof be broken. 5423-11

33:21 But there the glorious 117 LORD 3068 [will be] unto us a place 4725 of broad 7342 3027 rivers 5104 [and] streams; 2975 wherein shall go 3212-4 no 1077 galley 590 with oars, 7885 neither shall gallant 117 ship 6716 pass 5674-4 thereby.

33:22 For the LORD 3068 [is] our judge, 8199-6 the LORD 3068 [is] our lawgiver, 2710-26 the LORD 3068 [is] our king; 4428 he will save 3467-55 us.

33:23 Thy tacklings 2256 are loosed; 5203-8 they could not well 3653 strengthen 2388-17 their mast, 8650 they could not spread 6566-1 the sail: 5251 then is the prey 5706 of a great 4766 spoil 7998 divided; 2505-27 the lame 6455 take 962-1 the prey. 957

33:24 And the inhabitant 7934 shall not say, 559-4 I am sick: 2470-1 the people 5971 that dwell 3427-6 therein [shall be] forgiven 5375-7 [their] iniquity. 5771

34:1 Come near, 7126-3 ye nations, 1471 to hear; 8085-2 and hearken, 7181-54 ye people: 3816 let the earth 776 hear, 8085-4 and all that is therein; 4393 the world, 8398 and all things that come forth 6631 of it.

34:2 For the indignation 7110 of the LORD 3068 [is] upon all nations, 1471 and [his] fury 2534 upon all their armies: 6635 he hath utterly destroyed 2763-52 them, he hath delivered 5414-1 them to the slaughter. 2874

34:3 Their slain 2491 also shall be cast out, 7993-93 and their stink 889 shall come up 5927-4 out of their carcases, 6297 and the mountains 2022 shall be melted 4549-8 with their blood. 1818

34:4 And all the host 6635 of heaven 8064 shall be dissolved, 4743-8 and the heavens 8064 shall be rolled together 1556-8 as a scroll: 5612 and all their host 6635 shall fall down, 5034-4 as the leaf 5929 falleth off 5034-2 from the vine, 1612 and as a falling 5034-6 [fig] from the fig tree. 8384

34:5 For my sword 2719 shall be bathed 7301-14 in heaven: 8064 behold, it shall come down 3381-4 upon Idumea, 123 and upon the people 5971 of my curse, 2764 to judgment. 4941

34:6 The sword 2719 of the LORD 3068 is filled 4390-1 with blood, 1818 it is made fat 1878-120 with fatness, 2459 [and] with the blood 1818 of lambs 3733 and goats, 6260 with the fat 2459 of the kidneys 3629 of rams: 352 for the LORD 3068 hath a sacrifice 2077 in Bozrah, 1224 and a great 1419 slaughter 2874 in the land 776 of Idumea. 123

34:7 And the unicorns 7214 shall come down 3381-1 with them, and the bullocks 6499 with the bulls; 47 and their land 776 shall be soaked 7301-14 with blood, 1818 and their dust 6083 made fat 1878-29 with fatness. 2459

34:8 For [it is] the day 3117 of the LORD'S 3068 vengeance, 5359 [and] the year 8141 of recompences 7966 for the controversy 7379 of Zion. 6726

34:9 And the streams 5158 thereof shall be turned 2015-8 into pitch, 2203 and the dust 6083 thereof into brimstone, 1614 and the land 776 thereof shall become burning 1197-6 pitch. 2203

34:10 It shall not be quenched 3518-4 night 3915 nor day; 3119 the smoke 6227 thereof shall go up 5927-4 for ever: 5769 from generation 1755 to generation 1755 it shall lie waste; 2717-4 none shall pass 5674-6 through it for ever 5331 and ever. 5331

34:11 But the cormorant 6893 and the bittern 7090 shall possess 3423-1 it; the owl 3244 also and the raven 6158 shall dwell 7931-4 in it: and he shall stretch out 5186-1 upon it the line 6957 of confusion, 8414 and the stones 68 of emptiness. 922

34:12 They shall call 7121-4 the nobles 2715 thereof to the kingdom, 4410 but none [shall be] there, and all her princes 8269 shall be nothing. 657

34:13 And thorns 5518 shall come up 5927-1 in her palaces, 759 nettles 7057 and brambles 2336 in the fortresses 4013 thereof: and it shall be an habitation 5116 of dragons, 8577 [and] a court 2681 for owls. 1323 3284

34:14 The wild beasts of the desert 6728 shall also meet 6298-1 with the wild beasts of the island, 338 and the satyr 8163 shall cry 7121-4 to his fellow; 7453 the screech owl 3917 also shall rest 7280-52 there, and find 4672-1 for herself a place of rest. 4494

34:15 There shall the great owl 7091 make her nest, 7077-14 and lay, 4422-17 and hatch, 1234-1 and gather 1716-1 under her shadow: 6738 there shall the vultures 1772 also be gathered, 6908-8 every one 802 with her mate. 7468

34:16 Seek 1875-3 ye out of the book 5612 of the LORD, 3068 and read: 7121-3 no one 259 of these 2007 shall fail, 5737-8 none 802 shall want 6485-1 her mate: 7468 for my mouth 6310 it hath commanded, 6680-14 and his spirit 7307 it hath gathered 6908-14 them.

34:17 And he hath cast 5307-52 the lot 1486 for them, and his hand 3027 hath divided 2505-14 it unto them by line: 6957 they shall possess 3423-4 it for 5704 ever, 5769 from generation 1755 to generation 1755 shall they dwell 7931-4 therein.

35:1 The wilderness 4057 and the solitary place 6723 shall be glad 7797-4 for them; and the desert 6160 shall rejoice, 1523-4 and blossom 6524-4 as the rose. 2261

35:2 It shall blossom 6524-4 abundantly, 6524-2 and rejoice 1523-4 even with joy 1525 and singing: 7444-15 the glory 3519 of Lebanon 3844 shall be given 5414-8 unto it, the excellency 1926 of Carmel 3760 and Sharon, 8289 they shall see 7200-4 the glory 3519 of the LORD, 3068 [and] the excellency 1926 of our God. 430

35:3 Strengthen 2388-16 ye the weak 7504 hands, 3027 and confirm 553-16 the feeble 3782-6 knees. 1290

35:4 Say 559-3 to them [that are] of a fearful 4116-12 heart, 3820 Be strong, 2388-3 fear 3372-4 not: behold, your God 430 will come 935-4 [with] vengeance, 5359 [even] God 430 [with] a recompence; 1576 he will come 935-4 and save 3467-55 you.

35:5 Then the eyes 5869 of the blind 5787 shall be opened, 6491-11 and the ears 241 of the deaf 2795 shall be unstopped. 6605-11

35:6 Then shall the lame 6455 [man] leap 1801-17 as an hart, 354 and the tongue 3956 of the dumb 483 sing: 7442-4 for in the wilderness 4057 shall waters 4325 break out, 1234-8 and streams 5158 in the desert. 6160

35:7 And the parched ground 8273 shall become a pool, 98 and the thirsty land 6774 springs 4002 of water: 4325 in the habitation 5116 of dragons, 8577 where each lay, 7258 [shall be] grass 2682 with reeds 7070 and rushes. 1573

35:8 And an highway 4547 shall be there, and a way, 1870 and it shall be called 7121-11 The way 1870 of holiness; 6944 the unclean 2931 shall not pass over 5674-4 it; but it [shall be] for those: the wayfaring men, 1980-6 1870 though fools, 191 shall not err 8582-4 [therein].

35:9 No lion 738 shall be there, nor [any] ravenous 6530 beast 2416 shall go up 5927-4 thereon, it shall not be found 4672-11 there; but the redeemed 1350-7 shall walk 1980-1 [there]:

35:10 And the ransomed 6299-7 of the LORD 3068 shall return, 7725-4 and come 935-1 to Zion 6726 with songs 7440 and everlasting 5769 joy 8057 upon their heads: 7218 they shall obtain 5381-55 joy 8342 and gladness, 8057 and sorrow 3015 and sighing 585 shall flee away. 5127-1

36:1 Now it came to pass in the fourteenth 702 6240 year 8141 of king 4428 Hezekiah, 2396 [that] Sennacherib 5576 king 4428 of Assyria 804 came up 5927-1 against all the defenced 1219-7 cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 and took 8610-4 them.

36:2 And the king 4428 of Assyria 804 sent 7971-4 Rabshakeh 7262 from Lachish 3923 to Jerusalem 3389 unto king 4428 Hezekiah 2396 with a great 3515 army. 2426 And he stood 5975-4 by the conduit 8585 of the upper 5945 pool 1295 in the highway 4546 of the fuller's 3526-5 field. 7704

36:3 Then came forth 3318-4 unto him Eliakim, 471 Hilkiah's 2518 son, 1121 which was over the house, 1004 and Shebna 7644 the scribe, 5608-6 and Joah, 3098 Asaph's 623 son, 1121 the recorder. 2142-56

36:4 And Rabshakeh 7262 said 559-4 unto them, Say 559-3 ye now to Hezekiah, 2396 Thus saith 559-1 the great 1419 king, 4428 the king 4428 of Assyria, 804 What confidence 986 [is] this wherein thou trustest? 982-1

36:5 I say, 559-1 [sayest thou], (but [they are but] vain 8193 words) 1697 [I have] counsel 6098 and strength 1369 for war: 4421 now on whom dost thou trust, 982-1 that thou rebellest 4775-1 against me?

36:6 Lo, thou trustest 982-1 in the staff 4938 of this broken 7533-7 reed, 7070 on Egypt; 4714 whereon if a man 376 lean, 5564-11 it will go 935-1 into his hand, 3709 and pierce 5344-1 it: so [is] Pharaoh 6547 king 4428 of Egypt 4714 to all that trust 982-6 in him.

36:7 But if thou say 559-4 to me, We trust 982-1 in the LORD 3068 our God: 430 [is it] not he, whose high places 1116 and whose altars 4196 Hezekiah 2396 hath taken away, 5493-52 and said 559-4 to Judah 3063 and to Jerusalem, 3389 Ye shall worship 7812-101 before 6440 this altar? 4196

36:8 Now therefore give pledges, 6148-100 I pray thee, to my master 113 the king 4428 of Assyria, 804 and I will give 5414-4 thee two thousand 505 horses, 5483 if thou be able 3201-4 on thy part to set 5414-2 riders 7392-6 upon them.

36:9 How then wilt thou turn away 7725-55 the face 6440 of one 259 captain 6346 of the least 6996 of my master's 113 servants, 5650 and put thy trust 982-4 on Egypt 4714 for chariots 7393 and for horsemen? 6571

36:10 And am I now come up 5927-1 without 1107 the LORD 3068 against this land 776 to destroy 7843-53 it? the LORD 3068 said 559-1 unto me, Go up 5927-3 against this land, 776 and destroy 7843-54 it.

36:11 Then said 559-4 Eliakim 471 and Shebna 7644 and Joah 3098 unto Rabshakeh, 7262 Speak, 1696-16 I pray thee, unto thy servants 5650 in the Syrian 762 language; for we understand 8085-6 [it]: and speak 1696-17 not to us in the Jews' language, 3066 in the ears 241 of the people 5971 that [are] on the wall. 2346

36:12 But Rabshakeh 7262 said, 559-4 Hath my master 113 sent 7971-1 me to thy master 113 and to thee to speak 1696-15 these words? 1697 [hath he] not [sent me] to the men 582 that sit 3427-6 upon the wall, 2346 that they may eat 398-2 their own dung, 2716|6675-q and drink 8354-2 their own piss 4325|7272|7890-k with you?

36:13 Then Rabshakeh 7262 stood, 5975-4 and cried 7121-4 with a loud 1419 voice 6963 in the Jews' language, 3066 and said, 559-4 Hear 8085-3 ye the words 1697 of the great 1419 king, 4428 the king 4428 of Assyria. 804

36:14 Thus saith 559-1 the king, 4428 Let not Hezekiah 2396 deceive 5377-55 you: for he shall not be able 3201-4 to deliver 5337-53 you.

36:15 Neither let Hezekiah 2396 make you trust 982-55 in the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2 The LORD 3068 will surely 5337-53 deliver 5337-55 us: this city 5892 shall not be delivered 5414-11 into the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Assyria. 804

36:16 Hearken 8085-4 not to Hezekiah: 2396 for thus saith 559-1 the king 4428 of Assyria, 804 Make 6213-3 [an agreement] with me [by] a present, 1293 and come out 3318-3 to me: and eat 398-3 ye every one 376 of his vine, 1612 and every one 376 of his fig tree, 8384 and drink 8354-3 ye every one 376 the waters 4325 of his own cistern; 953

36:17 Until I come 935-2 and take 3947-1 you away to a land 776 like your own land, 776 a land 776 of corn 1715 and wine, 8492 a land 776 of bread 3899 and vineyards. 3754

36:18 [Beware] lest Hezekiah 2396 persuade 5496-55 you, saying, 559-2 The LORD 3068 will deliver 5337-55 us. Hath any 376 of the gods 430 of the nations 1471 delivered 5337-52 his land 776 out of the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Assyria? 804

36:19 Where [are] the gods 430 of Hamath 2574 and Arphad? 774 where [are] the gods 430 of Sepharvaim? 5617 and have they delivered 5337-52 Samaria 8111 out of my hand? 3027

36:20 Who [are they] among all the gods 430 of these lands, 776 that have delivered 5337-52 their land 776 out of my hand, 3027 that the LORD 3068 should deliver 5337-55 Jerusalem 3389 out of my hand? 3027

36:21 But they held their peace, 2790-55 and answered 6030-1 him not a word: 1697 for the king's 4428 commandment 4687 was, saying, 559-2 Answer 6030-4 him not.

36:22 Then came 935-4 Eliakim, 471 the son 1121 of Hilkiah, 2518 that [was] over the household, 1004 and Shebna 7644 the scribe, 5608-6 and Joah, 3098 the son 1121 of Asaph, 623 the recorder, 2142-56 to Hezekiah 2396 with [their] clothes 899 rent, 7167-7 and told 5046-55 him the words 1697 of Rabshakeh. 7262

37:1 And it came to pass, when king 4428 Hezekiah 2396 heard 8085-2 [it], that he rent 7167-4 his clothes, 899 and covered 3680-101 himself with sackcloth, 8242 and went 935-4 into the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

37:2 And he sent 7971-4 Eliakim, 471 who [was] over the household, 1004 and Shebna 7644 the scribe, 5608-6 and the elders 2205 of the priests 3548 covered 3680-102 with sackcloth, 8242 unto Isaiah 3470 the prophet 5030 the son 1121 of Amoz. 531

37:3 And they said 559-4 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 Hezekiah, 2396 This day 3117 [is] a day 3117 of trouble, 6869 and of rebuke, 8433 and of blasphemy: 5007 for the children 1121 are come 935-1 to the birth, 4866 and [there is] not strength 3581 to bring forth. 3205-2

37:4 It may be the LORD 3068 thy God 430 will hear 8085-4 the words 1697 of Rabshakeh, 7262 whom the king 4428 of Assyria 804 his master 113 hath sent 7971-1 to reproach 2778-15 the living 2416 God, 430 and will reprove 3198-52 the words 1697 which the LORD 3068 thy God 430 hath heard: 8085-1 wherefore lift up 5375-1 [thy] prayer 8605 for the remnant 7611 that is left. 4672-12

37:5 So the servants 5650 of king 4428 Hezekiah 2396 came 935-4 to Isaiah. 3470

37:6 And Isaiah 3470 said 559-4 unto them, Thus shall ye say 559-4 unto your master, 113 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Be not afraid 3372-4 of 6440 the words 1697 that thou hast heard, 8085-1 wherewith the servants 5288 of the king 4428 of Assyria 804 have blasphemed 1442-14 me.

37:7 Behold, I will send 5414-6 a blast 7307 upon him, and he shall hear 8085-1 a rumour, 8052 and return 7725-1 to his own land; 776 and I will cause him to fall 5307-52 by the sword 2719 in his own land. 776

37:8 So Rabshakeh 7262 returned, 7725-4 and found 4672-4 the king 4428 of Assyria 804 warring 3898-12 against Libnah: 3841 for he had heard 8085-1 that he was departed 5265-1 from Lachish. 3923

37:9 And he heard 8085-4 say 559-2 concerning Tirhakah 8640 king 4428 of Ethiopia, 3568 He is come forth 3318-1 to make war 3898-9 with thee. And when he heard 8085-4 [it], he sent 7971-4 messengers 4397 to Hezekiah, 2396 saying, 559-2

37:10 Thus shall ye speak 559-4 to Hezekiah 2396 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 saying, 559-2 Let not thy God, 430 in whom thou trustest, 982-6 deceive 5377-55 thee, saying, 559-2 Jerusalem 3389 shall not be given 5414-11 into the hand 3027 of the king 4428 of Assyria. 804

37:11 Behold, thou hast heard 8085-1 what the kings 4428 of Assyria 804 have done 6213-1 to all lands 776 by destroying them utterly; 2763-53 and shalt thou be delivered? 5337-11

37:12 Have the gods 430 of the nations 1471 delivered 5337-52 them which my fathers 1 have destroyed, 7843-52 [as] Gozan, 1470 and Haran, 2771 and Rezeph, 7530 and the children 1121 of Eden 5729 which [were] in Telassar? 8515

37:13 Where [is] the king 4428 of Hamath, 2574 and the king 4428 of Arphad, 774 and the king 4428 of the city 5892 of Sepharvaim, 5617 Hena, 2012 and Ivah? 5755

37:14 And Hezekiah 2396 received 3947-4 the letter 5612 from the hand 3027 of the messengers, 4397 and read 7121-4 it: and Hezekiah 2396 went up 5927-4 unto the house 1004 of the LORD, 3068 and spread 6566-4 it before 6440 the LORD. 3068

37:15 And Hezekiah 2396 prayed 6419-101 unto the LORD, 3068 saying, 559-2

37:16 O LORD 3068 of hosts, 6635 God 430 of Israel, 3478 that dwellest 3427-6 [between] the cherubims, 3742 thou [art] the God, 430 [even] thou alone, of all the kingdoms 4467 of the earth: 776 thou hast made 6213-1 heaven 8064 and earth. 776

37:17 Incline 5186-54 thine ear, 241 O LORD, 3068 and hear; 8085-3 open 6491-3 thine eyes, 5869 O LORD, 3068 and see: 7200-3 and hear 8085-3 all the words 1697 of Sennacherib, 5576 which hath sent 7971-1 to reproach 2778-15 the living 2416 God. 430

37:18 Of a truth, 551 LORD, 3068 the kings 4428 of Assyria 804 have laid waste 2717-52 all the nations, 776 and their countries, 776

37:19 And have cast 5414-2 their gods 430 into the fire: 784 for they [were] no gods, 430 but the work 4639 of men's 120 hands, 3027 wood 6086 and stone: 68 therefore they have destroyed 6-17 them.

37:20 Now therefore, O LORD 3068 our God, 430 save 3467-54 us from his hand, 3027 that all the kingdoms 4467 of the earth 776 may know 3045-4 that thou [art] the LORD, 3068 [even] thou only.

37:21 Then Isaiah 3470 the son 1121 of Amoz 531 sent 7971-4 unto Hezekiah, 2396 saying, 559-2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 God 430 of Israel, 3478 Whereas thou hast prayed 6419-98 to me against Sennacherib 5576 king 4428 of Assyria: 804

37:22 This [is] the word 1697 which the LORD 3068 hath spoken 1696-14 concerning him; The virgin, 1330 the daughter 1323 of Zion, 6726 hath despised 959-1 thee, [and] laughed thee to scorn; 3932-1 the daughter 1323 of Jerusalem 3389 hath shaken 5128-52 her head 7218 at 310 thee.

37:23 Whom hast thou reproached 2778-14 and blasphemed? 1442-14 and against whom hast thou exalted 7311-52 [thy] voice, 6963 and lifted up 5375-4 thine eyes 5869 on high? 4791 [even] against the Holy One 6918 of Israel. 3478

37:24 By 3027 thy servants 5650 hast thou reproached 2778-14 the Lord, 136 and hast said, 559-4 By the multitude 7230 of my chariots 7393 am I come up 5927-1 to the height 4791 of the mountains, 2022 to the sides 3411 of Lebanon; 3844 and I will cut down 3772-4 the tall 6967 cedars 730 thereof, [and] the choice 4005 fir trees 1265 thereof: and I will enter 935-4 into the height 4791 of his border, 7093 [and] the forest 3293 of his Carmel. 3760|3759

37:25 I have digged, 6979-1 and drunk 8354-1 water; 4325 and with the sole 3709 of my feet 6471 have I dried up 2717-55 all the rivers 2975 of the besieged places. 4693|4692

37:26 Hast thou not heard 8085-1 long ago, 7350 [how] I have done 6213-1 it; [and] of ancient 6924 times, 3117 that I have formed 3335-1 it? now have I brought it to pass, 935-52 that thou shouldest be to lay waste 7582-53 defenced 1219-7 cities 5892 [into] ruinous 5327-12 heaps. 1530

37:27 Therefore their inhabitants 3427-6 [were] of small 7116 power, 3027 they were dismayed 2865-1 and confounded: 954-1 they were [as] the grass 6212 of the field, 7704 and [as] the green 3419 herb, 1877 [as] the grass 2682 on the housetops, 1406 and [as corn] blasted 7709 before 6440 it be grown up. 7054

37:28 But I know 3045-1 thy abode, 3427-2 and thy going out, 3318-2 and thy coming in, 935-2 and thy rage 7264-99 against me.

37:29 Because thy rage 7264-99 against me, and thy tumult, 7600 is come up 5927-1 into mine ears, 241 therefore will I put 7760-1 my hook 2397 in thy nose, 639 and my bridle 4964 in thy lips, 8193 and I will turn thee back 7725-52 by the way 1870 by which thou camest. 935-1

37:30 And this [shall be] a sign 226 unto thee, Ye shall eat 398-2 [this] year 8141 such as groweth of itself; 5599 and the second 8145 year 8141 that which springeth 7823 of the same: and in the third 7992 year 8141 sow 2232-3 ye, and reap, 7114-3 and plant 5193-3 vineyards, 3754 and eat 398-3 the fruit 6529 thereof.

37:31 And the remnant 7604-12 that is escaped 6413 of the house 1004 of Judah 3063 shall again 3254-1 take root 8328 downward, 4295 and bear 6213-1 fruit 6529 upward: 4605

37:32 For out of Jerusalem 3389 shall go forth 3318-4 a remnant, 7611 and they that escape 6413 out of mount 2022 Zion: 6726 the zeal 7068 of the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 shall do 6213-4 this.

37:33 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 concerning the king 4428 of Assyria, 804 He shall not come 935-4 into this city, 5892 nor shoot 3384-55 an arrow 2671 there, nor come before 6923-17 it with shields, 4043 nor cast 8210-4 a bank 5550 against it.

37:34 By the way 1870 that he came, 935-1 by the same shall he return, 7725-4 and shall not come 935-4 into this city, 5892 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

37:35 For I will defend 1598-1 this city 5892 to save 3467-53 it for mine own sake, and for my servant 5650 David's 1732 sake.

37:36 Then the angel 4397 of the LORD 3068 went forth, 3318-4 and smote 5221-55 in the camp 4264 of the Assyrians 804 a hundred 3967 and fourscore 8084 and five 2568 thousand: 505 and when they arose early 7925-55 in the morning, 1242 behold, they [were] all dead 4191-5 corpses. 6297

37:37 So Sennacherib 5576 king 4428 of Assyria 804 departed, 5265-4 and went 3212-4 and returned, 7725-4 and dwelt 3427-4 at Nineveh. 5210

37:38 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping 7812-102 in the house 1004 of Nisroch 5268 his god, 430 that Adrammelech 152 and Sharezer 8272 his sons 1121 smote 5221-52 him with the sword; 2719 and they escaped 4422-8 into the land 776 of Armenia: 780 and Esarhaddon 634 his son 1121 reigned 4427-4 in his stead.

38:1 In those days 3117 was Hezekiah 2396 sick 2470-1 unto death. 4191-2 And Isaiah 3470 the prophet 5030 the son 1121 of Amoz 531 came 935-4 unto him, and said 559-4 unto him, Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Set thine house 1004 in order: 6680-16 for thou shalt die, 4191-5 and not live. 2421-4

38:2 Then Hezekiah 2396 turned 5437-55 his face 6440 toward the wall, 7023 and prayed 6419-101 unto the LORD, 3068

38:3 And said, 559-4 Remember 2142-3 now, O LORD, 3068 I beseech 577 thee, how I have walked 1980-98 before 6440 thee in truth 571 and with a perfect 8003 heart, 3820 and have done 6213-1 [that which is] good 2896 in thy sight. 5869 And Hezekiah 2396 wept 1058-4 sore. 1065 1419

38:4 Then came the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 to Isaiah, 3470 saying, 559-2

38:5 Go, 1980-2 and say 559-1 to Hezekiah, 2396 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 the God 430 of David 1732 thy father, 1 I have heard 8085-1 thy prayer, 8605 I have seen 7200-1 thy tears: 1832 behold, I will add 3254-6 unto thy days 3117 fifteen 2568 6240 years. 8141

38:6 And I will deliver 5337-55 thee and this city 5892 out of the hand 3709 of the king 4428 of Assyria: 804 and I will defend 1598-1 this city. 5892

38:7 And this [shall be] a sign 226 unto thee from the LORD, 3068 that the LORD 3068 will do 6213-4 this thing 1697 that he hath spoken; 1696-14

38:8 Behold, I will bring again 7725-56 the shadow 6738 of the degrees, 4609 which is gone down 3381-1 in the sun 8121 dial 4609 of Ahaz, 271 ten 6235 degrees 4609 backward. 322 So the sun 8121 returned 7725-4 ten 6235 degrees, 4609 by which degrees 4609 it was gone down. 3381-1

38:9 The writing 4385 of Hezekiah 2396 king 4428 of Judah, 3063 when he had been sick, 2470-2 and was recovered 2421-4 of his sickness: 2483

38:10 I said 559-1 in the cutting off 1824 of my days, 3117 I shall go 3212-4 to the gates 8179 of the grave: 7585 I am deprived 6485-27 of the residue 3499 of my years. 8141

38:11 I said, 559-1 I shall not see 7200-4 the LORD, 3050 [even] the LORD, 3050 in the land 776 of the living: 2416 I shall behold 5027-55 man 120 no more with the inhabitants 3427-6 of the world. 2309

38:12 Mine age 1755 is departed, 5265-8 and is removed 1540-8 from me as a shepherd's 7473 tent: 168 I have cut off 7088-14 like a weaver 707-6 my life: 2416 he will cut me off 1214-17 with pining sickness: 1803 from day 3117 [even] to night 3915 wilt thou make an end 7999-55 of me.

38:13 I reckoned 7737-14 till morning, 1242 [that], as a lion, 738 so will he break 7665-17 all my bones: 6106 from day 3117 [even] to night 3915 wilt thou make an end 7999-55 of me.

38:14 Like a crane 5483 [or] a swallow, 5693 so did I chatter: 6850-46 I did mourn 1897-4 as a dove: 3123 mine eyes 5869 fail 1809-1 [with looking] upward: 4791 O LORD, 3068 I am oppressed; 6234 undertake 6148-3 for me.

38:15 What shall I say? 1696-17 he hath both spoken 559-1 unto me, and himself hath done 6213-1 [it]: I shall go softly 1718-101 all my years 8141 in the bitterness 4751 of my soul. 5315

38:16 O Lord, 136 by these [things men] live, 2421-4 and in all these [things is] the life 2416 of my spirit: 7307 so wilt thou recover 2492-55 me, and make me to live. 2421-54

38:17 Behold, for peace 7965 I had great bitterness: 4751 4843-1 but thou hast in love 2836-1 to my soul 5315 [delivered it] from the pit 7845 of corruption: 1097 for thou hast cast 7993-52 all my sins 2399 behind 310 thy back. 1460

38:18 For the grave 7585 cannot praise 3034-55 thee, death 4194 can [not] celebrate 1984-17 thee: they that go down 3381-6 into the pit 953 cannot hope 7663-17 for thy truth. 571

38:19 The living, 2416 the living, 2416 he shall praise 3034-55 thee, as I [do] this day: 3117 the father 1 to the children 1121 shall make known 3045-55 thy truth. 571

38:20 The LORD 3068 [was ready] to save 3467-53 me: therefore we will sing my songs 5058 to the stringed instruments 5059-17 all the days 3117 of our life 2416 in the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

38:21 For Isaiah 3470 had said, 559-4 Let them take 5375-4 a lump 1690 of figs, 8384 and lay [it] for a plaister 4799-4 upon the boil, 7822 and he shall recover. 2421-4

38:22 Hezekiah 2396 also had said, 559-4 What [is] the sign 226 that I shall go up 5927-4 to the house 1004 of the LORD? 3068

39:1 At that time 6256 Merodachbaladan, 4757 the son 1121 of Baladan, 1081 king 4428 of Babylon, 894 sent 7971-1 letters 5612 and a present 4503 to Hezekiah: 2396 for he had heard 8085-4 that he had been sick, 2470-1 and was recovered. 2388-4

39:2 And Hezekiah 2396 was glad 8055-4 of them, and shewed 7200-55 them the house 1004 of his precious things, 5238 the silver, 3701 and the gold, 2091 and the spices, 1314 and the precious 2896 ointment, 8081 and all the house 1004 of his armour, 3627 and all that was found 4672-8 in his treasures: 214 there was nothing 1697 in his house, 1004 nor in all his dominion, 4475 that Hezekiah 2396 shewed 7200-52 them not.

39:3 Then came 935-4 Isaiah 3470 the prophet 5030 unto king 4428 Hezekiah, 2396 and said 559-4 unto him, What said 559-1 these men? 582 and from whence 370 came 935-4 they unto thee? And Hezekiah 2396 said, 559-4 They are come 935-1 from a far 7350 country 776 unto me, [even] from Babylon. 894

39:4 Then said 559-4 he, What have they seen 7200-1 in thine house? 1004 And Hezekiah 2396 answered, 559-4 All that [is] in mine house 1004 have they seen: 7200-1 there is nothing 1697 among my treasures 214 that I have not shewed 7200-52 them.

39:5 Then said 559-4 Isaiah 3470 to Hezekiah, 2396 Hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 of hosts: 6635

39:6 Behold, the days 3117 come, 935-6 that all that [is] in thine house, 1004 and [that] which thy fathers 1 have laid up in store 686-1 until this day, 3117 shall be carried 5375-8 to Babylon: 894 nothing 1697 shall be left, 3498-11 saith 559-1 the LORD. 3068

39:7 And of thy sons 1121 that shall issue 3318-4 from thee, which thou shalt beget, 3205-55 shall they take away; 3947-4 and they shall be eunuchs 5631 in the palace 1964 of the king 4428 of Babylon. 894

39:8 Then said 559-4 Hezekiah 2396 to Isaiah, 3470 Good 2896 [is] the word 1697 of the LORD 3068 which thou hast spoken. 1696-14 He said 559-4 moreover, For there shall be peace 7965 and truth 571 in my days. 3117

40:1 Comfort 5162-16 ye, comfort 5162-16 ye my people, 5971 saith 559-4 your God. 430

40:2 Speak 1696-16 ye comfortably 3820 to Jerusalem, 3389 and cry 7121-3 unto her, that her warfare 6635 is accomplished, 4390-1 that her iniquity 5771 is pardoned: 7521-8 for she hath received 3947-1 of the LORD'S 3068 hand 3027 double 3718 for all her sins. 2403

40:3 The voice 6963 of him that crieth 7121-6 in the wilderness, 4057 Prepare 6437-16 ye the way 1870 of the LORD, 3068 make straight 3474-16 in the desert 6160 a highway 4546 for our God. 430

40:4 Every valley 1516 shall be exalted, 5375-11 and every mountain 2022 and hill 1389 shall be made low: 8213-4 and the crooked 6121 shall be made straight, 4334 and the rough places 7406 plain: 1237

40:5 And the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 shall be revealed, 1540-8 and all flesh 1320 shall see 7200-1 [it] together: 3162 for the mouth 6310 of the LORD 3068 hath spoken 1696-14 [it].

40:6 The voice 6963 said, 559-6 Cry. 7121-3 And he said, 559-1 What shall I cry? 7121-4 All flesh 1320 [is] grass, 2682 and all the goodliness 2617 thereof [is] as the flower 6731 of the field: 7704

40:7 The grass 2682 withereth, 3001-1 the flower 6731 fadeth: 5034-1 because the spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 bloweth 5380-1 upon it: surely 403 the people 5971 [is] grass. 2682

40:8 The grass 2682 withereth, 3001-1 the flower 6731 fadeth: 5034-1 but the word 1697 of our God 430 shall stand 6965-4 for ever. 5769

40:9 O Zion, 6726 that bringest good tidings, 1319-18 get thee up 5927-3 into the high 1364 mountain; 2022 O Jerusalem, 3389 that bringest good tidings, 1319-18 lift up 7311-54 thy voice 6963 with strength; 3581 lift [it] up, 7311-54 be not afraid; 3372-4 say 559-3 unto the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 Behold your God! 430

40:10 Behold, the Lord 136 GOD 3069 will come 935-4 with strong 2389 [hand], and his arm 2220 shall rule 4910-6 for him: behold, his reward 7939 [is] with him, and his work 6468 before 6440 him.

40:11 He shall feed 7462-4 his flock 5739 like a shepherd: 7462-6 he shall gather 6908-17 the lambs 2922 with his arm, 2220 and carry 5375-4 [them] in his bosom, 2436 [and] shall gently lead 5095-17 those that are with young. 5763-6

40:12 Who hath measured 4058-1 the waters 4325 in the hollow of his hand, 8168 and meted 8505-14 out heaven 8064 with the span, 2239 and comprehended 3557-1 the dust 6083 of the earth 776 in a measure, 7991 and weighed 8254-1 the mountains 2022 in scales, 6425 and the hills 1389 in a balance? 3976

40:13 Who hath directed 8505-14 the Spirit 7307 of the LORD, 3068 or [being] his counsellor 376 6098 hath taught 3045-55 him?

40:14 With whom took he counsel, 3289-8 and [who] instructed 995-4 him, and taught 3925-17 him in the path 734 of judgment, 4941 and taught 3925-17 him knowledge, 1847 and shewed 3045-55 to him the way 1870 of understanding? 8394

40:15 Behold, the nations 1471 [are] as a drop 4752 of a bucket, 1805 and are counted 2803-8 as the small dust 7834 of the balance: 3976 behold, he taketh up 5190-4 the isles 339 as a very little thing. 1851

40:16 And Lebanon 3844 [is] not 369 sufficient 1767 to burn, 1197-15 nor 369 the beasts 2416 thereof sufficient 1767 for a burnt offering. 5930

40:17 All nations 1471 before him [are] as nothing; and they are counted 2803-8 to him less than nothing, 657 and vanity. 8414

40:18 To whom then will ye liken 1819-17 God? 410 or what likeness 1823 will ye compare 6186-4 unto him?

40:19 The workman 2796 melteth 5258-1 a graven image, 6459 and the goldsmith 6884-6 spreadeth 7554-17 it over with gold, 2091 and casteth 6884-6 silver 3701 chains. 7577

40:20 He that [is] so impoverished 5533-30 that he hath no oblation 8641 chooseth 977-4 a tree 6086 [that] will not rot; 7537-4 he seeketh 1245-17 unto him a cunning 2450 workman 2796 to prepare 3559-53 a graven image, 6459 [that] shall not be moved. 4131-11

40:21 Have ye not known? 3045-4 have ye not heard? 8085-4 hath it not been told 5046-90 you from the beginning? 7218 have ye not understood 995-52 from the foundations 4146 of the earth? 776

40:22 [It is] he that sitteth 3427-6 upon the circle 2329 of the earth, 776 and the inhabitants 3427-6 thereof [are] as grasshoppers; 2284 that stretcheth out 5186-6 the heavens 8064 as a curtain, 1852 and spreadeth them out 4969-4 as a tent 168 to dwell in: 3427-2

40:23 That bringeth 5414-6 the princes 7336-6 to nothing; he maketh 6213-1 the judges 8199-6 of the earth 776 as vanity. 8414

40:24 Yea, they shall not be planted; 5193-8 yea, they shall not be sown: 2232-27 yea, their stock 1503 shall not take root 8327-22 in the earth: 776 and he shall also blow 5398-1 upon them, and they shall wither, 3001-4 and the whirlwind 5591 shall take them away 5375-4 as stubble. 7179

40:25 To whom then will ye liken 1819-17 me, or shall I be equal? 7737-4 saith 559-4 the Holy One. 6918

40:26 Lift up 5375-3 your eyes 5869 on high, 4791 and behold 7200-3 who hath created 1254-1 these [things], that bringeth out 3318-56 their host 6635 by number: 4557 he calleth 7121-4 them all by names 8034 by the greatness 7230 of his might, 202 for that [he is] strong 533 in power; 3581 not one 376 faileth. 5737-8

40:27 Why sayest 559-4 thou, O Jacob, 3290 and speakest, 1696-17 O Israel, 3478 My way 1870 is hid 5641-8 from the LORD, 3068 and my judgment 4941 is passed over 5674-4 from my God? 430

40:28 Hast thou not known? 3045-1 hast thou not heard, 8085-1 [that] the everlasting 5769 God, 430 the LORD, 3068 the Creator 1254-6 of the ends 7098 of the earth, 776 fainteth 3286-4 not, neither is weary? 3021-4 [there is] no searching 2714 of his understanding. 8394

40:29 He giveth 5414-6 power 3581 to the faint; 3287 and to [them that have] no might 202 he increaseth 7235-55 strength. 6109

40:30 Even the youths 5288 shall faint 3286-4 and be weary, 3021-4 and the young men 970 shall utterly 3782-2 fall: 3782-11

40:31 But they that wait 6960-6 upon the LORD 3068 shall renew 2498-55 [their] strength; 3581 they shall mount up 5927-4 with wings 83 as eagles; 5404 they shall run, 7323-4 and not be weary; 3021-4 [and] they shall walk, 3212-4 and not faint. 3286-4

41:1 Keep silence 2790-54 before me, O islands; 339 and let the people 3816 renew 2498-55 [their] strength: 3581 let them come near; 5066-4 then let them speak: 1696-17 let us come near 7126-4 together 3162 to judgment. 4941

41:2 Who raised up 5782-52 the righteous 6664 [man] from the east, 4217 called 7121-4 him to his foot, 7272 gave 5414-4 the nations 1471 before 6440 him, and made [him] rule 7287-55 over kings? 4428 he gave 5414-4 [them] as the dust 6083 to his sword, 2719 [and] as driven 5086-12 stubble 7179 to his bow. 7198

41:3 He pursued 7291-4 them, [and] passed 5674-4 safely; 7965 [even] by the way 734 [that] he had not gone 935-4 with his feet. 7272

41:4 Who hath wrought 6466-1 and done 6213-1 [it], calling 7121-6 the generations 1755 from the beginning? 7218 I the LORD, 3068 the first, 7223 and with the last; 314 I [am] he.

41:5 The isles 339 saw 7200-1 [it], and feared; 3372-4 the ends 7098 of the earth 776 were afraid, 2729-4 drew near, 7126-1 and came. 857-4

41:6 They helped 5826-4 every one 376 his neighbour; 7453 and [every one] said 559-4 to his brother, 251 Be of good courage. 2388-3

41:7 So the carpenter 2796 encouraged 2388-17 the goldsmith, 6884-6 [and] he that smootheth 2505-56 [with] the hammer 6360 him that smote 1986-6 the anvil, 6471 saying, 559-6 It [is] ready 2896 for the sodering: 1694 and he fastened 2388-17 it with nails, 4548 [that] it should not be moved. 4131-11

41:8 But thou, Israel, 3478 [art] my servant, 5650 Jacob 3290 whom I have chosen, 977-1 the seed 2233 of Abraham 85 my friend. 157-6

41:9 [Thou] whom I have taken 2388-52 from the ends 7098 of the earth, 776 and called 7121-1 thee from the chief men 678 thereof, and said 559-4 unto thee, Thou [art] my servant; 5650 I have chosen 977-1 thee, and not cast thee away. 3988-1

41:10 Fear 3372-4 thou not; for I [am] with thee: be not dismayed; 8159-101 for I [am] thy God: 430 I will strengthen 553-14 thee; yea, I will help 5826-1 thee; yea, I will uphold 8551-1 thee with the right hand 3225 of my righteousness. 6664

41:11 Behold, all they that were incensed 2734-12 against thee shall be ashamed 954-4 and confounded: 3637-11 they shall be as nothing; and they 582 that strive 7379 with thee shall perish. 6-4

41:12 Thou shalt seek 1245-17 them, and shalt not find 4672-4 them, [even] them 582 that contended 4695 with thee: they 582 that war 4421 against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought. 657

41:13 For I the LORD 3068 thy God 430 will hold 2388-56 thy right hand, 3225 saying 559-6 unto thee, Fear 3372-4 not; I will help 5826-1 thee.

41:14 Fear 3372-4 not, thou worm 8438 Jacob, 3290 [and] ye men 4962 of Israel; 3478 I will help 5826-1 thee, saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 and thy redeemer, 1350-6 the Holy One 6918 of Israel. 3478

41:15 Behold, I will make 7760-1 thee a new 2319 sharp 2742 threshing instrument 4173 having 1167 teeth: 6374 thou shalt thresh 1758-4 the mountains, 2022 and beat [them] small, 1854-4 and shalt make 7760-4 the hills 1389 as chaff. 4671

41:16 Thou shalt fan 2219-4 them, and the wind 7307 shall carry them away, 5375-4 and the whirlwind 5591 shall scatter 6327-55 them: and thou shalt rejoice 1523-4 in the LORD, 3068 [and] shalt glory 1984-101 in the Holy One 6918 of Israel. 3478

41:17 [When] the poor 6041 and needy 34 seek 1245-18 water, 4325 and [there is] none, [and] their tongue 3956 faileth 5405-1 for thirst, 6772 I the LORD 3068 will hear 6030-4 them, I the God 430 of Israel 3478 will not forsake 5800-4 them.

41:18 I will open 6605-4 rivers 5104 in high places, 8205 and fountains 4599 in the midst 8432 of the valleys: 1237 I will make 7760-4 the wilderness 4057 a pool 98 of water, 4325 and the dry 6723 land 776 springs 4161 of water. 4325

41:19 I will plant 5414-4 in the wilderness 4057 the cedar, 730 the shittah tree, 7848 and the myrtle, 1918 and the oil 8081 tree; 6086 I will set 7760-4 in the desert 6160 the fir tree, 1265 [and] the pine, 8410 and the box tree 8391 together: 3162

41:20 That they may see, 7200-4 and know, 3045-4 and consider, 7760-4 and understand 7919-55 together, 3162 that the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 hath done 6213-1 this, and the Holy One 6918 of Israel 3478 hath created 1254-1 it.

41:21 Produce 7126-16 your cause, 7379 saith 559-4 the LORD; 3068 bring forth 5066-54 your strong 6110 [reasons], saith 559-4 the King 4428 of Jacob. 3290

41:22 Let them bring [them] forth, 5066-55 and shew 5046-55 us what shall happen: 7136-4 let them shew 5046-54 the former things, 7223 what they [be], that we may consider 7760-4 3820 them, and know 3045-4 the latter end of them; 319 or declare 8085-54 us things for to come. 935-6

41:23 Shew 5046-54 the things that are to come 857-6 hereafter, 268 that we may know 3045-4 that ye [are] gods: 430 yea, do good, 3190-55 or do evil, 7489-55 that we may be dismayed, 8159-101 and behold 7200-4 [it] together. 3162

41:24 Behold, ye [are] of nothing, 369 and your work 6467 of nought: 659 an abomination 8441 [is he that] chooseth 977-4 you.

41:25 I have raised up 5782-52 [one] from the north, 6828 and he shall come: 857-4 from the rising 4217 of the sun 8121 shall he call 7121-4 upon my name: 8034 and he shall come 935-4 upon princes 5461 as [upon] morter, 2563 and as the potter 3335-6 treadeth 7429-4 clay. 2916

41:26 Who hath declared 5046-52 from the beginning, 7218 that we may know? 3045-4 and beforetime, 6440 that we may say, 559-4 [He is] righteous? 6662 yea, [there is] none that sheweth, 5046-56 yea, [there is] none that declareth, 8085-56 yea, [there is] none that heareth 8085-6 your words. 561

41:27 The first 7223 [shall say] to Zion, 6726 Behold, 2009 behold 2009 them: and I will give 5414-4 to Jerusalem 3389 one that bringeth good tidings. 1319-18

41:28 For I beheld, 7200-4 and [there was] no man; 376 even among them, and [there was] no counsellor, 3289-6 that, when I asked 7592-4 of them, could answer 7725-55 a word. 1697

41:29 Behold, they [are] all vanity; 205 their works 4639 [are] nothing: 657 their molten images 5262 [are] wind 7307 and confusion. 8414

42:1 Behold my servant, 5650 whom I uphold; 8551-4 mine elect, 972 [in whom] my soul 5315 delighteth; 7521-1 I have put 5414-1 my spirit 7307 upon him: he shall bring forth 3318-55 judgment 4941 to the Gentiles. 1471

42:2 He shall not cry, 6817-4 nor lift up, 5375-4 nor cause his voice 6963 to be heard 8085-55 in the street. 2351

42:3 A bruised 7533-7 reed 7070 shall he not break, 7665-4 and the smoking 3544 flax 6594 shall he not quench: 3518-17 he shall bring forth 3318-55 judgment 4941 unto truth. 571

42:4 He shall not fail 3543-4 nor be discouraged, 7533-4 till he have set 7760-4 judgment 4941 in the earth: 776 and the isles 339 shall wait 3176-17 for his law. 8451

42:5 Thus saith 559-1 God 410 the LORD, 3068 he that created 1254-6 the heavens, 8064 and stretched them out; 5186-6 he that spread forth 7554-6 the earth, 776 and that which cometh out 6631 of it; he that giveth 5414-6 breath 5397 unto the people 5971 upon it, and spirit 7307 to them that walk 1980-6 therein:

42:6 I the LORD 3068 have called 7121-1 thee in righteousness, 6664 and will hold 2388-55 thine hand, 3027 and will keep 5341-4 thee, and give 5414-4 thee for a covenant 1285 of the people, 5971 for a light 216 of the Gentiles; 1471

42:7 To open 6491-2 the blind 5787 eyes, 5869 to bring out 3318-53 the prisoners 616 from the prison, 4525 [and] them that sit 3427-6 in darkness 2822 out of the prison 3608 house. 1004

42:8 I [am] the LORD: 3068 that [is] my name: 8034 and my glory 3519 will I not give 5414-4 to another, 312 neither my praise 8416 to graven images. 6456

42:9 Behold, the former things 7223 are come to pass, 935-1 and new things 2319 do I declare: 5046-56 before they spring forth 6779-4 I tell 8085-55 you of them.

42:10 Sing 7891-3 unto the LORD 3068 a new 2319 song, 7892 [and] his praise 8416 from the end 7097 of the earth, 776 ye that go down 3381-6 to the sea, 3220 and all that is therein; 4393 the isles, 339 and the inhabitants 3427-6 thereof.

42:11 Let the wilderness 4057 and the cities 5892 thereof lift up 5375-4 [their voice], the villages 2691 [that] Kedar 6938 doth inhabit: 3427-4 let the inhabitants 3427-6 of the rock 5553 sing, 7442-4 let them shout 6681-4 from the top 7218 of the mountains. 2022

42:12 Let them give 7760-4 glory 3519 unto the LORD, 3068 and declare 5046-55 his praise 8416 in the islands. 339

42:13 The LORD 3068 shall go forth 3318-4 as a mighty man, 1368 he shall stir up 5782-55 jealousy 7068 like a man 376 of war: 4421 he shall cry, 7321-55 yea, roar; 6873-55 he shall prevail 1396-101 against his enemies. 341-6

42:14 I have long time 5769 holden my peace; 2814-52 I have been still, 2790-55 [and] refrained 662-101 myself: [now] will I cry 6463-4 like a travailing woman; 3205-6 I will destroy 5395-4|8074-4-q and devour 7602-4 at once. 3162

42:15 I will make waste 2717-55 mountains 2022 and hills, 1389 and dry up 3001-55 all their herbs; 6212 and I will make 7760-1 the rivers 5104 islands, 339 and I will dry up 3001-55 the pools. 98

42:16 And I will bring 3212-52 the blind 5787 by a way 1870 [that] they knew 3045-1 not; I will lead 1869-55 them in paths 5410 [that] they have not known: 3045-1 I will make 7760-4 darkness 4285 light 216 before 6440 them, and crooked things 4625 straight. 4334 These things 1697 will I do 6213-1 unto them, and not forsake 5800-1 them.

42:17 They shall be turned 5472-8 back, 268 they shall be greatly 1322 ashamed, 954-4 that trust 982-6 in graven images, 6459 that say 559-6 to the molten images, 4541 Ye [are] our gods. 430

42:18 Hear, 8085-3 ye deaf; 2795 and look, 5027-54 ye blind, 5787 that ye may see. 7200-2

42:19 Who [is] blind, 5787 but my servant? 5650 or deaf, 2795 as my messenger 4397 [that] I sent? 7971-4 who [is] blind 5787 as [he that is] perfect, 7999-30 and blind 5787 as the LORD'S 3068 servant? 5650

42:20 Seeing 7200-2|7200-1-k many things, 7227 but thou observest 8104-4 not; opening 6491-2 the ears, 241 but he heareth 8085-4 not.

42:21 The LORD 3068 is well pleased 2654-1 for his righteousness' 6664 sake; he will magnify 1431-55 the law, 8451 and make [it] honourable. 142-55

42:22 But this [is] a people 5971 robbed 962-7 and spoiled; 8154-7 [they are] all of them snared 6351-53 in holes, 2352|970-q and they are hid 2244-90 in prison 3608 houses: 1004 they are for a prey, 957 and none delivereth; 5337-56 for a spoil, 4933 and none saith, 559-6 Restore. 7725-54

42:23 Who among you will give ear 238-55 to this? [who] will hearken 7181-55 and hear 8085-4 for the time to come? 268

42:24 Who gave 5414-1 Jacob 3290 for a spoil, 4933|4882-k and Israel 3478 to the robbers? 962-6 did not the LORD, 3068 he against whom 2098 we have sinned? 2398-1 for they would 14-1 not walk 1980-2 in his ways, 1870 neither were they obedient 8085-1 unto his law. 8451

42:25 Therefore he hath poured 8210-4 upon him the fury 2534 of his anger, 639 and the strength 5807 of battle: 4421 and it hath set him on fire 3857-17 round about, 5439 yet he knew 3045-1 not; and it burned 1197-4 him, yet he laid 7760-4 [it] not to heart. 3820

43:1 But now thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 that created 1254-6 thee, O Jacob, 3290 and he that formed 3335-6 thee, O Israel, 3478 Fear 3372-4 not: for I have redeemed 1350-1 thee, I have called 7121-1 [thee] by thy name; 8034 thou [art] mine.

43:2 When thou passest through 5674-4 the waters, 4325 I [will be] with thee; and through the rivers, 5104 they shall not overflow 7857-4 thee: when thou walkest 3212-4 through 1119 the fire, 784 thou shalt not be burned; 3554-11 neither shall the flame 3852 kindle 1197-4 upon thee.

43:3 For I [am] the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 the Holy One 6918 of Israel, 3478 thy Saviour: 3467-56 I gave 5414-1 Egypt 4714 [for] thy ransom, 3724 Ethiopia 3568 and Seba 5434 for thee.

43:4 Since thou wast precious 3365-1 in my sight, 5869 thou hast been honourable, 3513-8 and I have loved 157-1 thee: therefore will I give 5414-4 men 120 for thee, and people 3816 for thy life. 5315

43:5 Fear 3372-4 not: for I [am] with thee: I will bring 935-55 thy seed 2233 from the east, 4217 and gather 6908-17 thee from the west; 4628

43:6 I will say 559-4 to the north, 6828 Give up; 5414-3 and to the south, 8486 Keep not back: 3607-4 bring 935-54 my sons 1121 from far, 7350 and my daughters 1323 from the ends 7097 of the earth; 776

43:7 [Even] every one 3605 that is called 7121-12 by my name: 8034 for I have created 1254-1 him for my glory, 3519 I have formed 3335-1 him; yea, I have made 6213-1 him.

43:8 Bring forth 3318-54 the blind 5787 people 5971 that have 3426 eyes, 5869 and the deaf 2795 that have ears. 241

43:9 Let all the nations 1471 be gathered 6908-8 together, 3162 and let the people 3816 be assembled: 622-11 who among them can declare 5046-55 this, and shew 8085-55 us former things? 7223 let them bring forth 5414-4 their witnesses, 5707 that they may be justified: 6663-4 or let them hear, 8085-4 and say, 559-4 [It is] truth. 571

43:10 Ye [are] my witnesses, 5707 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 and my servant 5650 whom I have chosen: 977-1 that ye may know 3045-4 and believe 539-55 me, and understand 995-4 that I [am] he: before 6440 me there was no God 410 formed, 3335-8 neither shall there be after 310 me.

43:11 I, [even] I, [am] the LORD; 3068 and beside 1107 me [there is] no saviour. 3467-56

43:12 I have declared, 5046-52 and have saved, 3467-52 and I have shewed, 8085-52 when [there was] no strange 2114-5 [god] among you: therefore ye [are] my witnesses, 5707 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that I [am] God. 410

43:13 Yea, before the day 3117 [was] I [am] he; and [there is] none that can deliver 5337-56 out of my hand: 3027 I will work, 6466-4 and who shall let 7725-55 it?

43:14 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 your redeemer, 1350-6 the Holy One 6918 of Israel; 3478 For your sake I have sent 7971-14 to Babylon, 894 and have brought down 3381-52 all their nobles, 1281 and the Chaldeans, 3778 whose cry 7440 [is] in the ships. 591

43:15 I [am] the LORD, 3068 your Holy One, 6918 the creator 1254-6 of Israel, 3478 your King. 4428

43:16 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 which maketh 5414-6 a way 1870 in the sea, 3220 and a path 5410 in the mighty 5794 waters; 4325

43:17 Which bringeth forth 3318-56 the chariot 7393 and horse, 5483 the army 2428 and the power; 5808 they shall lie down 7901-4 together, 3162 they shall not rise: 6965-4 they are extinct, 1846-1 they are quenched 3518-1 as tow. 6594

43:18 Remember 2142-4 ye not the former things, 7223 neither consider 995-113 the things of old. 6931

43:19 Behold, I will do 6213-6 a new thing; 2319 now it shall spring forth; 6779-4 shall ye not know 3045-4 it? I will even make 7760-4 a way 1870 in the wilderness, 4057 [and] rivers 5104 in the desert. 3452

43:20 The beast 2416 of the field 7704 shall honour 3513-17 me, the dragons 8577 and the owls: 1323 3284 because I give 5414-1 waters 4325 in the wilderness, 4057 [and] rivers 5104 in the desert, 3452 to give drink 8248-53 to my people, 5971 my chosen. 972

43:21 This 2098 people 5971 have I formed 3335-1 for myself; they shall shew forth 5608-17 my praise. 8416

43:22 But thou hast not called 7121-1 upon me, O Jacob; 3290 but thou hast been weary 3021-1 of me, O Israel. 3478

43:23 Thou hast not brought 935-52 me the small cattle 7716 of thy burnt offerings; 5930 neither hast thou honoured 3513-14 me with thy sacrifices. 2077 I have not caused thee to serve 5647-52 with an offering, 4503 nor wearied 3021-52 thee with incense. 3828

43:24 Thou hast bought 7069-1 me no sweet cane 7070 with money, 3701 neither hast thou filled 7301-52 me with the fat 2459 of thy sacrifices: 2077 but thou hast made me to serve 5647-52 with thy sins, 2403 thou hast wearied 3021-52 me with thine iniquities. 5771

43:25 I, [even] I, [am] he that blotteth out 4229-6 thy transgressions 6588 for mine own sake, and will not remember 2142-4 thy sins. 2403

43:26 Put me in remembrance: 2142-54 let us plead 8199-11 together: 3162 declare 5608-16 thou, that thou mayest be justified. 6663-4

43:27 Thy first 7223 father 1 hath sinned, 2398-1 and thy teachers 3887-56 have transgressed 6586-1 against me.

43:28 Therefore I have profaned 2490-17 the princes 8269 of the sanctuary, 6944 and have given 5414-4 Jacob 3290 to the curse, 2764 and Israel 3478 to reproaches. 1421

44:1 Yet now hear, 8085-3 O Jacob 3290 my servant; 5650 and Israel, 3478 whom I have chosen: 977-1

44:2 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 that made 6213-6 thee, and formed 3335-6 thee from the womb, 990 [which] will help 5826-4 thee; Fear 3372-4 not, O Jacob, 3290 my servant; 5650 and thou, Jesurun, 3484 whom I have chosen. 977-1

44:3 For I will pour 3332-4 water 4325 upon him that is thirsty, 6771 and floods 5140-6 upon the dry ground: 3004 I will pour 3332-4 my spirit 7307 upon thy seed, 2233 and my blessing 1293 upon thine offspring: 6631

44:4 And they shall spring up 6779-1 [as] among 996 the grass, 2682 as willows 6155 by the water 4325 courses. 2988

44:5 One shall say, 559-4 I [am] the LORD'S; 3068 and another shall call 7121-4 [himself] by the name 8034 of Jacob; 3290 and another shall subscribe 3789-4 [with] his hand 3027 unto the LORD, 3068 and surname 3655-17 [himself] by the name 8034 of Israel. 3478

44:6 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 the King 4428 of Israel, 3478 and his redeemer 1350-6 the LORD 3068 of hosts; 6635 I [am] the first, 7223 and I [am] the last; 314 and beside 1107 me [there is] no God. 430

44:7 And who, as I, shall call, 7121-4 and shall declare 5046-55 it, and set it in order 6186-4 for me, since I appointed 7760-2 the ancient 5769 people? 5971 and the things that are coming, 857-6 and shall come, 935-4 let them shew 5046-55 unto them.

44:8 Fear 6342-4 ye not, neither be afraid: 7297-4|7297-1 have not I told 8085-52 thee from that time, 227 and have declared 5046-52 [it]? ye [are] even my witnesses. 5707 Is there 3426 a God 433 beside 1107 me? yea, [there is] no God; 6697 I know 3045-1 not [any].

44:9 They that make 3335-6 a graven image 6459 [are] all of them vanity; 8414 and their delectable things 2530-7 shall not profit; 3276-55 and they [are] their own witnesses; 5707 they see 7200-4 not, nor know; 3045-4 that they may be ashamed. 954-4

44:10 Who hath formed 3335-1 a god, 410 or molten 5258-1 a graven image 6459 [that] is profitable 3276-53 for nothing? 1115

44:11 Behold, all his fellows 2270 shall be ashamed: 954-4 and the workmen, 2796 they [are] of men: 120 let them all be gathered together, 6908-101 let them stand up; 5975-4 [yet] they shall fear, 6342-4 [and] they shall be ashamed 954-4 together. 3162

44:12 The smith 1270 2796 with the tongs 4621 both worketh 6466-1 in the coals, 6352 and fashioneth 3335-4 it with hammers, 4717 and worketh 6466-4 it with the strength 3581 of his arms: 2220 yea, he is hungry, 7457 and his strength 3581 faileth: 369 he drinketh 8354-1 no water, 4325 and is faint. 3286-4

44:13 The carpenter 2796 6086 stretcheth out 5186-1 [his] rule; 6957 he marketh it out 8388-17 with a line; 8279 he fitteth 6213-4 it with planes, 4741 and he marketh it out 8388-17 with the compass, 4230 and maketh 6213-4 it after the figure 8403 of a man, 376 according to the beauty 8597 of a man; 120 that it may remain 3427-2 in the house. 1004

44:14 He heweth him down 3772-2 cedars, 730 and taketh 3947-4 the cypress 8645 and the oak, 437 which he strengtheneth 553-17 for himself among the trees 6086 of the forest: 3293 he planteth 5193-1 an ash, 766 and the rain 1653 doth nourish 1431-17 [it].

44:15 Then shall it be for a man 120 to burn: 1197-15 for he will take 3947-4 thereof, and warm 2552-4 himself; yea, he kindleth 5400-55 [it], and baketh 644-1 bread; 3899 yea, he maketh 6466-4 a god, 410 and worshippeth 7812-101 [it]; he maketh 6213-1 it a graven image, 6459 and falleth down 5456-4 thereto.

44:16 He burneth 8313-1 part 2677 thereof in 1119 the fire; 784 with part 2677 thereof he eateth 398-4 flesh; 1320 he roasteth 6740-4 roast, 6748 and is satisfied: 7646-4 yea, he warmeth 2552-4 [himself], and saith, 559-4 Aha, 1889 I am warm, 2552-1 I have seen 7200-1 the fire: 217

44:17 And the residue 7611 thereof he maketh 6213-1 a god, 410 [even] his graven image: 6459 he falleth down 5456-4 unto it, and worshippeth 7812-101 [it], and prayeth 6419-101 unto it, and saith, 559-4 Deliver 5337-54 me; for thou [art] my god. 410

44:18 They have not known 3045-1 nor understood: 995-4 for he hath shut 2902-1 their eyes, 5869 that they cannot see; 7200-2 [and] their hearts, 3826 that they cannot understand. 7919-53

44:19 And none considereth 7725-55 in his heart, 3820 neither [is there] knowledge 1847 nor understanding 8394 to say, 559-2 I have burned 8313-1 part 2677 of it in 1119 the fire; 784 yea, also I have baked 644-1 bread 3899 upon the coals 1513 thereof; I have roasted 6740-4 flesh, 1320 and eaten 398-4 [it]: and shall I make 6213-4 the residue 3499 thereof an abomination? 8441 shall I fall down 5456-4 to the stock of 944 a tree? 6086

44:20 He feedeth 7462-6 on ashes: 665 a deceived 2048-27 heart 3820 hath turned him aside, 5186-52 that he cannot deliver 5337-55 his soul, 5315 nor say, 559-4 [Is there] not a lie 8267 in my right hand? 3225

44:21 Remember 2142-3 these, O Jacob 3290 and Israel; 3478 for thou [art] my servant: 5650 I have formed 3335-1 thee; thou [art] my servant: 5650 O Israel, 3478 thou shalt not be forgotten 5382-11 of me.

44:22 I have blotted out, 4229-1 as a thick cloud, 5645 thy transgressions, 6588 and, as a cloud, 6051 thy sins: 2403 return 7725-3 unto me; for I have redeemed 1350-1 thee.

44:23 Sing, 7442-3 O ye heavens; 8064 for the LORD 3068 hath done 6213-1 [it]: shout, 7321-54 ye lower parts 8482 of the earth: 776 break forth 6476-3 into singing, 7440 ye mountains, 2022 O forest, 3293 and every tree 6086 therein: for the LORD 3068 hath redeemed 1350-1 Jacob, 3290 and glorified 6286-101 himself in Israel. 3478

44:24 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 thy redeemer, 1350-6 and he that formed 3335-6 thee from the womb, 990 I [am] the LORD 3068 that maketh 6213-6 all [things]; that stretcheth forth 5186-6 the heavens 8064 alone; that spreadeth abroad 7554-6 the earth 776 by myself;

44:25 That frustrateth 6565-56 the tokens 226 of the liars, 907 and maketh diviners 7080-6 mad; 1984-25 that turneth 7725-56 wise 2450 [men] backward, 268 and maketh their knowledge 1847 foolish; 5528-17

44:26 That confirmeth 6965-56 the word 1697 of his servant, 5650 and performeth 7999-55 the counsel 6098 of his messengers; 4397 that saith 559-6 to Jerusalem, 3389 Thou shalt be inhabited; 3427-93 and to the cities 5892 of Judah, 3063 Ye shall be built, 1129-11 and I will raise up 6965-34 the decayed places 2723 thereof:

44:27 That saith 559-6 to the deep, 6683 Be dry, 2717-3 and I will dry up 3001-55 thy rivers: 5104

44:28 That saith 559-6 of Cyrus, 3566 [He is] my shepherd, 7462-6 and shall perform 7999-55 all my pleasure: 2656 even saying 559-2 to Jerusalem, 3389 Thou shalt be built; 1129-11 and to the temple, 1964 Thy foundation shall be laid. 3245-11

45:1 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 to his anointed, 4899 to Cyrus, 3566 whose right hand 3225 I have holden, 2388-52 to subdue 7286-2 nations 1471 before 6440 him; and I will loose 6605-17 the loins 4975 of kings, 4428 to open 6605-2 before 6440 him the two leaved gates; 1817 and the gates 8179 shall not be shut; 5462-11

45:2 I will go 3212-4 before 6440 thee, and make the crooked places 1921-7 straight: 3474-17|3474-55-k I will break in pieces 7665-17 the gates 1817 of brass, 5154 and cut in sunder 1438-17 the bars 1280 of iron: 1270

45:3 And I will give 5414-1 thee the treasures 214 of darkness, 2822 and hidden riches 4301 of secret places, 4565 that thou mayest know 3045-4 that I, the LORD, 3068 which call 7121-6 [thee] by thy name, 8034 [am] the God 430 of Israel. 3478

45:4 For Jacob 3290 my servant's 5650 sake, and Israel 3478 mine elect, 972 I have even called 7121-4 thee by thy name: 8034 I have surnamed 3655-17 thee, though thou hast not known 3045-1 me.

45:5 I [am] the LORD, 3068 and [there is] none 369 else, 5750 [there is] no 369 God 430 beside 2108 me: I girded 247-17 thee, though thou hast not known 3045-1 me:

45:6 That they may know 3045-4 from the rising 4217 of the sun, 8121 and from the west, 4628 that [there is] none 657 beside 1107 me. I [am] the LORD, 3068 and [there is] none 369 else. 5750

45:7 I form 3335-6 the light, 216 and create 1254-6 darkness: 2822 I make 6213-6 peace, 7965 and create 1254-6 evil: 7451 I the LORD 3068 do 6213-6 all these [things].

45:8 Drop down, 7491-54 ye heavens, 8064 from above, 4605 and let the skies 7834 pour down 5140-4 righteousness: 6664 let the earth 776 open, 6605-4 and let them bring forth 6509-4 salvation, 3468 and let righteousness 6666 spring up 6779-55 together; 3162 I the LORD 3068 have created 1254-1 it.

45:9 Woe 1945 unto him that striveth 7378-5 with his Maker! 3335-6 [Let] the potsherd 2789 [strive] with the potsherds 2789 of the earth. 127 Shall the clay 2563 say 559-4 to him that fashioneth 3335-6 it, What makest 6213-4 thou? or thy work, 6467 He hath no hands? 3027

45:10 Woe 1945 unto him that saith 559-6 unto [his] father, 1 What begettest 3205-55 thou? or to the woman, 802 What hast thou brought forth? 2342-4

45:11 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 the Holy One 6918 of Israel, 3478 and his Maker, 3335-6 Ask 7592-3 me of things to come 857-6 concerning my sons, 1121 and concerning the work 6467 of my hands 3027 command 6680-17 ye me.

45:12 I have made 6213-1 the earth, 776 and created 1254-1 man 120 upon it: I, [even] my hands, 3027 have stretched out 5186-1 the heavens, 8064 and all their host 6635 have I commanded. 6680-14

45:13 I have raised him up 5782-52 in righteousness, 6664 and I will direct 3474-17 all his ways: 1870 he shall build 1129-4 my city, 5892 and he shall let go 7971-17 my captives, 1546 not for price 4242 nor reward, 7810 saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 of hosts. 6635

45:14 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 The labour 3018 of Egypt, 4714 and merchandise 5505 of Ethiopia 3568 and of the Sabeans, 5436 men 582 of stature, 4060 shall come over 5674-4 unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come 3212-4 after 310 thee; in chains 2131 they shall come over, 5674-4 and they shall fall down 7812-101 unto thee, they shall make supplication 6419-101 unto thee, [saying], Surely God 410 [is] in thee; and [there is] none else, [there is] no 657 God. 430

45:15 Verily 403 thou [art] a God 410 that hidest 5641-102 thyself, O God 430 of Israel, 3478 the Saviour. 3467-56

45:16 They shall be ashamed, 954-1 and also confounded, 3637-8 all of them: they shall go 1980-1 to confusion 3639 together 3162 [that are] makers 2796 of idols. 6736

45:17 [But] Israel 3478 shall be saved 3467-8 in the LORD 3068 with an everlasting 5769 salvation: 8668 ye shall not be ashamed 954-4 nor confounded 3637-11 world without end. 5769 5703

45:18 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 that created 1254-6 the heavens; 8064 God 430 himself that formed 3335-6 the earth 776 and made 6213-6 it; he hath established 3559-31 it, he created 1254-1 it not in vain, 8414 he formed 3335-1 it to be inhabited: 3427-2 I [am] the LORD; 3068 and [there is] none else.

45:19 I have not spoken 1696-14 in secret, 5643 in a dark 2822 place 4725 of the earth: 776 I said 559-1 not unto the seed 2233 of Jacob, 3290 Seek 1245-16 ye me in vain: 8414 I the LORD 3068 speak 1696-6 righteousness, 6664 I declare 5046-56 things that are right. 4339

45:20 Assemble 6908-10 yourselves and come; 935-3 draw near 5066-100 together, 3162 ye [that are] escaped 6412 of the nations: 1471 they have no knowledge 3045-1 that set up 5375-6 the wood 6086 of their graven image, 6459 and pray 6419-102 unto a god 410 [that] cannot save. 3467-55

45:21 Tell 5046-54 ye, and bring [them] near; 5066-54 yea, let them take counsel 3289-11 together: 3162 who hath declared 8085-52 this from ancient time? 6924 [who] hath told 5046-52 it from that time? [have] not I the LORD? 3068 and [there is] no God 430 else beside 2108 me; a just 6662 God 410 and a Saviour; 3467-56 [there is] none 369 beside 1107 me.

45:22 Look 6437-3 unto me, and be ye saved, 3467-10 all the ends 657 of the earth: 776 for I [am] God, 410 and [there is] none else.

45:23 I have sworn 7650-8 by myself, the word 1697 is gone out 3318-1 of my mouth 6310 [in] righteousness, 6666 and shall not return, 7725-4 That unto me every knee 1290 shall bow, 3766-4 every tongue 3956 shall swear. 7650-11

45:24 Surely, shall [one] say, 559-1 in the LORD 3068 have I righteousness 6666 and strength: 5797 [even] to him shall [men] come; 935-4 and all that are incensed 2734-12 against him shall be ashamed. 954-4

45:25 In the LORD 3068 shall all the seed 2233 of Israel 3478 be justified, 6663-4 and shall glory. 1984-101

46:1 Bel 1078 boweth down, 3766-1 Nebo 5015 stoopeth, 7164-6 their idols 6091 were upon the beasts, 2416 and upon the cattle: 929 your carriages 5385 [were] heavy loaden; 6006-7 [they are] a burden 4853 to the weary 5889 [beast].

46:2 They stoop, 7164-1 they bow down 3766-1 together; 3162 they could 3201-1 not deliver 4422-15 the burden, 4853 but themselves 5315 are gone 1980-1 into captivity. 7628

46:3 Hearken 8085-3 unto me, O house 1004 of Jacob, 3290 and all the remnant 7611 of the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 which are borne 6006-7 [by me] from the belly, 990 which are carried 5375-7 from the womb: 7356

46:4 And [even] to [your] old age 2209 I [am] he; and [even] to hoar hairs 7872 will I carry 5445-4 [you]: I have made, 6213-1 and I will bear; 5375-4 even I will carry, 5445-4 and will deliver 4422-17 [you].

46:5 To whom will ye liken 1819-17 me, and make [me] equal, 7737-55 and compare 4911-55 me, that we may be like? 1819-4

46:6 They lavish 2107-5 gold 2091 out of the bag, 3599 and weigh 8254-4 silver 3701 in the balance, 7070 [and] hire 7936-4 a goldsmith; 6884-6 and he maketh 6213-4 it a god: 410 they fall down, 5456-4 yea, they worship. 7812-101

46:7 They bear 5375-4 him upon the shoulder, 3802 they carry 5445-4 him, and set him 3240-55 in his place, 8478 and he standeth; 5975-4 from his place 4725 shall he not remove: 4185-55 yea, [one] shall cry 6817-4 unto him, yet can he not answer, 6030-4 nor save 3467-55 him out of his trouble. 6869

46:8 Remember 2142-3 this, and shew yourselves men: 377-103 bring [it] again 7725-54 to mind, 3820 O ye transgressors. 6586-6

46:9 Remember 2142-3 the former things 7223 of old: 5769 for I [am] God, 410 and [there is] none 369 else; 5750 [I am] God, 430 and [there is] none 657 like 3644 me,

46:10 Declaring 5046-56 the end 319 from the beginning, 7225 and from ancient times 6924 [the things] that are not [yet] done, 6213-8 saying, 559-6 My counsel 6098 shall stand, 6965-4 and I will do 6213-4 all my pleasure: 2656

46:11 Calling 7121-6 a ravenous bird 5861 from the east, 4217 the man 376 that executeth my counsel 6098 from a far 4801 country: 776 yea, I have spoken 1696-14 [it], I will also bring it to pass; 935-55 I have purposed 3335-1 [it], I will also do 6213-4 it.

46:12 Hearken 8085-3 unto me, ye stouthearted, 47 3820 that [are] far 7350 from righteousness: 6666

46:13 I bring near 7126-14 my righteousness; 6666 it shall not be far off, 7368-4 and my salvation 8668 shall not tarry: 309-17 and I will place 5414-1 salvation 8668 in Zion 6726 for Israel 3478 my glory. 8597

47:1 Come down, 3381-3 and sit 3427-3 in the dust, 6083 O virgin 1330 daughter 1323 of Babylon, 894 sit 3427-3 on the ground: 776 [there is] no throne, 3678 O daughter 1323 of the Chaldeans: 3778 for thou shalt no more 3254-55 be called 7121-4 tender 7390 and delicate. 6028

47:2 Take 3947-3 the millstones, 7347 and grind 2912-3 meal: 7058 uncover 1540-16 thy locks, 6777 make bare 2834-3 the leg, 7640 uncover 1540-16 the thigh, 7785 pass 5674-3 over the rivers. 5104

47:3 Thy nakedness 6172 shall be uncovered, 1540-11 yea, thy shame 2781 shall be seen: 7200-11 I will take 3947-4 vengeance, 5359 and I will not meet 6293-4 [thee as] a man. 120

47:4 [As for] our redeemer, 1350-6 the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 [is] his name, 8034 the Holy One 6918 of Israel. 3478

47:5 Sit 3427-3 thou silent, 1748 and get 935-3 thee into darkness, 2822 O daughter 1323 of the Chaldeans: 3778 for thou shalt no more 3254-55 be called, 7121-4 The lady 1404 of kingdoms. 4467

47:6 I was wroth 7107-1 with my people, 5971 I have polluted 2490-14 mine inheritance, 5159 and given 5414-4 them into thine hand: 3027 thou didst shew 7760-1 them no mercy; 7356 upon the ancient 2205 hast thou very 3966 heavily laid 3513-52 thy yoke. 5923

47:7 And thou saidst, 559-4 I shall be a lady 1404 for ever: 5769 [so] that thou didst not lay 7760-1 these [things] to thy heart, 3820 neither didst remember 2142-1 the latter end of it. 319

47:8 Therefore hear 8085-3 now this, [thou that art] given to pleasures, 5719 that dwellest 3427-6 carelessly, 983 that sayest 559-6 in thine heart, 3824 I [am], and none 657 else beside me; 5750 I shall not sit 3427-4 [as] a widow, 490 neither shall I know 3045-4 the loss of children: 7908

47:9 But these two 8147 [things] shall come 935-4 to thee in a moment 7281 in one 259 day, 3117 the loss of children, 7908 and widowhood: 489 they shall come 935-1 upon thee in their perfection 8537 for the multitude 7230 of thy sorceries, 3785 [and] for the great 3966 abundance 6109 of thine enchantments. 2267

47:10 For thou hast trusted 982-4 in thy wickedness: 7451 thou hast said, 559-1 None seeth 7200-6 me. Thy wisdom 2451 and thy knowledge, 1847 it hath perverted 7725-31 thee; and thou hast said 559-4 in thine heart, 3820 I [am], and none 657 else beside me. 5750

47:11 Therefore shall evil 7451 come 935-1 upon thee; thou shalt not know 3045-4 from whence it riseth: 7837 and mischief 1943 shall fall 5307-4 upon thee; thou shalt not be able 3201-4 to put it off: 3722-15 and desolation 7722 shall come 935-4 upon thee suddenly, 6597 [which] thou shalt not know. 3045-4

47:12 Stand 5975-3 now with thine enchantments, 2267 and with the multitude 7230 of thy sorceries, 3785 wherein 834 thou hast laboured 3021-1 from thy youth; 5271 if so be thou shalt be able 3201-4 to profit, 3276-53 if so be thou mayest prevail. 6206-4

47:13 Thou art wearied 3811-8 in the multitude 7230 of thy counsels. 6098 Let now the astrologers, 1895-6 8064 the stargazers, 2374 3556 the monthly 2320 prognosticators, 3045-56 stand up, 5975-4 and save 3467-55 thee from [these things] that shall come 935-4 upon thee.

47:14 Behold, they shall be as stubble; 7179 the fire 784 shall burn 8313-1 them; they shall not deliver 5337-55 themselves 5315 from the power 3027 of the flame: 3852 [there shall] not [be] a coal 1513 to warm 2552-2 at, [nor] fire 217 to sit 3427-2 before it.

47:15 Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, 3021-1 [even] thy merchants, 5503-6 from thy youth: 5271 they shall wander 8582-1 every one 376 to his quarter; 5676 none shall save 3467-56 thee.

48:1 Hear 8085-3 ye this, O house 1004 of Jacob, 3290 which are called 7121-12 by the name 8034 of Israel, 3478 and are come forth 3318-1 out of the waters 4325 of Judah, 3063 which swear 7650-12 by the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 and make mention 2142-55 of the God 430 of Israel, 3478 [but] not in truth, 571 nor in righteousness. 6666

48:2 For they call 7121-8 themselves of the holy 6944 city, 5892 and stay 5564-8 themselves upon the God 430 of Israel; 3478 The LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 [is] his name. 8034

48:3 I have declared 5046-52 the former things 7223 from the beginning; 227 and they went forth 3318-1 out of my mouth, 6310 and I shewed 8085-55 them; I did 6213-1 [them] suddenly, 6597 and they came to pass. 935-4

48:4 Because I knew 1847 that thou [art] obstinate, 7186 and thy neck 6203 [is] an iron 1270 sinew, 1517 and thy brow 4696 brass; 5154

48:5 I have even from the beginning 227 declared 5046-55 [it] to thee; before it came to pass 935-4 I shewed 8085-52 [it] thee: lest thou shouldest say, 559-4 Mine idol 6090 hath done 6213-1 them, and my graven image, 6459 and my molten image, 5262 hath commanded 6680-14 them.

48:6 Thou hast heard, 8085-1 see 2372-3 all this; and will not ye declare 5046-55 [it]? I have shewed 8085-52 thee new things 2319 from this time, 6258 even hidden things, 5341-7 and thou didst not know 3045-1 them.

48:7 They are created 1254-8 now, and not from the beginning; even before 6440 the day 3117 when thou heardest 8085-1 them not; lest thou shouldest say, 559-4 Behold, I knew 3045-1 them.

48:8 Yea, thou heardest 8085-1 not; yea, thou knewest 3045-1 not; yea, from that time [that] thine ear 241 was not opened: 6605-14 for I knew 3045-1 that thou wouldest deal very 898-2 treacherously, 898-4 and wast called 7121-27 a transgressor 6586-6 from the womb. 990

48:9 For my name's 8034 sake will I defer 748-55 mine anger, 639 and for my praise 8416 will I refrain 2413-4 for thee, that I cut thee not off. 3772-53

48:10 Behold, I have refined 6884-1 thee, but not with silver; 3701 I have chosen 977-1 thee in the furnace 3564 of affliction. 6040

48:11 For mine own sake, [even] for mine own sake, will I do 6213-4 [it]: for how should [my name] be polluted? 2490-11 and I will not give 5414-4 my glory 3519 unto another. 312

48:12 Hearken 8085-3 unto me, O Jacob 3290 and Israel, 3478 my called; 7121-30 I [am] he; I [am] the first, 7223 I also [am] the last. 314

48:13 Mine hand 3027 also hath laid the foundation 3245-1 of the earth, 776 and my right hand 3225 hath spanned 2946-14 the heavens: 8064 [when] I call 7121-6 unto them, they stand up 5975-4 together. 3162

48:14 All ye, assemble 6908-10 yourselves, and hear; 8085-3 which among them hath declared 5046-52 these [things]? The LORD 3068 hath loved 157-1 him: he will do 6213-4 his pleasure 2656 on Babylon, 894 and his arm 2220 [shall be on] the Chaldeans. 3778

48:15 I, [even] I, have spoken; 1696-14 yea, I have called 7121-1 him: I have brought 935-52 him, and he shall make his way 1870 prosperous. 6743-52

48:16 Come ye near 7126-3 unto me, hear 8085-3 ye this; I have not spoken 1696-14 in secret 5643 from the beginning; 7218 from the time 6256 that it was, there [am] I: and now the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 and his Spirit, 7307 hath sent 7971-1 me.

48:17 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 thy Redeemer, 1350-6 the Holy One 6918 of Israel; 3478 I [am] the LORD 3068 thy God 430 which teacheth 3925-18 thee to profit, 3276-53 which leadeth 1869-56 thee by the way 1870 [that] thou shouldest go. 3212-4

48:18 O that 3863 thou hadst hearkened 7181-52 to my commandments! 4687 then had thy peace 7965 been as a river, 5104 and thy righteousness 6666 as the waves 1530 of the sea: 3220

48:19 Thy seed 2233 also had been as the sand, 2344 and the offspring 6631 of thy bowels 4578 like the gravel 4579 thereof; his name 8034 should not have been cut off 3772-11 nor destroyed 8045-11 from before 6440 me.

48:20 Go ye forth 3318-3 of Babylon, 894 flee 1272-3 ye from the Chaldeans, 3778 with a voice 6963 of singing 7440 declare 5046-54 ye, tell 8085-54 this, utter 3318-54 it [even] to the end 7097 of the earth; 776 say 559-3 ye, The LORD 3068 hath redeemed 1350-1 his servant 5650 Jacob. 3290

48:21 And they thirsted 6770-1 not [when] he led 3212-52 them through the deserts: 2723 he caused the waters 4325 to flow 5140-52 out of the rock 6697 for them: he clave 1234-4 the rock 6697 also, and the waters 4325 gushed out. 2100-4

48:22 [There is] no peace, 7965 saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 unto the wicked. 7563

49:1 Listen, 8085-3 O isles, 339 unto me; and hearken, 7181-54 ye people, 3816 from far; 7350 The LORD 3068 hath called 7121-1 me from the womb; 990 from the bowels 4578 of my mother 517 hath he made mention 2142-52 of my name. 8034

49:2 And he hath made 7760-4 my mouth 6310 like a sharp 2299 sword; 2719 in the shadow 6738 of his hand 3027 hath he hid 2244-52 me, and made 7760-4 me a polished 1305-7 shaft; 2671 in his quiver 827 hath he hid 5641-52 me;

49:3 And said 559-4 unto me, Thou [art] my servant, 5650 O Israel, 3478 in whom I will be glorified. 6286-101

49:4 Then I said, 559-1 I have laboured 3021-1 in vain, 7385 I have spent 3615-14 my strength 3581 for nought, 8414 and in vain: 1892 [yet] surely 403 my judgment 4941 [is] with the LORD, 3068 and my work 6468 with my God. 430

49:5 And now, saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 that formed 3335-6 me from the womb 990 [to be] his servant, 5650 to bring Jacob 3290 again 7725-32 to him, Though Israel 3478 be not gathered, 622-11 yet shall I be glorious 3513-11 in the eyes 5869 of the LORD, 3068 and my God 430 shall be my strength. 5797

49:6 And he said, 559-4 It is a light thing 7043-8 that thou shouldest be my servant 5650 to raise up 6965-53 the tribes 7626 of Jacob, 3290 and to restore 7725-53 the preserved 5341-7|5336-k of Israel: 3478 I will also give 5414-1 thee for a light 216 to the Gentiles, 1471 that thou mayest be my salvation 3444 unto the end 7097 of the earth. 776

49:7 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 the Redeemer 1350-6 of Israel, 3478 [and] his Holy One, 6918 to him whom man 5315 despiseth, 960 to him whom the nation 1471 abhorreth, 8581-18 to a servant 5650 of rulers, 4910-6 Kings 4428 shall see 7200-4 and arise, 6965-1 princes 8269 also shall worship, 7812-101 because of the LORD 3068 that is faithful, 539-12 [and] the Holy One 6918 of Israel, 3478 and he shall choose 977-4 thee.

49:8 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 In an acceptable 7522 time 6256 have I heard 6030-1 thee, and in a day 3117 of salvation 3444 have I helped 5826-1 thee: and I will preserve 5341-4 thee, and give 5414-4 thee for a covenant 1285 of the people, 5971 to establish 6965-53 the earth, 776 to cause to inherit 5157-53 the desolate 8074-6 heritages; 5159

49:9 That thou mayest say 559-2 to the prisoners, 631-7 Go forth; 3318-3 to them that [are] in darkness, 2822 Shew 1540-10 yourselves. They shall feed 7462-4 in the ways, 1870 and their pastures 4830 [shall be] in all high places. 8205

49:10 They shall not hunger 7456-4 nor thirst; 6770-4 neither shall the heat 8273 nor sun 8121 smite 5221-55 them: for he that hath mercy 7355-18 on them shall lead 5090-17 them, even by the springs 4002 of water 4325 shall he guide 5095-17 them.

49:11 And I will make 7760-1 all my mountains 2022 a way, 1870 and my highways 4546 shall be exalted. 7311-4

49:12 Behold, these shall come 935-4 from far: 7350 and, lo, these from the north 6828 and from the west; 3220 and these from the land 776 of Sinim. 5515

49:13 Sing, 7442-3 O heavens; 8064 and be joyful, 1523-3 O earth; 776 and break forth 6476-3 into singing, 7440 O mountains: 2022 for the LORD 3068 hath comforted 5162-14 his people, 5971 and will have mercy 7355-17 upon his afflicted. 6041

49:14 But Zion 6726 said, 559-4 The LORD 3068 hath forsaken 5800-1 me, and my Lord 136 hath forgotten 7911-1 me.

49:15 Can a woman 802 forget 7911-4 her sucking child, 5764 that she should not have compassion 7355-15 on the son 1121 of her womb? 990 yea, they may forget, 7911-4 yet will I not forget 7911-4 thee.

49:16 Behold, I have graven 2710-1 thee upon the palms of [my] hands; 3709 thy walls 2346 [are] continually 8548 before me.

49:17 Thy children 1121 shall make haste; 4116-14 thy destroyers 2040-18 and they that made thee waste 2717-56 shall go forth 3318-4 of thee.

49:18 Lift up 5375-3 thine eyes 5869 round about, 5439 and behold: 7200-3 all these gather themselves together, 6908-8 [and] come 935-1 to thee. [As] I live, 2416 saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 thou shalt surely clothe 3847-4 thee with them all, as with an ornament, 5716 and bind 7194-17 them [on thee], as a bride 3618 [doeth].

49:19 For thy waste 2723 and thy desolate places, 8074-6 and the land 776 of thy destruction, 2035 shall even now be too narrow 3334-4 by reason of the inhabitants, 3427-6 and they that swallowed thee up 1104-18 shall be far away. 7368-1

49:20 The children 1121 which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost 7923 the other, shall say 559-4 again in thine ears, 241 The place 4725 [is] too strait 6862 for me: give place 5066-3 to me that I may dwell. 3427-4

49:21 Then shalt thou say 559-1 in thine heart, 3824 Who hath begotten 3205-1 me these, seeing I have lost my children, 7921-7 and am desolate, 1565 a captive, 1540-6 and removing to and fro? 5493-7 and who hath brought up 1431-14 these? Behold, I was left 7604-8 alone; these, where 375 [had] they [been]?

49:22 Thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 Behold, I will lift up 5375-4 mine hand 3027 to the Gentiles, 1471 and set up 7311-55 my standard 5251 to the people: 5971 and they shall bring 935-52 thy sons 1121 in [their] arms, 2684 and thy daughters 1323 shall be carried 5375-11 upon [their] shoulders. 3802

49:23 And kings 4428 shall be thy nursing fathers, 539-6 and their queens 8282 thy nursing mothers: 3243-56 they shall bow down 7812-101 to thee with [their] face 639 toward the earth, 776 and lick up 3897-17 the dust 6083 of thy feet; 7272 and thou shalt know 3045-1 that I [am] the LORD: 3068 for they shall not be ashamed 954-4 that wait 6960-6 for me.

49:24 Shall the prey 4455 be taken 3947-93 from the mighty, 1368 or the lawful 6662 captive 7628 delivered? 4422-11

49:25 But thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Even the captives 7628 of the mighty 1368 shall be taken away, 3947-93 and the prey 4455 of the terrible 6184 shall be delivered: 4422-11 for I will contend 7378-4 with him that contendeth 3401 with thee, and I will save 3467-55 thy children. 1121

49:26 And I will feed 398-52 them that oppress 3238-56 thee with their own flesh; 1320 and they shall be drunken 7937-4 with their own blood, 1818 as with sweet wine: 6071 and all flesh 1320 shall know 3045-1 that I the LORD 3068 [am] thy Saviour 3467-56 and thy Redeemer, 1350-6 the mighty 46 One of Jacob. 3290

50:1 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Where [is] the bill 5612 of your mother's 517 divorcement, 3748 whom I have put away? 7971-14 or which of my creditors 5383-6 [is it] to whom I have sold 4376-1 you? Behold, for your iniquities 5771 have ye sold 4376-8 yourselves, and for your transgressions 6588 is your mother 517 put away. 7971-27

50:2 Wherefore, when I came, 935-1 [was there] no man? 376 when I called, 7121-1 [was there] none to answer? 6030-6 Is my hand 3027 shortened 7114-1 at all, 7114-2 that it cannot redeem? 6304 or have I no power 3581 to deliver? 5337-53 behold, at my rebuke 1606 I dry up 2717-55 the sea, 3220 I make 7760-4 the rivers 5104 a wilderness: 4057 their fish 1710 stinketh, 887-4 because [there is] no water, 4325 and dieth 4191-4 for thirst. 6772

50:3 I clothe 3847-55 the heavens 8064 with blackness, 6940 and I make 7760-4 sackcloth 8242 their covering. 3682

50:4 The Lord 136 GOD 3069 hath given 5414-1 me the tongue 3956 of the learned, 3928 that I should know 3045-2 how to speak 5790-2 a word 1697 in season to [him that is] weary: 3287 he wakeneth 5782-55 morning 1242 by morning, 1242 he wakeneth 5782-55 mine ear 241 to hear 8085-2 as the learned. 3928

50:5 The Lord 136 GOD 3069 hath opened 6605-1 mine ear, 241 and I was not rebellious, 4784-1 neither turned away 5472-8 back. 268

50:6 I gave 5414-1 my back 1460 to the smiters, 5221-56 and my cheeks 3895 to them that plucked off the hair: 4803-6 I hid 5641-52 not my face 6440 from shame 3639 and spitting. 7536

50:7 For the Lord 136 GOD 3069 will help 5826-4 me; therefore shall I not be confounded: 3637-8 therefore have I set 7760-1 my face 6440 like a flint, 2496 and I know 3045-4 that I shall not be ashamed. 954-4

50:8 [He is] near 7138 that justifieth 6663-56 me; who will contend 7378-4 with me? let us stand 5975-4 together: 3162 who [is] mine adversary? 1167 4941 let him come near 5066-4 to me.

50:9 Behold, the Lord 136 GOD 3069 will help 5826-4 me; who [is] he [that] shall condemn 7561-55 me? lo, they all shall wax old 1086-4 as a garment; 899 the moth 6211 shall eat 398-4 them up.

50:10 Who [is] among you that feareth 3373 the LORD, 3068 that obeyeth 8085-6 the voice 6963 of his servant, 5650 that walketh 1980-1 [in] darkness, 2825 and hath no light? 5051 let him trust 982-4 in the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 and stay 8172-11 upon his God. 430

50:11 Behold, all ye that kindle 6919-6 a fire, 784 that compass [yourselves] about 247-18 with sparks: 2131 walk 3212-3 in the light 217 of your fire, 784 and in the sparks 2131 [that] ye have kindled. 1197-14 This shall ye have of mine hand; 3027 ye shall lie down 7901-4 in sorrow. 4620

51:1 Hearken 8085-3 to me, ye that follow after 7291-6 righteousness, 6664 ye that seek 1245-18 the LORD: 3068 look 5027-54 unto the rock 6697 [whence] ye are hewn, 2672-27 and to the hole 4718 of the pit 953 [whence] ye are digged. 5365-27

51:2 Look 5027-54 unto Abraham 85 your father, 1 and unto Sarah 8283 [that] bare 2342-34 you: for I called 7121-1 him alone, 259 and blessed 1288-17 him, and increased 7235-55 him.

51:3 For the LORD 3068 shall comfort 5162-14 Zion: 6726 he will comfort 5162-14 all her waste places; 2723 and he will make 7760-4 her wilderness 4057 like Eden, 5731 and her desert 6160 like the garden 1588 of the LORD; 3068 joy 8342 and gladness 8057 shall be found 4672-11 therein, thanksgiving, 8426 and the voice 6963 of melody. 2172

51:4 Hearken 7181-54 unto me, my people; 5971 and give ear 238-54 unto me, O my nation: 3816 for a law 8451 shall proceed 3318-4 from me, and I will make my judgment 4941 to rest 7280-55 for a light 216 of the people. 5971

51:5 My righteousness 6664 [is] near; 7138 my salvation 3468 is gone forth, 3318-1 and mine arms 2220 shall judge 8199-4 the people; 5971 the isles 339 shall wait 6960-17 upon me, and on mine arm 2220 shall they trust. 3176-17

51:6 Lift up 5375-3 your eyes 5869 to the heavens, 8064 and look 5027-54 upon the earth 776 beneath: for the heavens 8064 shall vanish away 4414-8 like smoke, 6227 and the earth 776 shall wax old 1086-4 like a garment, 899 and they that dwell 3427-6 therein shall die 4191-4 in like 3644 manner: 3654 but my salvation 3444 shall be for ever, 5769 and my righteousness 6666 shall not be abolished. 2865-11

51:7 Hearken 8085-3 unto me, ye that know 3045-6 righteousness, 6664 the people 5971 in whose heart 3820 [is] my law; 8451 fear 3372-4 ye not the reproach 2781 of men, 582 neither be ye afraid 2865-11 of their revilings. 1421

51:8 For the moth 6211 shall eat 398-4 them up like a garment, 899 and the worm 5580 shall eat 398-4 them like wool: 6785 but my righteousness 6666 shall be for ever, 5769 and my salvation 3444 from generation 1755 to generation. 1755

51:9 Awake, 5782-3 awake, 5782-3 put on 3847-3 strength, 5797 O arm 2220 of the LORD; 3068 awake, 5782-3 as in the ancient 6924 days, 3117 in the generations 1755 of old. 5769 [Art] thou not it that hath cut 2672-56 Rahab, 7294 [and] wounded 2490-26 the dragon? 8577

51:10 [Art] thou not it which hath dried 2717-56 the sea, 3220 the waters 4325 of the great 7227 deep; 8415 that hath made 7760-1 the depths 4615 of the sea 3220 a way 1870 for the ransomed 1350-7 to pass over? 5674-2

51:11 Therefore the redeemed 6299-7 of the LORD 3068 shall return, 7725-4 and come 935-1 with singing 7440 unto Zion; 6726 and everlasting 5769 joy 8057 [shall be] upon their head: 7218 they shall obtain 5381-55 gladness 8342 and joy; 8057 [and] sorrow 3015 and mourning 585 shall flee away. 5127-1

51:12 I, [even] I, [am] he that comforteth 5162-18 you: who [art] thou, that thou shouldest be afraid 3372-4 of a man 582 [that] shall die, 4191-4 and of the son 1121 of man 120 [which] shall be made 5414-11 [as] grass; 2682

51:13 And forgettest 7911-4 the LORD 3068 thy maker, 6213-6 that hath stretched forth 5186-6 the heavens, 8064 and laid the foundations 3245-5 of the earth; 776 and hast feared 6342-17 continually 8548 every day 3117 because 6440 of the fury 2534 of the oppressor, 6693-56 as if 834 he were ready 3559-31 to destroy? 7843-53 and where [is] the fury 2534 of the oppressor? 6693-56

51:14 The captive exile 6808-6 hasteneth 4116-14 that he may be loosed, 6605-9 and that he should not die 4191-4 in the pit, 7845 nor that his bread 3899 should fail. 2637-4

51:15 But I [am] the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 that divided 7280-6 the sea, 3220 whose waves 1530 roared: 1993-4 The LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 [is] his name. 8034

51:16 And I have put 7760-4 my words 1697 in thy mouth, 6310 and I have covered 3680-14 thee in the shadow 6738 of mine hand, 3027 that I may plant 5193-2 the heavens, 8064 and lay the foundations 3245-2 of the earth, 776 and say 559-2 unto Zion, 6726 Thou [art] my people. 5971

51:17 Awake, 5782-112 awake, 5782-112 stand up, 6965-3 O Jerusalem, 3389 which hast drunk 8354-1 at the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 the cup 3563 of his fury; 2534 thou hast drunken 8354-1 the dregs 6907 of the cup 3563 of trembling, 8653 [and] wrung [them] out. 4680-1

51:18 [There is] none to guide 5095-18 her among all the sons 1121 [whom] she hath brought forth; 3205-1 neither [is there any] that taketh 2388-56 her by the hand 3027 of all the sons 1121 [that] she hath brought up. 1431-14

51:19 These two 8147 [things] are come 7122-6 unto thee; who shall be sorry 5110-4 for thee? desolation, 7701 and destruction, 7667 and the famine, 7458 and the sword: 2719 by whom shall I comfort 5162-17 thee?

51:20 Thy sons 1121 have fainted, 5968-27 they lie 7901-1 at the head 7218 of all the streets, 2351 as a wild bull 8377 in a net: 4364 they are full 4392 of the fury 2534 of the LORD, 3068 the rebuke 1606 of thy God. 430

51:21 Therefore hear 8085-3 now this, thou afflicted, 6041 and drunken, 7937-7 but not with wine: 3196

51:22 Thus saith 559-1 thy Lord 113 the LORD, 3068 and thy God 430 [that] pleadeth 7378-4 the cause of his people, 5971 Behold, I have taken 3947-1 out of thine hand 3027 the cup 3563 of trembling, 8653 [even] the dregs 6907 of the cup 3563 of my fury; 2534 thou shalt no more 3254-55 drink 8354-2 it again:

51:23 But I will put 7760-1 it into the hand 3027 of them that afflict 3013-56 thee; which have said 559-1 to thy soul, 5315 Bow down, 7812-3 that we may go over: 5674-4 and thou hast laid 7760-4 thy body 1460 as the ground, 776 and as the street, 2351 to them that went over. 5674-6

52:1 Awake, 5782-3 awake; 5782-3 put on 3847-3 thy strength, 5797 O Zion; 6726 put on 3847-3 thy beautiful 8597 garments, 899 O Jerusalem, 3389 the holy 6944 city: 5892 for henceforth there shall no more 3254-55 come 935-4 into thee the uncircumcised 6189 and the unclean. 2931

52:2 Shake 5287-100 thyself from the dust; 6083 arise, 6965-3 [and] sit down, 3427-3 O Jerusalem: 3389 loose 6605-100 thyself from the bands 4147 of thy neck, 6677 O captive 7628 daughter 1323 of Zion. 6726

52:3 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Ye have sold 4376-8 yourselves for nought; 2600 and ye shall be redeemed 1350-11 without money. 3701

52:4 For thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 My people 5971 went down 3381-1 aforetime 7223 into Egypt 4714 to sojourn 1481-2 there; and the Assyrian 804 oppressed 6231-1 them without cause. 657

52:5 Now therefore, what have I here, saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 that my people 5971 is taken away 3947-27 for nought? 2600 they that rule 4910-6 over them make them to howl, 3213-55 saith 5002-7 the LORD; 3068 and my name 8034 continually 8548 every day 3117 [is] blasphemed. 5006-114

52:6 Therefore my people 5971 shall know 3045-4 my name: 8034 therefore [they shall know] in that day 3117 that I [am] he that doth speak: 1696-18 behold, [it is] I.

52:7 How beautiful 4998-43 upon the mountains 2022 are the feet 7272 of him that bringeth good tidings, 1319-18 that publisheth 8085-56 peace; 7965 that bringeth good tidings 1319-18 of good, 2896 that publisheth 8085-56 salvation; 3444 that saith 559-6 unto Zion, 6726 Thy God 430 reigneth! 4427-1

52:8 Thy watchmen 6822-6 shall lift up 5375-1 the voice; 6963 with the voice 6963 together 3162 shall they sing: 7442-17 for they shall see 7200-4 eye 5869 to eye, 5869 when the LORD 3068 shall bring again 7725-2 Zion. 6726

52:9 Break forth into joy, 6476-3 sing 7442-16 together, 3162 ye waste places 2723 of Jerusalem: 3389 for the LORD 3068 hath comforted 5162-14 his people, 5971 he hath redeemed 1350-1 Jerusalem. 3389

52:10 The LORD 3068 hath made bare 2834-1 his holy 6944 arm 2220 in the eyes 5869 of all the nations; 1471 and all the ends 657 of the earth 776 shall see 7200-1 the salvation 3444 of our God. 430

52:11 Depart 5493-3 ye, depart 5493-3 ye, go ye out 3318-3 from thence, touch 5060-4 no unclean 2931 [thing]; go ye out 3318-3 of the midst 8432 of her; be ye clean, 1305-10 that bear 5375-6 the vessels 3627 of the LORD. 3068

52:12 For ye shall not go out 3318-4 with haste, 2649 nor go 3212-4 by flight: 4499 for the LORD 3068 will go 1980-6 before 6440 you; and the God 430 of Israel 3478 [will be] your rereward. 622-18

52:13 Behold, my servant 5650 shall deal prudently, 7919-55 he shall be exalted 7311-4 and extolled, 5375-8 and be very 3966 high. 1361-1

52:14 As many 7227 were astonied 8074-1 at thee; his visage 4758 was so marred 4893 more than any man, 376 and his form 8389 more than the sons 1121 of men: 120

52:15 So shall he sprinkle 5137-55 many 7227 nations; 1471 the kings 4428 shall shut 7092-4 their mouths 6310 at him: for [that] which had not been told 5608-27 them shall they see; 7200-1 and [that] which they had not heard 8085-1 shall they consider. 995-110

53:1 Who hath believed 539-52 our report? 8052 and to whom is the arm 2220 of the LORD 3068 revealed? 1540-8

53:2 For he shall grow up 5927-4 before 6440 him as a tender plant, 3126 and as a root 8328 out of a dry 6723 ground: 776 he hath no form 8389 nor comeliness; 1926 and when we shall see 7200-4 him, [there is] no beauty 4758 that we should desire 2530-4 him.

53:3 He is despised 959-12 and rejected 2310 of men; 376 a man 376 of sorrows, 4341 and acquainted 3045-7 with grief: 2483 and we hid as it were 4564-56 [our] faces 6440 from him; he was despised, 959-12 and we esteemed 2803-1 him not.

53:4 Surely 403 he hath borne 5375-1 our griefs, 2483 and carried 5445-1 our sorrows: 4341 yet we did esteem 2803-1 him stricken, 5060-7 smitten 5221-94 of God, 430 and afflicted. 6031-30

53:5 But he [was] wounded 2490-21 for our transgressions, 6588 [he was] bruised 1792-30 for our iniquities: 5771 the chastisement 4148 of our peace 7965 [was] upon him; and with his stripes 2250 we are healed. 7495-8

53:6 All we like sheep 6629 have gone astray; 8582-1 we have turned 6437-1 every one 376 to his own way; 1870 and the LORD 3068 hath laid 6293-52 on him the iniquity 5771 of us all.

53:7 He was oppressed, 5065-8 and he was afflicted, 6031-12 yet he opened 6605-4 not his mouth: 6310 he is brought 2986-93 as a lamb 7716 to the slaughter, 2874 and as a sheep 7353 before 6440 her shearers 1494-6 is dumb, 481-8 so he openeth 6605-4 not his mouth. 6310

53:8 He was taken 3947-27 from prison 6115 and from judgment: 4941 and who shall declare 7878-34 his generation? 1755 for he was cut off 1504-8 out of the land 776 of the living: 2416 for the transgression 6588 of my people 5971 was he stricken. 5061

53:9 And he made 5414-4 his grave 6913 with the wicked, 7563 and with the rich 6223 in his death; 4194 because he had done 6213-1 no violence, 2555 neither [was any] deceit 4820 in his mouth. 6310

53:10 Yet it pleased 2654-1 the LORD 3068 to bruise 1792-15 him; he hath put [him] to grief: 2470-52 when thou shalt make 7760-4 his soul 5315 an offering for sin, 817 he shall see 7200-4 [his] seed, 2233 he shall prolong 748-55 [his] days, 3117 and the pleasure 2656 of the LORD 3068 shall prosper 6743-4 in his hand. 3027

53:11 He shall see 7200-4 of the travail 5999 of his soul, 5315 [and] shall be satisfied: 7646-4 by his knowledge 1847 shall my righteous 6662 servant 5650 justify 6663-55 many; 7227 for he shall bear 5445-4 their iniquities. 5771

53:12 Therefore will I divide 2505-17 him [a portion] with the great, 7227 and he shall divide 2505-17 the spoil 7998 with the strong; 6099 because he hath poured out 6168-52 his soul 5315 unto death: 4194 and he was numbered 4487-8 with the transgressors; 6586-6 and he bare 5375-1 the sin 2399 of many, 7227 and made intercession 6293-55 for the transgressors. 6586-6

54:1 Sing, 7442-3 O barren, 6135 thou [that] didst not bear; 3205-1 break forth 6476-3 into singing, 7440 and cry aloud, 6670-16 thou [that] didst not travail with child: 2342-1 for more 7227 [are] the children 1121 of the desolate 8074-6 than the children 1121 of the married wife, 1166-7 saith 559-1 the LORD. 3068

54:2 Enlarge 7337-54 the place 4725 of thy tent, 168 and let them stretch forth 5186-55 the curtains 3407 of thine habitations: 4908 spare 2820-4 not, lengthen 748-54 thy cords, 4340 and strengthen 2388-16 thy stakes; 3489

54:3 For thou shalt break forth 6555-4 on the right hand 3225 and on the left; 8040 and thy seed 2233 shall inherit 3423-4 the Gentiles, 1471 and make the desolate 8074-12 cities 5892 to be inhabited. 3427-55

54:4 Fear 3372-4 not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: 954-4 neither be thou confounded; 3637-11 for thou shalt not be put to shame: 2659-55 for thou shalt forget 7911-4 the shame 1322 of thy youth, 5934 and shalt not remember 2142-4 the reproach 2781 of thy widowhood 491 any more.

54:5 For thy Maker 6213-6 [is] thine husband; 1166-6 the LORD 3068 of hosts 6635 [is] his name; 8034 and thy Redeemer 1350-6 the Holy One 6918 of Israel; 3478 The God 430 of the whole earth 776 shall he be called. 7121-11

54:6 For the LORD 3068 hath called 7121-1 thee as a woman 802 forsaken 5800-7 and grieved 6087-7 in spirit, 7307 and a wife 802 of youth, 5271 when thou wast refused, 3988-11 saith 559-1 thy God. 430

54:7 For a small 6996 moment 7281 have I forsaken 5800-1 thee; but with great 1419 mercies 7356 will I gather 6908-17 thee.

54:8 In a little 8241 wrath 7110 I hid 5641-52 my face 6440 from thee for a moment; 7281 but with everlasting 5769 kindness 2617 will I have mercy 7355-14 on thee, saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 thy Redeemer. 1350-6

54:9 For this [is as] the waters 4325 of Noah 5146 unto me: for [as] I have sworn 7650-8 that the waters 4325 of Noah 5146 should no more go over 5674-2 the earth; 776 so have I sworn 7650-8 that I would not be wroth 7107-2 with thee, nor rebuke 1605-2 thee.

54:10 For the mountains 2022 shall depart, 4185-4 and the hills 1389 be removed; 4131-4 but my kindness 2617 shall not depart 4185-4 from thee, neither shall the covenant 1285 of my peace 7965 be removed, 4131-4 saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 that hath mercy 7355-18 on thee.

54:11 O thou afflicted, 6041 tossed with tempest, 5590-6 [and] not comforted, 5162-30 behold, I will lay 7257-56 thy stones 68 with fair colours, 6320 and lay thy foundations 3245-1 with sapphires. 5601

54:12 And I will make 7760-1 thy windows 8121 of agates, 3539 and thy gates 8179 of carbuncles, 68 688 and all thy borders 1366 of pleasant 2656 stones. 68

54:13 And all thy children 1121 [shall be] taught 3928 of the LORD; 3068 and great 7227 [shall be] the peace 7965 of thy children. 1121

54:14 In righteousness 6666 shalt thou be established: 3559-113 thou shalt be far 7368-3 from oppression; 6233 for thou shalt not fear: 3372-4 and from terror; 4288 for it shall not come near 7126-4 thee.

54:15 Behold, they shall surely 1481-2 gather together, 1481-4 [but] not 657 by me: whosoever 4310 shall gather together 1481-1 against thee shall fall 5307-4 for thy sake.

54:16 Behold, I have created 1254-1 the smith 2796 that bloweth 5301-6 the coals 6352 in the fire, 784 and that bringeth forth 3318-56 an instrument 3627 for his work; 4639 and I have created 1254-1 the waster 7843-56 to destroy. 2254-15

54:17 No weapon 3627 that is formed 3335-93 against thee shall prosper; 6743-4 and every tongue 3956 [that] shall rise 6965-4 against thee in judgment 4941 thou shalt condemn. 7561-55 This [is] the heritage 5159 of the servants 5650 of the LORD, 3068 and their righteousness 6666 [is] of me, saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

55:1 Ho, 1945 every one that thirsteth, 6771 come 3212-3 ye to the waters, 4325 and he that hath no money; 3701 come 3212-3 ye, buy, 7666-3 and eat; 398-3 yea, come, 3212-3 buy 7666-3 wine 3196 and milk 2461 without money 3701 and without price. 4242

55:2 Wherefore do ye spend 8254-4 money 3701 for [that which is] not 3808 bread? 3899 and your labour 3018 for [that which] satisfieth 7654 not? 3808 hearken 8085-3 diligently 8085-2 unto me, and eat 398-3 ye [that which is] good, 2896 and let your soul 5315 delight 6026-101 itself in fatness. 1880

55:3 Incline 5186-54 your ear, 241 and come 3212-3 unto me: hear, 8085-3 and your soul 5315 shall live; 2421-4 and I will make 3772-4 an everlasting 5769 covenant 1285 with you, [even] the sure 539-12 mercies 2617 of David. 1732

55:4 Behold, I have given 5414-1 him [for] a witness 5707 to the people, 3816 a leader 5057 and commander 6680-18 to the people. 3816

55:5 Behold, thou shalt call 7121-4 a nation 1471 [that] thou knowest 3045-4 not, and nations 1471 [that] knew 3045-1 not thee shall run 7323-4 unto thee because of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and for the Holy One 6918 of Israel; 3478 for he hath glorified 6286-14 thee.

55:6 Seek 1875-3 ye the LORD 3068 while he may be found, 4672-9 call 7121-3 ye upon him while he is near: 7138

55:7 Let the wicked 7563 forsake 5800-4 his way, 1870 and the unrighteous 205 man 376 his thoughts: 4284 and let him return 7725-4 unto the LORD, 3068 and he will have mercy 7355-17 upon him; and to our God, 430 for he will abundantly 7235-55 pardon. 5545-2

55:8 For my thoughts 4284 [are] not your thoughts, 4284 neither [are] your ways 1870 my ways, 1870 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

55:9 For [as] the heavens 8064 are higher 1361-1 than the earth, 776 so are my ways 1870 higher 1361-1 than your ways, 1870 and my thoughts 4284 than your thoughts. 4284

55:10 For as the rain 1653 cometh down, 3381-4 and the snow 7950 from heaven, 8064 and returneth 7725-4 not thither, but watereth 7301-52 the earth, 776 and maketh it bring forth 3205-52 and bud, 6779-52 that it may give 5414-1 seed 2233 to the sower, 2232-6 and bread 3899 to the eater: 398-6

55:11 So shall my word 1697 be that goeth forth 3318-4 out of my mouth: 6310 it shall not return 7725-4 unto me void, 7387 but it shall accomplish 6213-1 that which I please, 2654-1 and it shall prosper 6743-52 [in the thing] whereto I sent 7971-1 it.

55:12 For ye shall go out 3318-4 with joy, 8057 and be led forth 2986-93 with peace: 7965 the mountains 2022 and the hills 1389 shall break forth 6476-4 before 6440 you into singing, 7440 and all the trees 6086 of the field 7704 shall clap 4222-4 [their] hands. 3709

55:13 Instead of the thorn 5285 shall come up 5927-4 the fir tree, 1265 and instead of the brier 5636 shall come up 5927-4 the myrtle tree: 1918 and it shall be to the LORD 3068 for a name, 8034 for an everlasting 5769 sign 226 [that] shall not be cut off. 3772-11

56:1 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Keep 8104-3 ye judgment, 4941 and do 6213-3 justice: 6666 for my salvation 3444 [is] near 7138 to come, 935-2 and my righteousness 6666 to be revealed. 1540-9

56:2 Blessed 835 [is] the man 582 [that] doeth 6213-4 this, and the son 1121 of man 120 [that] layeth hold 2388-55 on it; that keepeth 8104-6 the sabbath 7676 from polluting 2490-15 it, and keepeth 8104-6 his hand 3027 from doing 6213-2 any evil. 7451

56:3 Neither let the son 1121 of the stranger, 5236 that hath joined 3867-8 himself to the LORD, 3068 speak, 559-4 saying, 559-2 The LORD 3068 hath utterly 914-53 separated 914-55 me from his people: 5971 neither let the eunuch 5631 say, 559-4 Behold, I [am] a dry 3002 tree. 6086

56:4 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD 3068 unto the eunuchs 5631 that keep 8104-4 my sabbaths, 7676 and choose 977-1 [the things] that please 2654-1 me, and take hold 2388-56 of my covenant; 1285

56:5 Even unto them will I give 5414-1 in mine house 1004 and within my walls 2346 a place 3027 and a name 8034 better 2896 than of sons 1121 and of daughters: 1323 I will give 5414-4 them an everlasting 5769 name, 8034 that shall not be cut off. 3772-11

56:6 Also the sons 1121 of the stranger, 5236 that join 3867-12 themselves to the LORD, 3068 to serve 8334-15 him, and to love 157-2 the name 8034 of the LORD, 3068 to be his servants, 5650 every one that keepeth 8104-6 the sabbath 7676 from polluting 2490-15 it, and taketh hold 2388-56 of my covenant; 1285

56:7 Even them will I bring 935-52 to my holy 6944 mountain, 2022 and make them joyful 8055-14 in my house 1004 of prayer: 8605 their burnt offerings 5930 and their sacrifices 2077 [shall be] accepted 7522 upon mine altar; 4196 for mine house 1004 shall be called 7121-11 an house 1004 of prayer 8605 for all people. 5971

56:8 The Lord 136 GOD 3069 which gathereth 6908-18 the outcasts 1760-12 of Israel 3478 saith, 5002-7 Yet will I gather 6908-17 [others] to him, beside those that are gathered 6908-12 unto him.

56:9 All ye beasts 2416 of the field, 7704 come 857-3 to devour, 398-2 [yea], all ye beasts 2416 in the forest. 3293

56:10 His watchmen 6822-6 [are] blind: 5787 they are all ignorant, 3808 3045-1 they [are] all dumb 483 dogs, 3611 they cannot 3808 3201-4 bark; 5024-2 sleeping, 1957-6 lying down, 7901-6 loving 157-6 to slumber. 5123-2

56:11 Yea, [they are] greedy 5794 5315 dogs 3611 [which] can never 3808 have 3045-1 enough, 7654 and they [are] shepherds 7462-6 [that] cannot 3808 3045-1 understand: 995-53 they all look 6437-1 to their own way, 1870 every one 376 for his gain, 1215 from his quarter. 7097

56:12 Come 857-3 ye, [say they], I will fetch 3947-4 wine, 3196 and we will fill 5433-4 ourselves with strong drink; 7941 and to morrow 4279 shall be as this day, 3117 [and] much 3966 more 1419 abundant. 3499

57:1 The righteous 6662 perisheth, 6-1 and no man 376 layeth 7760-6 [it] to heart: 3820 and merciful 2617 men 582 [are] taken away, 622-12 none considering 995-56 that the righteous 6662 is taken away 622-8 from 6440 the evil 7451 [to come].

57:2 He shall enter 935-4 into peace: 7965 they shall rest 5117-4 in their beds, 4904 [each one] walking 1980-6 [in] his uprightness. 5228

57:3 But draw near 7126-3 hither, ye sons 1121 of the sorceress, 6049-26 the seed 2233 of the adulterer 5003-18 and the whore. 2181-4

57:4 Against whom do ye sport 6026-101 yourselves? against whom make ye a wide 7337-55 mouth, 6310 [and] draw out 748-55 the tongue? 3956 [are] ye not children 3206 of transgression, 6588 a seed 2233 of falsehood, 8267

57:5 Enflaming 2552-12 yourselves with idols 410 under every green 7488 tree, 6086 slaying 7819-6 the children 3206 in the valleys 5158 under the clifts 5585 of the rocks? 5553

57:6 Among the smooth 2511 [stones] of the stream 5158 [is] thy portion; 2506 they, they [are] thy lot: 1486 even to them hast thou poured 8210-1 a drink offering, 5262 thou hast offered 5927-52 a meat offering. 4503 Should I receive comfort 5162-11 in these?

57:7 Upon a lofty 1364 and high 5375-12 mountain 2022 hast thou set 7760-1 thy bed: 4904 even thither wentest thou up 5927-1 to offer 2076-2 sacrifice. 2077

57:8 Behind 310 the doors 1817 also and the posts 4201 hast thou set up 7760-1 thy remembrance: 2146 for thou hast discovered 1540-14 [thyself to another] than me, and art gone up; 5927-4 thou hast enlarged 7337-52 thy bed, 4904 and made 3772-4 thee [a covenant] with them; thou lovedst 157-1 their bed 4904 where 3027 thou sawest 2372-1 [it].

57:9 And thou wentest 7788-4 to the king 4428 with ointment, 8081 and didst increase 7235-55 thy perfumes, 7547 and didst send 7971-17 thy messengers 6735 far off, 7350 and didst debase 8213-55 [thyself even] unto hell. 7585

57:10 Thou art wearied 3021-1 in the greatness 7230 of thy way; 1870 [yet] saidst 559-1 thou not, There is no hope: 2976-12 thou hast found 4672-1 the life 2416 of thine hand; 3027 therefore thou wast not grieved. 2470-1

57:11 And of whom hast thou been afraid 1672-1 or feared, 3372-4 that thou hast lied, 3576-17 and hast not remembered 2142-1 me, nor laid 7760-1 [it] to thy heart? 3820 have not I held my peace 2814-56 even of old, 5769 and thou fearest 3372-4 me not?

57:12 I will declare 5046-55 thy righteousness, 6666 and thy works; 4639 for they shall not profit 3276-55 thee.

57:13 When thou criest, 2199-2 let thy companies 6899 deliver 5337-55 thee; but the wind 7307 shall carry them all away; 5375-4 vanity 1892 shall take 3947-4 [them]: but he that putteth his trust 2620-6 in me shall possess 5157-4 the land, 776 and shall inherit 3423-4 my holy 6944 mountain; 2022

57:14 And shall say, 559-1 Cast ye up, 5549-3 cast ye up, 5549-3 prepare 6437-16 the way, 1870 take up 7311-54 the stumblingblock 4383 out of the way 1870 of my people. 5971

57:15 For thus saith 559-1 the high 7311-6 and lofty 5375-12 One that inhabiteth 7931-6 eternity, 5703 whose name 8034 [is] Holy; 6918 I dwell 7931-4 in the high 4791 and holy 6918 [place], with him also [that is] of a contrite 1793 and humble 8217 spirit, 7307 to revive 2421-53 the spirit 7307 of the humble, 8217 and to revive 2421-53 the heart 3820 of the contrite ones. 1792-12

57:16 For I will not contend 7378-4 for ever, 5769 neither will I be always 5331 wroth: 7107-4 for the spirit 7307 should fail 5848-4 before 6440 me, and the souls 5397 [which] I have made. 6213-1

57:17 For the iniquity 5771 of his covetousness 1215 was I wroth, 7107-1 and smote 5221-55 him: I hid 5641-53 me, and was wroth, 7107-4 and he went on 3212-4 frowardly 7726 in the way 1870 of his heart. 3820

57:18 I have seen 7200-1 his ways, 1870 and will heal 7495-4 him: I will lead 5148-55 him also, and restore 7999-17 comforts 5150 unto him and to his mourners. 57

57:19 I create 1254-6 the fruit 5108 of the lips; 8193 Peace, 7965 peace 7965 to [him that is] far off, 7350 and to [him that is] near, 7138 saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 and I will heal 7495-1 him.

57:20 But the wicked 7563 [are] like the troubled 1644-12 sea, 3220 when it cannot 3808 3201-4 rest, 8252-53 whose waters 4325 cast up 1644-4 mire 7516 and dirt. 2916

57:21 [There is] no peace, 7965 saith 559-1 my God, 430 to the wicked. 7563

58:1 Cry 7121-3 aloud, 1627 spare 2820-4 not, lift up 7311-54 thy voice 6963 like a trumpet, 7782 and shew 5046-54 my people 5971 their transgression, 6588 and the house 1004 of Jacob 3290 their sins. 2403

58:2 Yet they seek 1875-4 me daily, 3117 3117 and delight 2654-4 to know 1847 my ways, 1870 as a nation 1471 that did 6213-1 righteousness, 6666 and forsook 5800-1 not the ordinance 4941 of their God: 430 they ask 7592-4 of me the ordinances 4941 of justice; 6664 they take delight 2654-4 in approaching 7132 to God. 430

58:3 Wherefore have we fasted, 6684-1 [say they], and thou seest 7200-1 not? [wherefore] have we afflicted 6031-14 our soul, 5315 and thou takest no knowledge? 3045-4 Behold, in the day 3117 of your fast 6685 ye find 4672-4 pleasure, 2656 and exact 5065-4 all your labours. 6092

58:4 Behold, ye fast 6684-4 for strife 7379 and debate, 4683 and to smite 5221-53 with the fist 106 of wickedness: 7562 ye shall not fast 6684-4 as [ye do this] day, 3117 to make your voice 6963 to be heard 8085-53 on high. 4791

58:5 Is it such a fast 6685 that I have chosen? 977-4 a day 3117 for a man 120 to afflict 6031-15 his soul? 5315 [is it] to bow down 3721-2 his head 7218 as a bulrush, 100 and to spread 3331-55 sackcloth 8242 and ashes 665 [under him]? wilt thou call 7121-4 this 2088 a fast, 6685 and an acceptable 7522 day 3117 to the LORD? 3068

58:6 [Is] not this the fast 6685 that I have chosen? 977-4 to loose 6605-15 the bands 2784 of wickedness, 7562 to undo 5425-53 the heavy 4133 burdens, 92 and to let the oppressed 7533-7 go 7971-15 free, 2670 and that ye break 5423-17 every yoke? 4133

58:7 [Is it] not to deal 6536-2 thy bread 3899 to the hungry, 7457 and that thou bring 935-55 the poor 6041 that are cast out 4788 to thy house? 1004 when thou seest 7200-4 the naked, 6174 that thou cover 3680-14 him; and that thou hide 5956-101 not thyself from thine own flesh? 1320

58:8 Then shall thy light 216 break forth 1234-11 as the morning, 7837 and thine health 724 shall spring forth 6779-4 speedily: 4120 and thy righteousness 6664 shall go 1980-1 before 6440 thee; the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 shall be thy rereward. 622-4

58:9 Then shalt thou call, 7121-4 and the LORD 3068 shall answer; 6030-4 thou shalt cry, 7768-17 and he shall say, 559-4 Here I [am]. If thou take away 5493-55 from the midst 8432 of thee the yoke, 4133 the putting forth 7971-2 of the finger, 676 and speaking 1696-15 vanity; 205

58:10 And [if] thou draw out 6329-55 thy soul 5315 to the hungry, 7457 and satisfy 7646-55 the afflicted 6031-12 soul; 5315 then shall thy light 216 rise 2224-1 in obscurity, 2822 and thy darkness 653 [be] as the noonday: 6672

58:11 And the LORD 3068 shall guide 5148-1 thee continually, 8548 and satisfy 7646-52 thy soul 5315 in drought, 6710 and make fat 2502-55 thy bones: 6106 and thou shalt be like a watered 7302 garden, 1588 and like a spring 4161 of water, 4325 whose waters 4325 fail 3576-17 not.

58:12 And [they that shall be] of thee shall build 1129-1 the old 5769 waste places: 2723 thou shalt raise up 6965-34 the foundations 4144 of many 1755 generations; 1755 and thou shalt be called, 7121-27 The repairer 1443-6 of the breach, 6556 The restorer 7725-35 of paths 5410 to dwell in. 3427-2

58:13 If thou turn away 7725-55 thy foot 7272 from the sabbath, 7676 [from] doing 6213-2 thy pleasure 2656 on my holy 6944 day; 3117 and call 7121-1 the sabbath 7676 a delight, 6027 the holy 6918 of the LORD, 3068 honourable; 3513-30 and shalt honour 3513-14 him, not doing 6213-2 thine own ways, 1870 nor finding 4672-2 thine own pleasure, 2656 nor speaking 1696-15 [thine own] words: 1697

58:14 Then shalt thou delight 6026-101 thyself in the LORD; 3068 and I will cause thee to ride 7392-52 upon the high places 1116 of the earth, 776 and feed 398-52 thee with the heritage 5159 of Jacob 3290 thy father: 1 for the mouth 6310 of the LORD 3068 hath spoken 1696-14 [it].

59:1 Behold, 2005 the LORD'S 3068 hand 3027 is not shortened, 7114-1 that it cannot save; 3467-53 neither his ear 241 heavy, 3513-1 that it cannot hear: 8085-2

59:2 But your iniquities 5771 have separated 914-56 between you 996 996 and your God, 430 and your sins 2403 have hid 5641-52 [his] face 6440 from you, that he will not hear. 8085-2

59:3 For your hands 3709 are defiled 1351-8 with blood, 1818 and your fingers 676 with iniquity; 5771 your lips 8193 have spoken 1696-14 lies, 8267 your tongue 3956 hath muttered 1897-4 perverseness. 5766

59:4 None calleth 7121-6 for justice, 6664 nor [any] pleadeth 8199-12 for truth: 530 they trust 982-2 in vanity, 8414 and speak 1696-15 lies; 7723 they conceive 2029-2 mischief, 5999 and bring forth 3205-53 iniquity. 205

59:5 They hatch 1234-14 cockatrice' 6848 eggs, 1000 and weave 707-4 the spider's 5908 web: 6980 he that eateth 398-6 of their eggs 1000 dieth, 4191-4 and that which is crushed 2116 breaketh out 1234-11 into a viper. 660

59:6 Their webs 6980 shall not become garments, 899 neither shall they cover 3680-101 themselves with their works: 4639 their works 4639 [are] works 4639 of iniquity, 205 and the act 6467 of violence 2555 [is] in their hands. 3709

59:7 Their feet 7272 run 7323-4 to evil, 7451 and they make haste 4116-17 to shed 8210-2 innocent 5355 blood: 1818 their thoughts 4284 [are] thoughts 4284 of iniquity; 205 wasting 7701 and destruction 7667 [are] in their paths. 4546

59:8 The way 1870 of peace 7965 they know 3045-1 not; and [there is] no judgment 4941 in their goings: 4570 they have made them crooked 6140-14 paths: 5410 whosoever goeth 1869-6 therein shall not know 3045-1 peace. 7965

59:9 Therefore is judgment 4941 far 7368-1 from us, neither doth justice 6666 overtake 5381-55 us: we wait 6960-17 for light, 216 but behold obscurity; 2822 for brightness, 5054 [but] we walk 1980-17 in darkness. 653

59:10 We grope 1659-17 for the wall 7023 like the blind, 5787 and we grope 1659-17 as if [we had] no eyes: 5869 we stumble 3782-1 at noonday 6672 as in the night; 5399 [we are] in desolate 820 places as dead 4191-5 [men].

59:11 We roar 1993-4 all like bears, 1677 and mourn 1897-4 sore 1897-2 like doves: 3123 we look 6960-17 for judgment, 4941 but [there is] none; for salvation, 3444 [but] it is far off 7368-1 from us.

59:12 For our transgressions 6588 are multiplied 7231-1 before thee, and our sins 2403 testify 6030-1 against us: for our transgressions 6588 [are] with us; and [as for] our iniquities, 5771 we know 3045-1 them;

59:13 In transgressing 6586-2 and lying 3584-15 against the LORD, 3068 and departing away 5253-2 from 310 our God, 430 speaking 1696-15 oppression 6233 and revolt, 5627 conceiving 2029-23 and uttering 1897-20 from the heart 3820 words 1697 of falsehood. 8267

59:14 And judgment 4941 is turned away 5253-90 backward, 268 and justice 6666 standeth 5975-4 afar off: 7350 for truth 571 is fallen 3782-1 in the street, 7339 and equity 5229 cannot 3808 3201-4 enter. 935-2

59:15 Yea, truth 571 faileth; 5737-12 and he [that] departeth 5493-1 from evil 7451 maketh himself a prey: 7997-114 and the LORD 3068 saw 7200-4 [it], and it displeased 3415-4 5869 him that [there was] no judgment. 4941

59:16 And he saw 7200-4 that [there was] no man, 376 and wondered 8074-113 that [there was] no intercessor: 6293-56 therefore his arm 2220 brought salvation 3467-55 unto him; and his righteousness, 6666 it sustained 5564-1 him.

59:17 For he put on 3847-4 righteousness 6666 as a breastplate, 8302 and an helmet 3553 of salvation 3444 upon his head; 7218 and he put on 3847-4 the garments 899 of vengeance 5359 [for] clothing, 8516 and was clad 5844-4 with zeal 7068 as a cloke. 4598

59:18 According to 5921 [their] deeds, 1578 accordingly 5921 he will repay, 7999-17 fury 2534 to his adversaries, 6862 recompence 1576 to his enemies; 341-6 to the islands 339 he will repay 7999-17 recompence. 1576

59:19 So shall they fear 3372-4 the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 from the west, 4628 and his glory 3519 from the rising 4217 of the sun. 8121 When the enemy 6862 shall come in 935-4 like a flood, 5104 the Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 shall lift up a standard 5127-31 against him.

59:20 And the Redeemer 1350-6 shall come 935-1 to Zion, 6726 and unto them that turn 7725-6 from transgression 6588 in Jacob, 3290 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

59:21 As for me, this [is] my covenant 1285 with them, saith 559-1 the LORD; 3068 My spirit 7307 that [is] upon thee, and my words 1697 which I have put 7760-1 in thy mouth, 6310 shall not depart 4185-4 out of thy mouth, 6310 nor out of the mouth 6310 of thy seed, 2233 nor out of the mouth 6310 of thy seed's 2233 seed, 2233 saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 from henceforth and for 5704 ever. 5769

60:1 Arise, 6965-3 shine; 215-3 for thy light 216 is come, 935-1 and the glory 3519 of the LORD 3068 is risen 2224-1 upon thee.

60:2 For, behold, the darkness 2822 shall cover 3680-17 the earth, 776 and gross darkness 6205 the people: 3816 but the LORD 3068 shall arise 2224-4 upon thee, and his glory 3519 shall be seen 7200-11 upon thee.

60:3 And the Gentiles 1471 shall come 1980-1 to thy light, 216 and kings 4428 to the brightness 5051 of thy rising. 2225

60:4 Lift up 5375-3 thine eyes 5869 round about, 5439 and see: 7200-3 all they gather themselves together, 6908-8 they come 935-1 to thee: thy sons 1121 shall come 935-4 from far, 7350 and thy daughters 1323 shall be nursed 539-11 at [thy] side. 6654

60:5 Then thou shalt see, 7200-4|3372-4 and flow together, 5102-1 and thine heart 3824 shall fear, 6342-1 and be enlarged; 7337-1 because the abundance 1995 of the sea 3220 shall be converted 2015-11 unto thee, the forces 2428 of the Gentiles 1471 shall come 935-4 unto thee.

60:6 The multitude 8229 of camels 1581 shall cover 3680-17 thee, the dromedaries 1070 of Midian 4080 and Ephah; 5891 all they from Sheba 7614 shall come: 935-4 they shall bring 5375-4 gold 2091 and incense; 3828 and they shall shew forth 1319-17 the praises 8416 of the LORD. 3068

60:7 All the flocks 6629 of Kedar 6938 shall be gathered together 6908-11 unto thee, the rams 352 of Nebaioth 5032 shall minister 8334-17 unto thee: they shall come up 5927-4 with acceptance 7522 on mine altar, 4196 and I will glorify 6286-17 the house 1004 of my glory. 8597

60:8 Who [are] these [that] fly 5774-4 as a cloud, 5645 and as the doves 3123 to their windows? 699

60:9 Surely the isles 339 shall wait 6960-17 for me, and the ships 591 of Tarshish 8659 first, 7223 to bring 935-53 thy sons 1121 from far, 7350 their silver 3701 and their gold 2091 with them, unto the name 8034 of the LORD 3068 thy God, 430 and to the Holy One 6918 of Israel, 3478 because he hath glorified 6286-14 thee.

60:10 And the sons 1121 of strangers 5236 shall build up 1129-1 thy walls, 2346 and their kings 4428 shall minister 8334-17 unto thee: for in my wrath 7110 I smote 5221-52 thee, but in my favour 7522 have I had mercy 7355-14 on thee.

60:11 Therefore thy gates 8179 shall be open 6605-14 continually; 8548 they shall not be shut 5462-11 day 3119 nor night; 3915 that [men] may bring 935-53 unto thee the forces 2428 of the Gentiles, 1471 and [that] their kings 4428 [may be] brought. 5090-7

60:12 For the nation 1471 and kingdom 4467 that will not serve 5647-4 thee shall perish; 6-4 yea, [those] nations 1471 shall be utterly 2717-2 wasted. 2717-4

60:13 The glory 3519 of Lebanon 3844 shall come 935-4 unto thee, the fir tree, 1265 the pine tree, 8410 and the box 8391 together, 3162 to beautify 6286-15 the place 4725 of my sanctuary; 4720 and I will make the place 4725 of my feet 7272 glorious. 3513-17

60:14 The sons 1121 also of them that afflicted 6031-18 thee shall come 1980-1 bending 7817-2 unto thee; and all they that despised 5006-18 thee shall bow themselves down 7812-98 at the soles 3709 of thy feet; 7272 and they shall call 7121-1 thee, The city 5892 of the LORD, 3068 The Zion 6726 of the Holy One 6918 of Israel. 3478

60:15 Whereas 8478 thou hast been forsaken 5800-7 and hated, 8130-7 so that no man went through 5674-6 [thee], I will make 7760-1 thee an eternal 5769 excellency, 1347 a joy 4885 of many 1755 generations. 1755

60:16 Thou shalt also suck 3243-1 the milk 2461 of the Gentiles, 1471 and shalt suck 3243-4 the breast 7699 of kings: 4428 and thou shalt know 3045-1 that I the LORD 3068 [am] thy Saviour 3467-56 and thy Redeemer, 1350-6 the mighty 46 One of Jacob. 3290

60:17 For brass 5178 I will bring 935-55 gold, 2091 and for iron 1270 I will bring 935-55 silver, 3701 and for wood 6086 brass, 5178 and for stones 68 iron: 1270 I will also make 7760-1 thy officers 6486 peace, 7965 and thine exactors 5065-6 righteousness. 6666

60:18 Violence 2555 shall no more be heard 8085-11 in thy land, 776 wasting 7701 nor destruction 7667 within thy borders; 1366 but thou shalt call 7121-1 thy walls 2346 Salvation, 3444 and thy gates 8179 Praise. 8416

60:19 The sun 8121 shall be no more thy light 216 by day; 3119 neither for brightness 5051 shall the moon 3394 give light 215-55 unto thee: but the LORD 3068 shall be unto thee an everlasting 5769 light, 216 and thy God 430 thy glory. 8597

60:20 Thy sun 8121 shall no more go down; 935-4 neither shall thy moon 3391 withdraw 622-11 itself: for the LORD 3068 shall be thine everlasting 5769 light, 216 and the days 3117 of thy mourning 60 shall be ended. 7999-1

60:21 Thy people 5971 also [shall be] all righteous: 6662 they shall inherit 3423-4 the land 776 for ever, 5769 the branch 5342 of my planting, 4302 the work 4639 of my hands, 3027 that I may be glorified. 6286-99

60:22 A little one 6996 shall become a thousand, 505 and a small one 6810 a strong 6099 nation: 1471 I the LORD 3068 will hasten 2363-55 it in his time. 6256

61:1 The Spirit 7307 of the Lord 136 GOD 3069 [is] upon me; because the LORD 3068 hath anointed 4886-1 me to preach good tidings 1319-15 unto the meek; 6035 he hath sent 7971-1 me to bind up 2280-2 the brokenhearted, 7665-12 3820 to proclaim 7121-2 liberty 1865 to the captives, 7617-7 and the opening of the prison 6495 to [them that are] bound; 631-7

61:2 To proclaim 7121-2 the acceptable 7522 year 8141 of the LORD, 3068 and the day 3117 of vengeance 5359 of our God; 430 to comfort 5162-15 all that mourn; 57

61:3 To appoint 7760-2 unto them that mourn 57 in Zion, 6726 to give 5414-2 unto them beauty 6287 for ashes, 665 the oil 8081 of joy 8342 for mourning, 60 the garment 4594 of praise 8416 for the spirit 7307 of heaviness; 3544 that they might be called 7121-27 trees 352 of righteousness, 6664 the planting 4302 of the LORD, 3068 that he might be glorified. 6286-99

61:4 And they shall build 1129-1 the old 5769 wastes, 2723 they shall raise up 6965-34 the former 7223 desolations, 8074-6 and they shall repair 2318-14 the waste 2721 cities, 5892 the desolations 8074-6 of many 1755 generations. 1755

61:5 And strangers 2114-5 shall stand 5975-1 and feed 7462-1 your flocks, 6629 and the sons 1121 of the alien 5236 [shall be] your plowmen 406 and your vinedressers. 3755

61:6 But ye shall be named 7121-11 the Priests 3548 of the LORD: 3068 [men] shall call 559-11 you the Ministers 8334-18 of our God: 430 ye shall eat 398-4 the riches 2428 of the Gentiles, 1471 and in their glory 3519 shall ye boast 3235-101 yourselves.

61:7 For your shame 1322 [ye shall have] double; 4932 and [for] confusion 3639 they shall rejoice 7442-4 in their portion: 2506 therefore in their land 776 they shall possess 3423-4 the double: 4932 everlasting 5769 joy 8057 shall be unto them.

61:8 For I the LORD 3068 love 157-6 judgment, 4941 I hate 8130-6 robbery 1498 for burnt offering; 5930 and I will direct 5414-1 their work 6468 in truth, 571 and I will make 3772-4 an everlasting 5769 covenant 1285 with them.

61:9 And their seed 2233 shall be known 3045-8 among the Gentiles, 1471 and their offspring 6631 among 8432 the people: 5971 all that see 7200-6 them shall acknowledge 5234-55 them, that they [are] the seed 2233 [which] the LORD 3068 hath blessed. 1288-14

61:10 I will greatly 7797-2 rejoice 7797-4 in the LORD, 3068 my soul 5315 shall be joyful 1523-4 in my God; 430 for he hath clothed 3847-52 me with the garments 899 of salvation, 3468 he hath covered 3271-1 me with the robe 4598 of righteousness, 6666 as a bridegroom 2860 decketh 3547-17 [himself] with ornaments, 6287 and as a bride 3618 adorneth 5710-4 [herself] with her jewels. 3627

61:11 For as the earth 776 bringeth forth 3318-55 her bud, 6780 and as the garden 1593 causeth the things that are sown 2221 in it to spring forth; 6779-55 so the Lord 136 GOD 3069 will cause righteousness 6666 and praise 8416 to spring forth 6779-55 before all the nations. 1471

62:1 For Zion's 6726 sake will I not 3808 hold my peace, 2814-4 and for Jerusalem's 3389 sake I will not 3808 rest, 8252-4 until the righteousness 6664 thereof go forth 3318-4 as brightness, 5051 and the salvation 3444 thereof as a lamp 3940 [that] burneth. 1197-4

62:2 And the Gentiles 1471 shall see 7200-1 thy righteousness, 6664 and all kings 4428 thy glory: 3519 and thou shalt be called 7121-27 by a new 2319 name, 8034 which the mouth 6310 of the LORD 3068 shall name. 5344-4

62:3 Thou shalt also be a crown 5850 of glory 8597 in the hand 3027 of the LORD, 3068 and a royal 4410 diadem 6797 in the hand 3709 of thy God. 430

62:4 Thou shalt no more be termed 559-11 Forsaken; 5800-7 neither shall thy land 776 any more be termed 559-11 Desolate: 8077 but thou shalt be called 7121-11 Hephzibah, 2656|2657 and thy land 776 Beulah: 1166-7 for the LORD 3068 delighteth 2654-1 in thee, and thy land 776 shall be married. 1166-11

62:5 For [as] a young man 970 marrieth 1166-4 a virgin, 1330 [so] shall thy sons 1121 marry 1166-4 thee: and [as] the bridegroom 2860 rejoiceth 4885 over the bride, 3618 [so] shall thy God 430 rejoice 7797-4 over thee.

62:6 I have set 6485-52 watchmen 8104-6 upon thy walls, 2346 O Jerusalem, 3389 [which] shall never 3808 8548 hold their peace 2814-4 day 3117 nor night: 3915 ye that make mention 2142-56 of the LORD, 3068 keep not silence, 1824

62:7 And give 5414-4 him no rest, 1824 till he establish, 3559-34 and till he make 7760-4 Jerusalem 3389 a praise 8416 in the earth. 776

62:8 The LORD 3068 hath sworn 7650-8 by his right hand, 3225 and by the arm 2220 of his strength, 5797 Surely I will no more 518 give 5414-4 thy corn 1715 [to be] meat 3978 for thine enemies; 341-6 and the sons 1121 of the stranger 5236 shall not drink 8354-4 thy wine, 8492 for the which thou hast laboured: 3021-1

62:9 But they that have gathered 622-18 it shall eat 398-4 it, and praise 1984-14 the LORD; 3068 and they that have brought it together 6908-18 shall drink 8354-4 it in the courts 2691 of my holiness. 6944

62:10 Go through, 5674-3 go through 5674-3 the gates; 8179 prepare 6437-16 ye the way 1870 of the people; 5971 cast up, 5549-3 cast up 5549-3 the highway; 4546 gather out 5619-16 the stones; 68 lift up 7311-54 a standard 5251 for the people. 5971

62:11 Behold, the LORD 3068 hath proclaimed 8085-52 unto the end 7097 of the world, 776 Say 559-3 ye to the daughter 1323 of Zion, 6726 Behold, thy salvation 3468 cometh; 935-6 behold, his reward 7939 [is] with him, and his work 6468 before 6440 him.

62:12 And they shall call 7121-1 them, The holy 6944 people, 5971 The redeemed 1350-7 of the LORD: 3068 and thou shalt be called, 7121-11 Sought out, 1875-7 A city 5892 not forsaken. 5800-12

63:1 Who [is] this that cometh 935-6 from Edom, 123 with dyed 2556-7 garments 899 from Bozrah? 1224 this [that is] glorious 1921-7 in his apparel, 3830 travelling 6808-6 in the greatness 7230 of his strength? 3581 I that speak 1696-18 in righteousness, 6666 mighty 7227 to save. 3467-53

63:2 Wherefore [art thou] red 122 in thine apparel, 3830 and thy garments 899 like him that treadeth 1869-6 in the winefat? 1660

63:3 I have trodden 1869-1 the winepress 6333 alone; and of the people 5971 [there was] none 376 with me: for I will tread 1869-4 them in mine anger, 639 and trample 7429-4 them in my fury; 2534 and their blood 5332 shall be sprinkled 5137-4 upon my garments, 899 and I will stain 1351-52 all my raiment. 4403

63:4 For the day 3117 of vengeance 5359 [is] in mine heart, 3820 and the year 8141 of my redeemed 1350-7 is come. 935-1

63:5 And I looked, 5027-55 and [there was] none to help; 5826-6 and I wondered 8074-113 that [there was] none to uphold: 5564-6 therefore mine own arm 2220 brought salvation 3467-55 unto me; and my fury, 2534 it upheld 5564-1 me.

63:6 And I will tread down 947-4 the people 5971 in mine anger, 639 and make them drunk 7937-17 in my fury, 2534 and I will bring down 3381-55 their strength 5332 to the earth. 776

63:7 I will mention 2142-55 the lovingkindnesses 2617 of the LORD, 3068 [and] the praises 8416 of the LORD, 3068 according to all that the LORD 3068 hath bestowed 1580-1 on us, and the great 7227 goodness 2898 toward the house 1004 of Israel, 3478 which he hath bestowed 1580-1 on them according to his mercies, 7356 and according to the multitude 7230 of his lovingkindnesses. 2617

63:8 For he said, 559-4 Surely they [are] my people, 5971 children 1121 [that] will not lie: 8266-17 so he was their Saviour. 3467-56

63:9 In all their affliction 6869 he was afflicted, 6862 and the angel 4397 of his presence 6440 saved 3467-52 them: in his love 160 and in his pity 2551 he redeemed 1350-1 them; and he bare 5190-17 them, and carried 5375-17 them all the days 3117 of old. 5769

63:10 But they rebelled, 4784-1 and vexed 6087-14 his holy 6944 Spirit: 7307 therefore he was turned 2015-11 to be their enemy, 341-6 [and] he fought 3898-8 against them.

63:11 Then he remembered 2142-4 the days 3117 of old, 5769 Moses, 4872 [and] his people, 5971 [saying], Where [is] he that brought them up 5927-56 out of the sea 3220 with the shepherd 7462-6 of his flock? 6629 where [is] he that put 7760-6 his holy 6944 Spirit 7307 within 7130 him?

63:12 That led 3212-56 [them] by the right hand 3225 of Moses 4872 with his glorious 8597 arm, 2220 dividing 1234-6 the water 4325 before 6440 them, to make 6213-2 himself an everlasting 5769 name? 8034

63:13 That led 3212-56 them through the deep, 8415 as an horse 5483 in the wilderness, 4057 [that] they should not stumble? 3782-11

63:14 As a beast 929 goeth down 3381-4 into the valley, 1237 the Spirit 7307 of the LORD 3068 caused him to rest: 5117-55 so didst thou lead 5090-14 thy people, 5971 to make 6213-2 thyself a glorious 8597 name. 8034

63:15 Look 5027-54 down from heaven, 8064 and behold 7200-3 from the habitation 2073 of thy holiness 6944 and of thy glory: 8597 where [is] thy zeal 7068 and thy strength, 1369 the sounding 1995 of thy bowels 4578 and of thy mercies 7356 toward me? are they restrained? 662-98

63:16 Doubtless 3588 thou [art] our father, 1 though Abraham 85 be ignorant 3808 3045-1 of us, and Israel 3478 acknowledge 5234-55 us not: thou, O LORD, 3068 [art] our father, 1 our redeemer; 1350-6 thy name 8034 [is] from everlasting. 5769

63:17 O LORD, 3068 why hast thou made us to err 8582-55 from thy ways, 1870 [and] hardened 7188-55 our heart 3820 from thy fear? 3374 Return 7725-3 for thy servants' 5650 sake, the tribes 7626 of thine inheritance. 5159

63:18 The people 5971 of thy holiness 6944 have possessed 3423-1 [it] but a little while: 4705 our adversaries 6862 have trodden down 947-31 thy sanctuary. 4720

63:19 We are [thine]: thou never 5769 3808 barest rule 4910-1 over them; they were not called 7121-8 by thy name. 8034

64:1 Oh that 3863 thou wouldest rend 7167-1 the heavens, 8064 that thou wouldest come down, 3381-1 that the mountains 2022 might flow down 2151-8 at thy presence, 6440

64:2 As [when] the melting 2003 fire 784 burneth, 6919-2 the fire 784 causeth the waters 4325 to boil, 1158-4 to make thy name 8034 known 3045-53 to thine adversaries, 6862 [that] the nations 1471 may tremble 7264-4 at thy presence! 6440

64:3 When thou didst 6213-2 terrible things 3372-12 [which] we looked 6960-17 not for, thou camest down, 3381-1 the mountains 2022 flowed down 2151-8 at thy presence. 6440

64:4 For since the beginning of the world 5769 [men] have not heard, 8085-1 nor perceived by the ear, 238-52 neither hath the eye 5869 seen, 7200-1 O God, 430 beside 2108 thee, [what] he hath prepared 6213-4 for him that waiteth 2442-18 for him.

64:5 Thou meetest 6293-1 him that rejoiceth 7797-5 and worketh 6213-6 righteousness, 6664 [those that] remember 2142-4 thee in thy ways: 1870 behold, thou art wroth; 7107-1 for we have sinned: 2398-4 in those is continuance, 5769 and we shall be saved. 3467-11

64:6 But we are all as an unclean 2931 [thing], and all our righteousnesses 6666 [are] as filthy 5708 rags; 899 and we all do fade 5034-4|1101-55-q as a leaf; 5929 and our iniquities, 5771 like the wind, 7307 have taken us away. 5375-4

64:7 And [there is] none that calleth 7121-6 upon thy name, 8034 that stirreth up 5782-114 himself to take hold 2388-53 of thee: for thou hast hid 5641-52 thy face 6440 from us, and hast consumed 4127-4 us, because 3027 of our iniquities. 5771

64:8 But now, O LORD, 3068 thou [art] our father; 1 we [are] the clay, 2563 and thou our potter; 3335-6 and we all [are] the work 4639 of thy hand. 3027

64:9 Be not wroth 7107-4 very sore, 3966 O LORD, 3068 neither remember 2142-4 iniquity 5771 for ever: 5703 behold, see, 5027-54 we beseech thee, we [are] all thy people. 5971

64:10 Thy holy 6944 cities 5892 are a wilderness, 4057 Zion 6726 is a wilderness, 4057 Jerusalem 3389 a desolation. 8077

64:11 Our holy 6944 and our beautiful 8597 house, 1004 where our fathers 1 praised 1984-14 thee, is burned 8316 up with fire: 784 and all our pleasant things 4261 are laid waste. 2723

64:12 Wilt thou refrain 662-101 thyself for these [things], O LORD? 3068 wilt thou hold thy peace, 2814-4 and afflict 6031-17 us very sore? 3966

65:1 I am sought 1875-8 of [them that] asked 7592-1 not 3808 [for me]; I am found 4672-8 of [them that] sought 1245-14 me not: 3808 I said, 559-1 Behold me, behold me, unto a nation 1471 [that] was not called 7121-27 by my name. 8034

65:2 I have spread out 6566-14 my hands 3027 all the day 3117 unto a rebellious 5637-6 people, 5971 which walketh 1980-6 in a way 1870 [that was] not good, 2896 after 310 their own thoughts; 4284

65:3 A people 5971 that provoketh me to anger 3707-56 continually 8548 to my face; 6440 that sacrificeth 2076-6 in gardens, 1593 and burneth incense 6999-18 upon altars of brick; 3843

65:4 Which remain 3427-6 among the graves, 6913 and lodge 3885-4 in the monuments, 5341-7 which eat 398-6 swine's 2386 flesh, 1320 and broth 4839|6564-k of abominable 6292 [things is in] their vessels; 3627

65:5 Which say, 559-6 Stand 7126-3 by thyself, come not near 5066-4 to me; for I am holier 6942-1 than thou. These [are] a smoke 6227 in my nose, 639 a fire 784 that burneth 3344-6 all the day. 3117

65:6 Behold, [it is] written 3789-7 before 6440 me: I will not keep silence, 2814-4 but will recompense, 7999-14 even recompense 7999-14 into their bosom, 2436

65:7 Your iniquities, 5771 and the iniquities 5771 of your fathers 1 together, 3162 saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 which have burned incense 6999-14 upon the mountains, 2022 and blasphemed 2778-14 me upon the hills: 1389 therefore will I measure 4058-1 their former 7223 work 6468 into their bosom. 2436

65:8 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 As the new wine 8492 is found 4672-11 in the cluster, 811 and [one] saith, 559-1 Destroy 7843-55 it not; for a blessing 1293 [is] in it: so will I do 6213-4 for my servants' 5650 sakes, that I may not destroy 7843-53 them all.

65:9 And I will bring forth 3318-52 a seed 2233 out of Jacob, 3290 and out of Judah 3063 an inheritor 3423-6 of my mountains: 2022 and mine elect 972 shall inherit 3423-1 it, and my servants 5650 shall dwell 7931-4 there.

65:10 And Sharon 8289 shall be a fold 5116 of flocks, 6629 and the valley 6010 of Achor 5911 a place for the herds 1241 to lie down in, 7258 for my people 5971 that have sought 1875-1 me.

65:11 But ye [are] they that forsake 5800-6 the LORD, 3068 that forget 7913 my holy 6944 mountain, 2022 that prepare 6186-6 a table 7979 for that troop, 1409|1408 and that furnish 4390-18 the drink offering 4469 unto that number. 4507

65:12 Therefore will I number 4487-1 you to the sword, 2719 and ye shall all bow down 3766-4 to the slaughter: 2874 because when I called, 7121-1 ye did not answer; 6030-1 when I spake, 1696-14 ye did not hear; 8085-1 but did 6213-4 evil 7451 before mine eyes, 5869 and did choose 977-1 [that] wherein I delighted 2654-1 not.

65:13 Therefore thus saith 559-1 the Lord 136 GOD, 3069 Behold, my servants 5650 shall eat, 398-4 but ye shall be hungry: 7456-4 behold, my servants 5650 shall drink, 8354-4 but ye shall be thirsty: 6770-4 behold, my servants 5650 shall rejoice, 8055-4 but ye shall be ashamed: 954-4

65:14 Behold, my servants 5650 shall sing 7442-4 for joy 2898 of heart, 3820 but ye shall cry 6817-4 for sorrow 3511 of heart, 3820 and shall howl 3213-55 for vexation 7667 of spirit. 7307

65:15 And ye shall leave 3240-52 your name 8034 for a curse 7621 unto my chosen: 972 for the Lord 136 GOD 3069 shall slay 4191-52 thee, and call 7121-4 his servants 5650 by another 312 name: 8034

65:16 That he who blesseth 1288-102 himself in the earth 776 shall bless 1288-101 himself in the God 430 of truth; 543 and he that sweareth 7650-12 in the earth 776 shall swear 7650-11 by the God 430 of truth; 543 because the former 7223 troubles 6869 are forgotten, 7911-8 and because they are hid 5641-8 from mine eyes. 5869

65:17 For, behold, I create 1254-6 new 2319 heavens 8064 and a new 2319 earth: 776 and the former 7223 shall not be remembered, 2142-11 nor come 5927-4 into mind. 3820

65:18 But be ye glad 7797-3 and rejoice 1523-3 for ever 5703 [in that] which I create: 1254-6 for, behold, I create 1254-6 Jerusalem 3389 a rejoicing, 1525 and her people 5971 a joy. 4885

65:19 And I will rejoice 1523-1 in Jerusalem, 3389 and joy 7797-1 in my people: 5971 and the voice 6963 of weeping 1065 shall be no more heard 8085-11 in her, nor the voice 6963 of crying. 2201

65:20 There shall be no more thence an infant 5764 of days, 3117 nor an old man 2205 that hath not filled 4390-17 his days: 3117 for the child 5288 shall die 4191-4 an hundred 3967 years 8141 old; 1121 but the sinner 2398-6 [being] an hundred 3967 years 8141 old 1121 shall be accursed. 7043-29

65:21 And they shall build 1129-1 houses, 1004 and inhabit 3427-1 [them]; and they shall plant 5193-1 vineyards, 3754 and eat 398-1 the fruit 6529 of them.

65:22 They shall not build, 1129-4 and another 312 inhabit; 3427-4 they shall not plant, 5193-4 and another 312 eat: 398-4 for as the days 3117 of a tree 6086 [are] the days 3117 of my people, 5971 and mine elect 972 shall long enjoy 1086-17 the work 4639 of their hands. 3027

65:23 They shall not labour 3021-4 in vain, 7385 nor bring forth 3205-4 for trouble; 928 for they [are] the seed 2233 of the blessed 1288-7 of the LORD, 3068 and their offspring 6631 with them.

65:24 And it shall come to pass, that before they call, 7121-4 I will answer; 6030-4 and while they are yet speaking, 1696-18 I will hear. 8085-4

65:25 The wolf 2061 and the lamb 2924 shall feed 7462-4 together, 259 and the lion 738 shall eat 398-4 straw 8401 like the bullock: 1241 and dust 6083 [shall be] the serpent's 5175 meat. 3899 They shall not hurt 7489-55 nor destroy 7843-55 in all my holy 6944 mountain, 2022 saith 559-1 the LORD. 3068

66:1 Thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 The heaven 8064 [is] my throne, 3678 and the earth 776 [is] my footstool: 7272 1916 where [is] the house 1004 that ye build 1129-4 unto me? and where [is] the place 4725 of my rest? 4496

66:2 For all those [things] hath mine hand 3027 made, 6213-1 and all those [things] have been, saith 5002-7 the LORD: 3068 but to this [man] will I look, 5027-55 [even] to [him that is] poor 6041 and of a contrite 5223 spirit, 7307 and trembleth 2730 at my word. 1697

66:3 He that killeth 7819-6 an ox 7794 [is as if] he slew 5221-56 a man; 376 he that sacrificeth 2076-6 a lamb, 7716 [as if] he cut off a dog's 3611 neck; 6202-6 he that offereth 5927-56 an oblation, 4503 [as if he offered] swine's 2386 blood; 1818 he that burneth 2142-56 incense, 3828 [as if] he blessed 1288-18 an idol. 205 Yea, they have chosen 977-1 their own ways, 1870 and their soul 5315 delighteth 2654-1 in their abominations. 8251

66:4 I also will choose 977-4 their delusions, 8586 and will bring 935-55 their fears 4035 upon them; because when I called, 7121-1 none did answer; 6030-6 when I spake, 1696-14 they did not hear: 8085-1 but they did 6213-4 evil 7451 before mine eyes, 5869 and chose 977-1 [that] in which I delighted 2654-1 not.

66:5 Hear 8085-3 the word 1697 of the LORD, 3068 ye that tremble 2730 at his word; 1697 Your brethren 251 that hated 8130-6 you, that cast you out 5077-18 for my name's 8034 sake, said, 559-1 Let the LORD 3068 be glorified: 3513-4 but he shall appear 7200-12 to your joy, 8057 and they shall be ashamed. 954-4

66:6 A voice 6963 of noise 7588 from the city, 5892 a voice 6963 from the temple, 1964 a voice 6963 of the LORD 3068 that rendereth 7999-18 recompence 1576 to his enemies. 341-6

66:7 Before she travailed, 2342-4 she brought forth; 3205-1 before her pain 2256 came, 935-4 she was delivered 4422-52 of a man child. 2145

66:8 Who hath heard 8085-1 such a thing? who hath seen 7200-1 such things? Shall the earth 776 be made to bring forth 2342-93 in one 259 day? 3117 [or] shall a nation 1471 be born 3205-11 at once? 6471 for as soon as 1571 Zion 6726 travailed, 2342-1 she brought forth 3205-1 her children. 1121

66:9 Shall I 589 bring to the birth, 7665-55 and not cause to bring forth? 3205-55 saith 559-4 the LORD: 3068 shall I cause to bring forth, 3205-56 and shut 6113-1 [the womb]? saith 559-1 thy God. 430

66:10 Rejoice 8055-3 ye with Jerusalem, 3389 and be glad 1523-3 with her, all ye that love 157-6 her: rejoice 7797-3 for joy 4885 with her, all ye that mourn 56-102 for her:

66:11 That ye may suck, 3243-4 and be satisfied 7646-1 with the breasts 7699 of her consolations; 8575 that ye may milk out, 4711-4 and be delighted 6026-98 with the abundance 2123 of her glory. 3519

66:12 For thus saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 Behold, I will extend 5186-6 peace 7965 to her like a river, 5104 and the glory 3519 of the Gentiles 1471 like a flowing 7857-6 stream: 5158 then shall ye suck, 3243-1 ye shall be borne 5375-11 upon [her] sides, 6654 and be dandled 8173-51 upon [her] knees. 1290

66:13 As one 376 whom his mother 517 comforteth, 5162-17 so will I comfort 5162-17 you; and ye shall be comforted 5162-29 in Jerusalem. 3389

66:14 And when ye see 7200-1 [this], your heart 3820 shall rejoice, 7797-1 and your bones 6106 shall flourish 6524-4 like an herb: 1877 and the hand 3027 of the LORD 3068 shall be known 3045-8 toward his servants, 5650 and [his] indignation 2194-1 toward his enemies. 341-6

66:15 For, behold, the LORD 3068 will come 935-4 with fire, 784 and with his chariots 4818 like a whirlwind, 5492 to render 7725-53 his anger 639 with fury, 2534 and his rebuke 1606 with flames 3851 of fire. 784

66:16 For by fire 784 and by his sword 2719 will the LORD 3068 plead 8199-12 with all flesh: 1320 and the slain 2491 of the LORD 3068 shall be many. 7231-1

66:17 They that sanctify 6942-102 themselves, and purify 2891-102 themselves in the gardens 1593 behind 310 one 259 [tree] in the midst, 8432 eating 398-6 swine's 2386 flesh, 1320 and the abomination, 8263 and the mouse, 5909 shall be consumed 5486-4 together, 3162 saith 5002-7 the LORD. 3068

66:18 For I [know] their works 4639 and their thoughts: 4284 it shall come, 935-6 that I will gather 6908-15 all nations 1471 and tongues; 3956 and they shall come, 935-1 and see 7200-1 my glory. 3519

66:19 And I will set 7760-1 a sign 226 among them, and I will send 7971-14 those that escape 6412 of them unto the nations, 1471 [to] Tarshish, 8659 Pul, 6322 and Lud, 3865 that draw 4900-6 the bow, 7198 [to] Tubal, 8422 and Javan, 3120 [to] the isles 339 afar off, 7350 that have not heard 8085-1 my fame, 8088 neither have seen 7200-1 my glory; 3519 and they shall declare 5046-52 my glory 3519 among the Gentiles. 1471

66:20 And they shall bring 935-52 all your brethren 251 [for] an offering 4503 unto the LORD 3068 out of all nations 1471 upon horses, 5483 and in chariots, 7393 and in litters, 6632 and upon mules, 6505 and upon swift beasts, 3753 to my holy 6944 mountain 2022 Jerusalem, 3389 saith 559-1 the LORD, 3068 as the children 1121 of Israel 3478 bring 935-55 an offering 4503 in a clean 2889 vessel 3627 into the house 1004 of the LORD. 3068

66:21 And I will also take 3947-4 of them for priests 3548 [and] for Levites, 3881 saith 559-1 the LORD. 3068

66:22 For as the new 2319 heavens 8064 and the new 2319 earth, 776 which I will make, 6213-6 shall remain 5975-6 before 6440 me, saith 5002-7 the LORD, 3068 so shall your seed 2233 and your name 8034 remain. 5975-4

66:23 And it shall come to pass, [that] from 1767 one new moon 2320 to another, 2320 and from 1767 one sabbath 7676 to another, 7676 shall all flesh 1320 come 935-4 to worship 7812-99 before 6440 me, saith 559-1 the LORD. 3068

66:24 And they shall go forth, 3318-1 and look 7200-1 upon the carcases 6297 of the men 582 that have transgressed 6586-6 against me: for their worm 8438 shall not die, 4191-4 neither shall their fire 784 be quenched; 3518-4 and they shall be an abhorring 1860 unto all flesh. 1320
