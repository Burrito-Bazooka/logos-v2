1:1 The beginning 746 of the gospel 2098 of Jesus 2424 Christ 5547, the Son 5207 of God 2316; 

1:2 As 5613 it is written 1125 5769 in 1722 the prophets 4396, Behold 2400 5628, I 1473 send 649 5719 my 3450 messenger 32 before 4253 thy 4675 face 4383, which 3739 shall prepare 2680 5692 thy 4675 way 3598 before 1715 thee 4675. 

1:3 The voice 5456 of one crying 994 5723 in 1722 the wilderness 2048, Prepare ye 2090 5657 the way 3598 of the Lord 2962, make 4160 5720 his 846 paths 5147 straight 2117. 

1:4 John 2491 did 1096 5633 baptize 907 5723 in 1722 the wilderness 2048, and 2532 preach 2784 5723 the baptism 908 of repentance 3341 for 1519 the remission 859 of sins 266. 

1:5 And 2532 there went out 1607 5711 unto 4314 him 846 all 3956 the land 5561 of Judaea 2453 2449, and 2532 they of Jerusalem 2415, and 2532 were 907 0 all 3956 baptized 907 5712 of 5259 him 846 in 1722 the river 4215 of Jordan 2446, confessing 1843 5734 their 848 sins 266. 

1:6 And 1161 John 2491 was 2258 5713 clothed 1746 5765 with camel's 2574 hair 2359, and 2532 with a girdle 2223 of a skin 1193 about 4012 his 848 loins 3751; and 2532 he did eat 2068 5723 locusts 200 and 2532 wild 66 honey 3192; 

1:7 And 2532 preached 2784 5707, saying 3004 5723, There cometh 2064 5736 one mightier than 2478 I 3450 after 3694 me 3450, the latchet 2438 of whose 3739 shoes 846 5266 I am 1510 5748 not 3756 worthy 2425 to stoop down 2955 5660 and unloose 3089 5658. 

1:8 I 1473 indeed 3303 have baptized 907 5656 you 5209 with 1722 water 5204: but 1161 he shall baptize 907 5692 you 5209 with 1722 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151. 

1:9 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633 in 1722 those 1565 days 2250, that Jesus 2424 came 2064 5627 from 575 Nazareth 3478 of Galilee 1056, and 2532 was baptized 907 5681 of 5259 John 2491 in 1519 Jordan 2446. 

1:10 And 2532 straightway 2112 coming up 305 5723 out of 575 the water 5204, he saw 1492 5627 the heavens 3772 opened 4977 5746, and 2532 the Spirit 4151 like 5616 a dove 4058 descending 2597 5723 upon 1909 him 846: 

1:11 And 2532 there came 1096 5633 a voice 5456 from 1537 heaven 3772, [saying], Thou 4771 art 1488 5748 my 3450 beloved 27 Son 5207, in 1722 whom 3739 I am well pleased 2106 5656. 

1:12 And 2532 immediately 2117 the Spirit 4151 driveth 1544 5719 him 846 into 1519 the wilderness 2048. 

1:13 And 2532 he was 2258 5713 there 1563 in 1722 the wilderness 2048 forty 5062 days 2250, tempted 3985 5746 of 5259 Satan 4567; and 2532 was 2258 5713 with 3326 the wild beasts 2342; and 2532 the angels 32 ministered 1247 5707 unto him 846. 

1:14 Now 1161 after 3326 that John 2491 was put in prison 3860 5683, Jesus 2424 came 2064 5627 into 1519 Galilee 1056, preaching 2784 5723 the gospel 2098 of the kingdom 932 of God 2316, 

1:15 And 2532 saying 3004 5723, 3754 The time 2540 is fulfilled 4137 5769, and 2532 the kingdom 932 of God 2316 is at hand 1448 5758: repent ye 3340 5720, and 2532 believe 4100 5720 1722 the gospel 2098. 

1:16 Now 1161 as he walked 4043 5723 by 3844 the sea 2281 of Galilee 1056, he saw 1492 5627 Simon 4613 and 2532 Andrew 406 his 846 brother 80 casting 906 5723 a net 293 into 1722 the sea 2281: for 1063 they were 2258 5713 fishers 231. 

1:17 And 2532 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Come ye 1205 5773 after 3694 me 3450, and 2532 I will make 4160 5692 you 5209 to become 1096 5635 fishers 231 of men 444. 

1:18 And 2532 straightway 2112 they forsook 863 5631 their 848 nets 1350, and followed 190 5656 him 846. 

1:19 And 2532 when he had gone 4260 0 a little 3641 further 4260 5631 thence 1564, he saw 1492 5627 James 2385 the [son] 3588 of Zebedee 2199, and 2532 John 2491 his 846 brother 80, who 846 also 2532 were in 1722 the ship 4143 mending 2675 5723 their nets 1350. 

1:20 And 2532 straightway 2112 he called 2564 5656 them 846: and 2532 they left 863 5631 their 848 father 3962 Zebedee 2199 in 1722 the ship 4143 with 3326 the hired servants 3411, and went 565 5627 after 3694 him 846. 

1:21 And 2532 they went 1531 5736 into 1519 Capernaum 2584; and 2532 straightway 2112 on the sabbath day 4521 he entered 1525 5631 into 1519 the synagogue 4864, and taught 1321 5707. 

1:22 And 2532 they were astonished 1605 5712 at 1909 his 846 doctrine 1322: for 1063 he taught 1321 5723 2258 5713 them 846 as 5613 one that had 2192 5723 authority 1849, and 2532 not 3756 as 5613 the scribes 1122. 

1:23 And 2532 there was 2258 5713 in 1722 their 846 synagogue 4864 a man 444 with 1722 an unclean 169 spirit 4151; and 2532 he cried out 349 5656, 

1:24 Saying 3004 5723, Let [us] alone 1436; what 5101 have we 2254 to do 2532 with thee 4671, thou Jesus 2424 of Nazareth 3479? art thou come 2064 5627 to destroy 622 5658 us 2248? I know 1492 5758 thee 4571 who 5101 thou art 1488 5748, the Holy One 40 of God 2316. 

1:25 And 2532 Jesus 2424 rebuked 2008 5656 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Hold thy peace 5392 5682, and 2532 come 1831 5628 out of 1537 him 846. 

1:26 And 2532 when the unclean 169 spirit 4151 had torn 4682 5660 him 846, and 2532 cried 2896 5660 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, he came 1831 5627 out of 1537 him 846. 

1:27 And 2532 they were 2284 0 all 3956 amazed 2284 5681, insomuch that 5620 they questioned 4802 5721 among 4314 themselves 848, saying 3004 5723, What thing 5101 is 2076 5748 this 3778? what 5101 new 2537 doctrine 1322 [is] this 5124? for 3754 with 2596 authority 1849 commandeth 2004 5719 he even 2532 the unclean 169 spirits 4151, and 2532 they do obey 5219 5719 him 846. 

1:28 And 1161 immediately 2117 his 846 fame 189 spread abroad 1831 5627 throughout 1519 all 3650 the region round about 4066 Galilee 1056. 

1:29 And 2532 forthwith 2112, when they were come 1831 5631 out of 1537 the synagogue 4864, they entered 2064 5627 into 1519 the house 3614 of Simon 4613 and 2532 Andrew 406, with 3326 James 2385 and 2532 John 2491. 

1:30 But 1161 Simon's 4613 wife's mother 3994 lay 2621 5711 sick of a fever 4445 5723, and 2532 anon 2112 they tell 3004 5719 him 846 of 4012 her 846. 

1:31 And 2532 he came 4334 5631 and took 2902 5660 her 846 by the hand 5495, and lifted 1453 0 her 846 up 1453 5656; and 2532 immediately 2112 the fever 4446 left 863 5656 her 846, and 2532 she ministered 1247 5707 unto them 846. 

1:32 And 1161 at 1096 5637 even 3798, when 3753 the sun 2246 did set 1416 5627, they brought 5342 5707 unto 4314 him 846 all 3956 that were 2192 5723 diseased 2560, and 2532 them that were possessed with devils 1139 5740. 

1:33 And 2532 all 3650 the city 4172 was 2258 5713 gathered together 1996 5772 at 4314 the door 2374. 

1:34 And 2532 he healed 2323 5656 many 4183 that were 2192 5723 sick 2560 of divers 4164 diseases 3554, and 2532 cast out 1544 5627 many 4183 devils 1140; and 2532 suffered 863 5707 not 3756 the devils 1140 to speak 2980 5721, because 3754 they knew 1492 5715 him 846. 

1:35 And 2532 in the morning 4404, rising up 450 5631 a great while 3029 before day 1773, he went out 1831 5627, and 2532 departed 565 5627 into 1519 a solitary 2048 place 5117, and there 2546 prayed 4336 5711. 

1:36 And 2532 Simon 4613 and 2532 they that were with 3326 him 846 followed after 2614 5656 him 846. 

1:37 And 2532 when they had found 2147 5631 him 846, they said 3004 5719 unto him 846, 3754 All 3956 [men] seek 2212 5719 for thee 4571. 

1:38 And 2532 he said 3004 5719 unto them 846, Let us go 71 5725 into 1519 the next 2192 5746 towns 2969, that 2443 I may preach 2784 5661 there also 2546: for 1063 therefore 1519 5124 came I forth 1831 5758. 

1:39 And 2532 he preached 2784 5723 2258 5713 in 1722 their 846 synagogues 4864 throughout 1519 all 3650 Galilee 1056, and 2532 cast out 1544 5723 devils 1140. 

1:40 And 2532 there came 2064 5736 a leper 3015 to 4314 him 846, beseeching 3870 5723 him 846, and 2532 kneeling down 1120 5723 to him 846, and 2532 saying 3004 5723 unto him 846, 3754 If 1437 thou wilt 2309 5725, thou canst 1410 5736 make 2511 0 me 3165 clean 2511 5658. 

1:41 And 1161 Jesus 2424, moved with compassion 4697 5679, put forth 1614 5660 [his] hand 5495, and touched 680 5662 him 846, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, I will 2309 5719; be thou clean 2511 5682. 

1:42 And 2532 as soon as he 846 had spoken 2036 5631, immediately 2112 the leprosy 3014 departed 565 5627 from 575 him 846, and 2532 he was cleansed 2511 5681. 

1:43 And 2532 he straitly charged 1690 5666 him 846, and forthwith 2112 sent 1544 0 him 846 away 1544 5627; 

1:44 And 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, See 3708 5720 thou say 2036 5632 nothing 3367 to any man 3367: but 235 go thy way 5217 5720, shew 1166 5657 thyself 4572 to the priest 2409, and 2532 offer 4374 5628 for 4012 thy 4675 cleansing 2512 those things which Moses 3475 commanded 4367 5656, for 1519 a testimony 3142 unto them 846. 

1:45 But 1161 he went out 1831 5631, and began 756 5662 to publish 2784 5721 [it] much 4183, and 2532 to blaze abroad 1310 5721 the matter 3056, insomuch that 5620 Jesus 846 could 1410 5738 no more 3371 openly 5320 enter 1525 5629 into 1519 the city 4172, but 235 was 2258 5713 without 1854 in 1722 desert 2048 places 5117: and 2532 they came 2064 5711 to 4314 him 846 from every quarter 3836. 

2:1 And 2532 again 3825 he entered 1525 5627 into 1519 Capernaum 2584 after 1223 [some] days 2250; and 2532 it was noised 191 5681 that 3754 he was 2076 5748 in 1519 the house 3624. 

2:2 And 2532 straightway 2112 many 4183 were gathered together 4863 5681, insomuch that 5620 there was 5562 0 no 3371 room to receive 5562 5721 [them], no, not so much 3366 as about 4314 the door 2374: and 2532 he preached 2980 5707 the word 3056 unto them 846. 

2:3 And 2532 they come 2064 5736 unto 4314 him 846, bringing 5342 5723 one sick of the palsy 3885, which was borne 142 5746 of 5259 four 5064. 

2:4 And 2532 when they could 1410 5740 not 3361 come nigh 4331 5658 unto him 846 for 1223 the press 3793, they uncovered 648 5656 the roof 4721 where 3699 he was 2258 5713: and 2532 when they had broken [it] up 1846 5660, they let down 5465 5719 the bed 2895 wherein 1909 3739 the sick of the palsy 3885 lay 2621 5711. 

2:5 When 1161 Jesus 2424 saw 1492 5631 their 846 faith 4102, he said 3004 5719 unto the sick of the palsy 3885, Son 5043, thy 4675 sins 266 be forgiven 863 5769 thee 4671. 

2:6 But 1161 there were 2258 5713 certain 5100 of the scribes 1122 sitting 2521 5740 there 1563, and 2532 reasoning 1260 5740 in 1722 their 848 hearts 2588, 

2:7 Why 5101 doth 2980 0 this 3778 [man] thus 3779 speak 2980 5719 blasphemies 988? who 5101 can 1410 5736 forgive 863 5721 sins 266 but 1508 God 2316 only 1520? 

2:8 And 2532 immediately 2112 when Jesus 2424 perceived 1921 5631 in his 848 spirit 4151 that 3754 they so 3779 reasoned 1260 5736 within 1722 themselves 1438, he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Why 5101 reason ye 1260 5736 these things 5023 in 1722 your 5216 hearts 2588? 

2:9 Whether 5101 is it 2076 5748 easier 2123 to say 2036 5629 to the sick of the palsy 3885, [Thy] sins 266 be forgiven 863 5769 thee 4671; or 2228 to say 2036 5629, Arise 1453 5669, and 2532 take up 142 5657 thy 4675 bed 2895, and 2532 walk 4043 5720? 

2:10 But 1161 that 2443 ye may know 1492 5762 that 3754 the Son 5207 of man 444 hath 2192 5719 power 1849 on 1909 earth 1093 to forgive 863 5721 sins 266, (he saith 3004 5719 to the sick of the palsy 3885) 

2:11 I say 3004 5719 unto thee 4671, Arise 1453 5669, and 2532 take up 142 5657 thy 4675 bed 2895, and 2532 go thy way 5217 5720 into 1519 thine 4675 house 3624. 

2:12 And 2532 immediately 2112 he arose 1453 5681, took up 142 5660 the bed 2895, and 2532 went forth 1831 5627 before 1726 them all 3956; insomuch that 5620 they were 1839 0 all 3956 amazed 1839 5733, and 2532 glorified 1392 5721 God 2316, saying 3004 5723, 3754 We 1492 0 never 3763 saw 1492 5627 it on this fashion 3779. 

2:13 And 2532 he went forth 1831 5627 again 3825 by 3844 the sea side 2281; and 2532 all 3956 the multitude 3793 resorted 2064 5711 unto 4314 him 846, and 2532 he taught 1321 5707 them 846. 

2:14 And 2532 as he passed by 3855 5723, he saw 1492 5627 Levi 3018 the [son] of Alphaeus 256 sitting 2521 5740 at 1909 the receipt of custom 5058, and 2532 said 3004 5719 unto him 846, Follow 190 5720 me 3427. And 2532 he arose 450 5631 and followed 190 5656 him 846. 

2:15 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, that 1722, as Jesus 846 sat at meat 2621 5738 in 1722 his 846 house 3614, many 4183 publicans 5057 and 2532 sinners 268 sat 4873 0 also 2532 together with 4873 5711 Jesus 2424 and 2532 his 846 disciples 3101: for 1063 there were 2258 5713 many 4183, and 2532 they followed 190 5656 him 846. 

2:16 And 2532 when the scribes 1122 and 2532 Pharisees 5330 saw 1492 5631 him eat 2068 5723 with 3326 publicans 5057 and 2532 sinners 268, they said 3004 5707 unto his 846 disciples 3101, How 5101 is it that 3754 he eateth 2068 5719 and 2532 drinketh 4095 5719 with 3326 publicans 5057 and 2532 sinners 268? 

2:17 When 2532 Jesus 2424 heard 191 5660 [it], he saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, They that are whole 2480 5723 have 2192 5719 no 3756 need 5532 of the physician 2395, but 235 they that are 2192 5723 sick 2560: I came 2064 5627 not 3756 to call 2564 5658 the righteous 1342, but 235 sinners 268 to 1519 repentance 3341. 

2:18 And 2532 the disciples 3101 of John 2491 and 2532 of the Pharisees 5330 used 2258 5713 to fast 3522 5723: and 2532 they come 2064 5736 and 2532 say 3004 5719 unto him 846, Why do 1302 3522 0 the disciples 3101 of John 2491 and 2532 of the Pharisees 5330 fast 3522 5719, but 1161 thy 4674 disciples 3101 fast 3522 5719 not 3756? 

2:19 And 2532 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, 3361 Can 1410 5736 the children 5207 of the bridechamber 3567 fast 3522 5721, while 1722 3739 the bridegroom 3566 is 2076 5748 with 3326 them 846? as long as 3745 5550 they have 2192 5719 the bridegroom 3566 with 3326 them 1438, they cannot 3756 1410 5736 fast 3522 5721. 

2:20 But 1161 the days 2250 will come 2064 5695, when 3752 the bridegroom 3566 shall be taken away 522 5686 from 575 them 846, and 2532 then 5119 shall they fast 3522 5692 in 1722 those 1565 days 2250. 

2:21 No man 3762 also 2532 seweth 1976 5719 a piece 1915 of new 46 cloth 4470 on 1909 an old 3820 garment 2440: else 1490 the new piece 2537 that filled it up 4138 taketh away 142 5719 from 846 the old 3820, and 2532 the rent 4978 is made 1096 5736 worse 5501. 

2:22 And 2532 no man 3762 putteth 906 5719 new 3501 wine 3631 into 1519 old 3820 bottles 779: else 1490 the new 3501 wine 3631 doth burst 4486 5719 the bottles 779, and 2532 the wine 3631 is spilled 1632 5743, and 2532 the bottles 779 will be marred 622 5698: but 235 new 3501 wine 3631 must be put 992 into 1519 new 2537 bottles 779. 

2:23 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, that he went 3899 5738 through 1223 the corn fields 4702 on 1722 the sabbath day 4521; and 2532 his 846 disciples 3101 began 756 5662, as they went 3598 4160 5721, to pluck 5089 5723 the ears of corn 4719. 

2:24 And 2532 the Pharisees 5330 said 3004 5707 unto him 846, Behold 2396, why 5101 do they 4160 5719 on 1722 the sabbath day 4521 that which 3739 is 1832 0 not 3756 lawful 1832 5748? 

2:25 And 2532 he said 3004 5707 unto them 846, Have ye never 3763 read 314 5627 what 5101 David 1138 did 4160 5656, when 3753 he had 2192 5627 need 5532, and 2532 was an hungred 3983 5656, he 846, and 2532 they that were with 3326 him 846? 

2:26 How 4459 he went 1525 5627 into 1519 the house 3624 of God 2316 in the days 1909 of Abiathar 8 the high priest 749, and 2532 did eat 5315 5627 the shewbread 740 4286, which 3739 is 1832 0 not 3756 lawful 1832 5748 to eat 5315 5629 but for 1508 the priests 2409, and 2532 gave 1325 5656 also 2532 to them which were 5607 5752 with 4862 him 846? 

2:27 And 2532 he said 3004 5707 unto them 846, The sabbath 4521 was made 1096 5633 for 1223 man 444, and not 3756 man 444 for 1223 the sabbath 4521: 

2:28 Therefore 5620 the Son 5207 of man 444 is 2076 5748 Lord 2962 also 2532 of the sabbath 4521. 

3:1 And 2532 he entered 1525 5627 again 3825 into 1519 the synagogue 4864; and 2532 there was 2258 5713 a man 444 there 1563 which had 2192 5723 a withered 3583 5772 hand 5495. 

3:2 And 2532 they watched 3906 5707 him 846, whether 1487 he would heal 2323 5692 him 846 on the sabbath day 4521; that 2443 they might accuse 2723 5661 him 846. 

3:3 And 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto the man 444 which had 2192 5723 the withered 3583 5772 hand 5495, Stand 1453 5669 forth 1519 3319. 

3:4 And 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Is it lawful 1832 5748 to do good 15 5658 on the sabbath days 4521, or 2228 to do evil 2554 5658? to save 4982 5658 life 5590, or 2228 to kill 615 5658? But 1161 they held their peace 4623 5707. 

3:5 And 2532 when he had looked round about 4017 5671 on them 846 with 3326 anger 3709, being grieved 4818 5740 for 1909 the hardness 4457 of their 846 hearts 2588, he saith 3004 5719 unto the man 444, Stretch forth 1614 5657 thine 4675 hand 5495. And 2532 he stretched [it] out 1614 5656: and 2532 his 846 hand 5495 was restored 600 5681 whole 5199 as 5613 the other 243. 

3:6 And 2532 the Pharisees 5330 went forth 1831 5631, and straightway 2112 took 4160 5707 counsel 4824 with 3326 the Herodians 2265 against 2596 him 846, how 3704 they might destroy 622 5661 him 846. 

3:7 But 2532 Jesus 2424 withdrew himself 402 5656 with 3326 his 848 disciples 3101 to 4314 the sea 2281: and 2532 a great 4183 multitude 4128 from 575 Galilee 1056 followed 190 5656 him 846, and 2532 from 575 Judaea 2449, 

3:8 And 2532 from 575 Jerusalem 2414, and 2532 from 575 Idumaea 2401, and 2532 [from] beyond 4008 Jordan 2446; and 2532 they about 4012 Tyre 5184 and 2532 Sidon 4605, a great 4183 multitude 4128, when they had heard 191 5660 what great things 3745 he did 4160 5707, came 2064 5627 unto 4314 him 846. 

3:9 And 2532 he spake 2036 5627 to his 848 disciples 3101, that 2443 a small ship 4142 should wait on 4342 5725 him 846 because 1223 of the multitude 3793, lest 3363 they should throng 2346 5725 him 846. 

3:10 For 1063 he had healed 2323 5656 many 4183; insomuch that 5620 they pressed upon 1968 5721 him 846 for to 2443 touch 680 5672 him 846, as many as 3745 had 2192 5707 plagues 3148. 

3:11 And 2532 unclean 169 spirits 4151, when 3752 they saw 2334 5707 him 846, fell down before 4363 5707 him 846, and 2532 cried 2896 5707, saying 3004 5723, 3754 Thou 4771 art 1488 5748 the Son 5207 of God 2316. 

3:12 And 2532 he straitly 4183 charged 2008 5707 them 846 that 3363 0 they should 4160 0 not 3363 make 4160 5661 him 846 known 5318. 

3:13 And 2532 he goeth up 305 5719 into 1519 a mountain 3735, and 2532 calleth 4341 5736 [unto him] whom 3739 he 846 would 2309 5707: and 2532 they came 565 5627 unto 4314 him 846. 

3:14 And 2532 he ordained 4160 5656 twelve 1427, that 2443 they should be 5600 5753 with 3326 him 846, and 2532 that 2443 he might send 649 0 them 846 forth 649 5725 to preach 2784 5721, 

3:15 And 2532 to have 2192 5721 power 1849 to heal 2323 5721 sicknesses 3554, and 2532 to cast out 1544 5721 devils 1140: 

3:16 And 2532 Simon 4613 he surnamed 2007 5656 3686 Peter 4074; 

3:17 And 2532 James 2385 the [son] 3588 of Zebedee 2199, and 2532 John 2491 the brother 80 of James 2385; and 2532 he surnamed 2007 5656 3686 them 846 Boanerges 993, which 3603 is 2076 5748, The sons 5207 of thunder 1027: 

3:18 And 2532 Andrew 406, and 2532 Philip 5376, and 2532 Bartholomew 918, and 2532 Matthew 3156, and 2532 Thomas 2381, and 2532 James 2385 the [son] 3588 of Alphaeus 256, and 2532 Thaddaeus 2280, and 2532 Simon 4613 the Canaanite 2581, 

3:19 And 2532 Judas 2455 Iscariot 2469, which 3739 also 2532 betrayed 3860 5656 him 846: and 2532 they went 2064 5736 into 1519 an house 3624. 

3:20 And 2532 the multitude 3793 cometh together 4905 5736 again 3825, so that 5620 they 846 could 1410 5738 not 3361 so much as 3383 eat 5315 5629 bread 740. 

3:21 And 2532 when his 846 friends 3844 heard 191 5660 [of it], they went out 1831 5627 to lay hold 2902 5658 on him 846: for 1063 they said 3004 5707, 3754 He is beside himself 1839 5627. 

3:22 And 2532 the scribes 1122 which 3588 came down 2597 5631 from 575 Jerusalem 2414 said 3004 5707, 3754 He hath 2192 5719 Beelzebub 954, 3754 and 2532 by 1722 the prince 758 of the devils 1140 casteth he out 1544 5719 devils 1140. 

3:23 And 2532 he called 4341 5666 them 846 [unto him], and said 3004 5707 unto them 846 in 1722 parables 3850, How 4459 can 1410 5736 Satan 4567 cast out 1544 5721 Satan 4567? 

3:24 And 2532 if 1437 a kingdom 932 be divided 3307 5686 against 1909 itself 1438, that 1565 kingdom 932 cannot 3756 1410 5736 stand 2476 5683. 

3:25 And 2532 if 1437 a house 3614 be divided 3307 5686 against 1909 itself 1438, that 1565 house 3614 cannot 3756 1410 5736 stand 2476 5683. 

3:26 And 2532 if 1487 Satan 4567 rise up 450 5627 against 1909 himself 1438, and 2532 be divided 3307 5769, he cannot 3756 1410 5736 stand 2476 5683, but 235 hath 2192 5719 an end 5056. 

3:27 No man 3762 can 3756 1410 5736 enter 1525 5631 into 1519 a strong man's 2478 house 3614, and spoil 1283 5658 his 846 goods 4632, except 3362 he will 1210 0 first 4412 bind 1210 5661 the strong man 2478; and 2532 then 5119 he will spoil 1283 5692 his 846 house 3614. 

3:28 Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, 3754 All 3956 sins 265 shall be forgiven 863 5701 unto the sons 5207 of men 444, and 2532 blasphemies 988 wherewith 3745 soever 302 they shall blaspheme 987 5661: 

3:29 But 1161 he that 302 shall blaspheme 987 5661 against 1519 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151 hath 2192 5719 never 3756 1519 165 forgiveness 859, but 235 is 2076 5748 in danger 1777 of eternal 166 damnation 2920: 

3:30 Because 3754 they said 3004 5707, He hath 2192 5719 an unclean 169 spirit 4151. 

3:31 There came 2064 5736 then 3767 his 846 brethren 80 and 2532 his mother 3384, and 2532, standing 2476 5761 without 1854, sent 649 5656 unto 4314 him 846, calling 5455 5723 him 846. 

3:32 And 2532 the multitude 3793 sat 2521 5711 about 4012 him 846, and 1161 they said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Behold 2400 5628, thy 4675 mother 3384 and 2532 thy 4675 brethren 80 without 1854 seek for 2212 5719 thee 4571. 

3:33 And 2532 he answered 611 5662 them 846, saying 3004 5723, Who 5101 is 2076 5748 my 3450 mother 3384, or 2228 my 3450 brethren 80? 

3:34 And 2532 he looked 4017 5671 round about 2945 on them which 3588 sat 2521 5740 about 4012 him 848, and said 3004 5719, Behold 2396 my 3450 mother 3384 and 2532 my 3450 brethren 80! 

3:35 For 1063 whosoever 3739 302 shall do 4160 5661 the will 2307 of God 2316, the same 3778 is 2076 5748 my 3450 brother 80, and 2532 my 3450 sister 79, and 2532 mother 3384. 

4:1 And 2532 he began 756 5662 again 3825 to teach 1321 5721 by 3844 the sea side 2281: and 2532 there was gathered 4863 5681 unto 4314 him 846 a great 4183 multitude 3793, so that 5620 he entered 1684 5631 into 1519 a ship 4143, and sat 2521 5738 in 1722 the sea 2281; and 2532 the whole 3956 multitude 3793 was 2258 5713 by 4314 the sea 2281 on 1909 the land 1093. 

4:2 And 2532 he taught 1321 5707 them 846 many things 4183 by 1722 parables 3850, and 2532 said 3004 5707 unto them 846 in 1722 his 848 doctrine 1322, 

4:3 Hearken 191 5720; Behold 2400 5628, there went out 1831 5627 a sower 4687 5723 to sow 4687 5658: 

4:4 And 2532 it came to pass 1096 5633, as 1722 he sowed 4687 5721, some 3739 3303 fell 4098 5627 by 3844 the way side 3598, and 2532 the fowls 4071 of the air 3772 came 2064 5627 and 2532 devoured 2719 0 it 846 up 2719 5627. 

4:5 And 1161 some 243 fell 4098 5627 on 1909 stony ground 4075, where 3699 it had 2192 5707 not 3756 much 4183 earth 1093; and 2532 immediately 2112 it sprang up 1816 5656, because 1223 it had 2192 5721 no 3361 depth 899 of earth 1093: 

4:6 But 1161 when 393 0 the sun 2246 was up 393 5660, it was scorched 2739 5681; and 2532 because 1223 it had 2192 5721 no 3361 root 4491, it withered away 3583 5681. 

4:7 And 2532 some 243 fell 4098 5627 among 1519 thorns 173, and 2532 the thorns 173 grew up 305 5627, and 2532 choked 4846 5656 it 846, and 2532 it yielded 1325 5656 no 3756 fruit 2590. 

4:8 And 2532 other 243 fell 4098 5627 on 1519 good 2570 ground 1093, and 2532 did yield 1325 5707 fruit 2590 that sprang up 305 5723 and 2532 increased 837 5723; and 2532 brought forth 5342 5707, some 1520 thirty 5144, and 2532 some 1520 sixty 1835, and 2532 some 1520 an hundred 1540. 

4:9 And 2532 he said 3004 5707 unto them 846, He that hath 2192 5723 ears 3775 to hear 191 5721, let him hear 191 5720. 

4:10 And 1161 when 3753 he was 1096 5633 alone 2651, they that were about 4012 him with 4862 the twelve 1427 asked 2065 5656 of him 846 the parable 3850. 

4:11 And 2532 he said 3004 5707 unto them 846, Unto you 5213 it is given 1325 5769 to know 1097 5629 the mystery 3466 of the kingdom 932 of God 2316: but 1161 unto them 1565 that are without 1854, all [these] things 3956 are done 1096 5736 in 1722 parables 3850: 

4:12 That 2443 seeing 991 5723 they may see 991 5725, and 2532 not 3361 perceive 1492 5632; and 2532 hearing 191 5723 they may hear 191 5725, and 2532 not 3361 understand 4920 5725; lest at any time 3379 they should be converted 1994 5661, and 2532 [their] sins 265 should be forgiven 863 5686 them 846. 

4:13 And 2532 he said 3004 5719 unto them 846, Know ye 1492 5758 not 3756 this 5026 parable 3850? and 2532 how then 4459 will ye know 1097 5695 all 3956 parables 3850? 

4:14 The sower 4687 5723 soweth 4687 5719 the word 3056. 

4:15 And 1161 these 3778 are they 1526 5748 by 3844 the way side 3598, where 3699 the word 3056 is sown 4687 5743; but 2532 when 3752 they have heard 191 5661, Satan 4567 cometh 2064 5736 immediately 2112, and 2532 taketh away 142 5719 the word 3056 that was sown 4687 5772 in 1722 their 846 hearts 2588. 

4:16 And 2532 these 3778 are they 1526 5748 likewise 3668 which are sown 4687 5746 on 1909 stony ground 4075; who 3739, when 3752 they have heard 191 5661 the word 3056, immediately 2112 receive 2983 5719 it 846 with 3326 gladness 5479; 

4:17 And 2532 have 2192 5719 no 3756 root 4491 in 1722 themselves 1438, and 235 so endure 1526 5748 but for a time 4340: afterward 1534, when affliction 2347 or persecution 1375 ariseth 1096 5637 for 1223 the word's sake 3056, immediately 2112 they are offended 4624 5743. 

4:18 And 2532 these 3778 are 1526 5748 they which are 1526 5748 sown 4687 5746 among 1519 thorns 173; such as 3778 hear 191 5723 the word 3056, 

4:19 And 2532 the cares 3308 of this 5127 world 165, and 2532 the deceitfulness 539 of riches 4149, and 2532 the lusts 1939 of 4012 other things 3062 entering in 1531 5740, choke 4846 5719 the word 3056, and 2532 it becometh 1096 5736 unfruitful 175. 

4:20 And 2532 these 3778 are 1526 5748 they which are sown 4687 5651 on 1909 good 2570 ground 1093; such as 3748 hear 191 5719 the word 3056, and 2532 receive 3858 5736 [it], and 2532 bring forth fruit 2592 5719, some 1520 thirtyfold 5144, some 2532 1520 sixty 1835, and 2532 some 1520 an hundred 1540. 

4:21 And 2532 he said 3004 5707 unto them 846, Is 3385 a candle 3088 brought 2064 5736 to 2443 be put 5087 5686 under 5259 a bushel 3426, or 2228 under 5259 a bed 2825? and not 3756 to 2443 be set 2007 5686 on 1909 a candlestick 3087? 

4:22 For 1063 there is 2076 5748 nothing 3756 hid 2927 5100, which 3739 shall 5319 0 not 3362 be manifested 5319 5686; neither 3761 was any thing kept 1096 5633 secret 614, but 235 that 2443 it should come 2064 5632 abroad 1519 5318. 

4:23 If any man 1536 have 2192 5719 ears 3775 to hear 191 5721, let him hear 191 5720. 

4:24 And 2532 he said 3004 5707 unto them 846, Take heed 991 5720 what 5101 ye hear 191 5719: with 1722 what 3739 measure 3358 ye mete 3354 5719, it shall be measured 3354 5701 to you 5213: and 2532 unto you 5213 that hear 191 5723 shall more be given 4369 5701. 

4:25 For 1063 302 he that 3739 hath 2192 5725, to him 846 shall be given 1325 5701: and 2532 he that 3739 hath 2192 5719 not 3756, from 575 him 846 shall be taken 142 5701 even 2532 that which 3739 he hath 2192 5719. 

4:26 And 2532 he said 3004 5707, So 3779 is 2076 5748 the kingdom 932 of God 2316, as 5613 if 1437 a man 444 should cast 906 5632 seed 4703 into 1909 the ground 1093; 

4:27 And 2532 should sleep 2518 5725, and 2532 rise 1453 5747 night 3571 and 2532 day 2250, and 2532 the seed 4703 should spring 985 5725 and 2532 grow up 3373 5747, he 846 knoweth 1492 5758 not 3756 how 5613. 

4:28 For 1063 the earth 1093 bringeth forth fruit 2592 5719 of herself 844; first 4412 the blade 5528, then 1534 the ear 4719, after that 1534 the full 4134 corn 4621 in 1722 the ear 4719. 

4:29 But 1161 when 3752 the fruit 2590 is brought forth 3860 5632, immediately 2112 he putteth in 649 5719 the sickle 1407, because 3754 the harvest 2326 is come 3936 5758. 

4:30 And 2532 he said 3004 5707, Whereunto 5101 shall we liken 3666 5661 the kingdom 932 of God 2316? or 2228 with 1722 what 4169 comparison 3850 shall we compare 3846 5632 it 846? 

4:31 [It is] like 5613 a grain 2848 of mustard seed 4615, which 3739, when 3752 it is sown 4687 5652 in 1909 the earth 1093, is less 3398 than all 3956 the seeds 4690 that be 2076 5748 in 1909 the earth 1093: 

4:32 But 2532 when 3752 it is sown 4687 5652, it groweth up 305 5719, and 2532 becometh 1096 5736 greater than 3187 all 3956 herbs 3001, and 2532 shooteth out 4160 5719 great 3173 branches 2798; so that 5620 the fowls 4071 of the air 3772 may 1410 5738 lodge 2681 5721 under 5259 the shadow 4639 of it 846. 

4:33 And 2532 with many 4183 such 5108 parables 3850 spake he 2980 5707 the word 3056 unto them 846, as 2531 they were able 1410 5711 to hear 191 5721 [it]. 

4:34 But 1161 without 5565 a parable 3850 spake 2980 5707 he not 3756 unto them 846: and 1161 when they were alone 2398 2596, he expounded 1956 5707 all things 3956 to his 848 disciples 3101. 

4:35 And 2532 the 1722 same 1565 day 2250, when the even 3798 was come 1096 5637, he saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Let us pass over 1330 5632 unto 1519 the other side 4008. 

4:36 And 2532 when they had sent away 863 5631 the multitude 3793, they took 3880 5719 him 846 even as 5613 he was 2258 5713 in 1722 the ship 4143. And 1161 there were 2258 5713 also 2532 with 3326 him 846 other 243 little ships 4142. 

4:37 And 2532 there arose 1096 5736 a great 3173 storm 2978 of wind 417, and 1161 the waves 2949 beat 1911 5707 into 1519 the ship 4143, so that 5620 it 846 was 1072 0 now 2235 full 1072 5745. 

4:38 And 2532 he was 2258 5713 in 1909 the hinder part of the ship 4403, asleep 2518 5723 on 1909 a pillow 4344: and 2532 they awake 1326 5719 him 846, and 2532 say 3004 5719 unto him 846, Master 1320, carest 3199 5719 thou 4671 not 3756 that 3754 we perish 622 5731? 

4:39 And 2532 he arose 1326 5685, and rebuked 2008 5656 the wind 417, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto the sea 2281, Peace 4623 5720, be still 5392 5770. And 2532 the wind 417 ceased 2869 5656, and 2532 there was 1096 5633 a great 3173 calm 1055. 

4:40 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Why 5101 are ye 2075 5748 so 3779 fearful 1169? how is it 4459 that ye have 2192 5719 no 3756 faith 4102? 

4:41 And 2532 they feared 5399 5675 exceedingly 5401 3173, and 2532 said 3004 5707 one 240 0 to 4314 another 240, What 5101 manner of man 686 is 2076 5748 this 3778, that 3754 even 2532 the wind 417 and 2532 the sea 2281 obey 5219 5719 him 846? 

5:1 And 2532 they came over 2064 5627 unto 1519 the other side 4008 of the sea 2281, into 1519 the country 5561 of the Gadarenes 1046. 

5:2 And 2532 when he was come 1831 5631 out of 1537 the ship 4143, immediately 2112 there met 528 5656 him 846 out of 1537 the tombs 3419 a man 444 with 1722 an unclean 169 spirit 4151, 

5:3 Who 3739 had 2192 5707 [his] dwelling 2731 among 1722 the tombs 3419; and 2532 no man 3762 could 1410 5711 bind 1210 5658 him 846, no, not 3777 with chains 254: 

5:4 Because 1223 that he 846 had been often 4178 bound 1210 5771 with fetters 3976 and 2532 chains 254, and 2532 the chains 254 had been plucked asunder 1288 5771 by 5259 him 846, and 2532 the fetters 3976 broken in pieces 4937 5771: neither 2532 could 2480 5707 any [man] tame 1150 5658 him 846 3762. 

5:5 And 2532 always 1275, night 3571 and 2532 day 2250, he was 2258 5713 in 1722 the mountains 3735, and 2532 in 1722 the tombs 3418, crying 2896 5723, and 2532 cutting 2629 5723 himself 1438 with stones 3037. 

5:6 But 1161 when he saw 1492 5631 Jesus 2424 afar off 575 3113, he ran 5143 5627 and 2532 worshipped 4352 5656 him 846, 

5:7 And 2532 cried 2896 5660 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, and said 2036 5627, What 5101 have I 1698 to do 2532 with thee 4671, Jesus 2424, [thou] Son 5207 of the most high 5310 God 2316? I adjure 3726 5719 thee 4571 by God 2316, that thou torment 928 5661 me 3165 not 3361. 

5:8 For 1063 he said 3004 5707 unto him 846, Come 1831 5628 out of 1537 the man 444, [thou] unclean 169 spirit 4151. 

5:9 And 2532 he asked 1905 5707 him 846, What 5101 [is] thy 4671 name 3686? And 2532 he answered 611 5662, saying 3004 5723, My 3427 name 3686 [is] Legion 3003: for 3754 we are 2070 5748 many 4183. 

5:10 And 2532 he besought 3870 5707 him 846 much 4183 that 3363 0 he would 649 0 not 3363 send 649 0 them 846 away 649 5661 out of 1854 the country 5561. 

5:11 Now 1161 there was 2258 5713 there 1563 nigh 4314 unto the mountains 3735 a great 3173 herd 34 of swine 5519 feeding 1006 5746. 

5:12 And 2532 all 3956 the devils 1142 besought 3870 5656 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Send 3992 5657 us 2248 into 1519 the swine 5519, that 2443 we may enter 1525 5632 into 1519 them 846. 

5:13 And 2532 forthwith 2112 Jesus 2424 gave 2010 0 them 846 leave 2010 5656. And 2532 the unclean 169 spirits 4151 went out 1831 5631, and entered 1525 5627 into 1519 the swine 5519: and 2532 the herd 34 ran 3729 5656 violently down 2596 a steep place 2911 into 1519 the sea 2281, 1161 (they were 2258 5713 about 5613 two thousand 1367) and 2532 were choked 4155 5712 in 1722 the sea 2281. 

5:14 And 1161 they that fed 1006 5723 the swine 5519 fled 5343 5627, and 2532 told 312 5656 [it] in 1519 the city 4172, and 2532 in 1519 the country 68. And 2532 they went out 1831 5627 to see 1492 5629 what 5101 it was 2076 5748 that was done 1096 5756. 

5:15 And 2532 they come 2064 5736 to 4314 Jesus 2424, and 2532 see 2334 5719 him that was possessed with the devil 1139 5740, and had 2192 5761 the legion 3003, sitting 2521 5740, and 2532 clothed 2439 5772, and 2532 in his right mind 4993 5723: and 2532 they were afraid 5399 5675. 

5:16 And 2532 they that saw 1492 5631 [it] told 1334 5662 them 846 how 4459 it befell 1096 5633 to him that was possessed with the devil 1139 5740, and 2532 [also] concerning 4012 the swine 5519. 

5:17 And 2532 they began 756 5662 to pray 3870 5721 him 846 to depart 565 5629 out of 575 their 846 coasts 3725. 

5:18 And 2532 when he was come 1684 5631 into 1519 the ship 4143, he that had been possessed with the devil 1139 5679 prayed 3870 5707 him 846 that 2443 he might be 5600 5753 with 3326 him 846. 

5:19 Howbeit 1161 Jesus 2424 suffered 863 5656 him 846 not 3756, but 235 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Go 5217 5720 home 1519 3624 4675 to 4314 thy friends 4674, and 2532 tell 312 5657 them 846 how great things 3745 the Lord 2962 hath done 4160 5656 for thee 4671, and 2532 hath had compassion 1653 5656 on thee 4571. 

5:20 And 2532 he departed 565 5627, and 2532 began 756 5662 to publish 2784 5721 in 1722 Decapolis 1179 how great things 3745 Jesus 2424 had done 4160 5656 for him 846: and 2532 all 3956 [men] did marvel 2296 5707. 

5:21 And 2532 when Jesus 2424 was passed over 1276 5660 again 3825 by 1722 ship 4143 unto 1519 the other side 4008, much 4183 people 3793 gathered 4863 5681 unto 1909 him 846: and 2532 he was 2258 5713 nigh 3844 unto the sea 2281. 

5:22 And 2532, behold 2400 5628, there cometh 2064 5736 one 1520 of the rulers of the synagogue 752, Jairus 2383 by name 3686; and 2532 when he saw 1492 5631 him 846, he fell 4098 5719 at 4314 his 846 feet 4228, 

5:23 And 2532 besought 3870 5707 him 846 greatly 4183, saying 3004 5723, 3754 My 3450 little daughter 2365 lieth 2079 at the point of death 2192 5719: [I pray thee], come 2064 5631 and 2443 lay 2007 5632 thy hands 5495 on her 846, that 3704 she may be healed 4982 5686; and 2532 she shall live 2198 5695. 

5:24 And 2532 [Jesus] went 565 5627 with 3326 him 846; and 2532 much 4183 people 3793 followed 190 5707 him 846, and 2532 thronged 4918 5707 him 846. 

5:25 And 2532 a certain 5100 woman 1135, which had an 1722 issue 4511 of blood 129 5607 5752 twelve 1427 years 2094, 

5:26 And 2532 had suffered 3958 5631 many things 4183 of 5259 many 4183 physicians 2395, and 2532 had spent 1159 5660 all 3956 that she 1438 had 3844, and 2532 was 5623 0 nothing 3367 bettered 5623 5685, but 235 rather 3123 grew 2064 5631 worse 1519 5501, 

5:27 When she had heard 191 5660 of 4012 Jesus 2424, came 2064 5631 in 1722 the press 3793 behind 3693, and touched 680 5662 his 846 garment 2440. 

5:28 For 1063 she said 3004 5707, If 3754 2579 0 I may touch 680 5672 but 2579 his 846 clothes 2440, I shall be whole 4982 5701. 

5:29 And 2532 straightway 2112 the fountain 4077 of her 846 blood 129 was dried up 3583 5681; and 2532 she felt 1097 5627 in [her] body 4983 that 3754 she was healed 2390 5769 of 575 that plague 3148. 

5:30 And 2532 Jesus 2424, immediately 2112 knowing 1921 5631 in 1722 himself 1438 that virtue 1411 had gone 1831 5631 out of 1537 him 848, turned him about 1994 5651 in 1722 the press 3793, and said 3004 5707, Who 5101 touched 680 5662 my 3450 clothes 2440? 

5:31 And 2532 his disciples 3101 said 3004 5707 unto him 846, Thou seest 991 5719 the multitude 3793 thronging 4918 5723 thee 4571, and 2532 sayest thou 3004 5719, Who 5101 touched 680 5662 me 3450? 

5:32 And 2532 he looked round about 4017 5710 to see 1492 5629 her that had done 4160 5660 this thing 5124. 

5:33 But 1161 the woman 1135 fearing 5399 5679 and 2532 trembling 5141 5723, knowing 1492 5761 what 3739 was done 1096 5754 in 1909 her 846, came 2064 5627 and 2532 fell down before 4363 5627 him 846, and 2532 told 2036 5627 him 846 all 3956 the truth 225. 

5:34 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto her 846, Daughter 2364, thy 4675 faith 4102 hath made 4982 0 thee 4571 whole 4982 5758; go 5217 5720 in 1519 peace 1515, and 2532 be 2468 5749 whole 5199 of 575 thy 4675 plague 3148. 

5:35 While 2089 0 he 846 yet 2089 spake 2980 5723, there came 2064 5736 from 575 the ruler of the synagogue's 752 [house certain] which said 3004 5723, 3754 Thy 4675 daughter 2364 is dead 599 5627: why 5101 troublest thou 4660 5719 the Master 1320 any further 2089? 

5:36 As soon as 1161 2112 Jesus 2424 heard 191 5660 the word 3056 that was spoken 2980 5746, he saith 3004 5719 unto the ruler of the synagogue 752, Be 5399 0 not 3361 afraid 5399 5732 5737, only 3440 believe 4100 5720. 

5:37 And 2532 he suffered 863 5656 3756 no man 3762 to follow 4870 5658 him 846, save 1508 Peter 4074, and 2532 James 2385, and 2532 John 2491 the brother 80 of James 2385. 

5:38 And 2532 he cometh 2064 5736 to 1519 the house 3624 of the ruler of the synagogue 752, and 2532 seeth 2334 5719 the tumult 2351, and them that wept 2799 5723 and 2532 wailed 214 5723 greatly 4183. 

5:39 And 2532 when he was come in 1525 5631, he saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Why 5101 make ye this ado 2350 5743, and 2532 weep 2799 5719? the damsel 3813 is 599 0 not 3756 dead 599 5627, but 235 sleepeth 2518 5719. 

5:40 And 2532 they laughed 2606 0 him 846 to scorn 2606 5707. But 1161 when he had put 1544 0 them all 537 out 1544 5631, he taketh 3880 5719 the father 3962 and 2532 the mother 3384 of the damsel 3813, and 2532 them that were with 3326 him 846, and 2532 entereth in 1531 5736 where 3699 the damsel 3813 was 2258 5713 lying 345 5740. 

5:41 And 2532 he took 2902 5660 the damsel 3813 by the hand 5495, and said 3004 5719 unto her 846, Talitha 5008 cumi 2891; which 3739 is 2076 5748, being interpreted 3177 5746, Damsel 2877, I say 3004 5719 unto thee 4671, arise 1453 5669. 

5:42 And 2532 straightway 2112 the damsel 2877 arose 450 5627, and 2532 walked 4043 5707; for 1063 she was 2258 5713 [of the age] of twelve 1427 years 2094. And 2532 they were astonished 1839 5627 with a great 3173 astonishment 1611. 

5:43 And 2532 he charged 1291 5668 them 846 straitly 4183 that 2443 no man 3367 should know 1097 5632 it 5124; and 2532 commanded 2036 5627 that something should be given 1325 5683 her 846 to eat 5315 5629. 

6:1 And 2532 he went out 1831 5627 from thence 1564, and 2532 came 2064 5627 into 1519 his own 848 country 3968; and 2532 his 846 disciples 3101 follow 190 5719 him 846. 

6:2 And 2532 when the sabbath day 4521 was come 1096 5637, he began 756 5662 to teach 1321 5721 in 1722 the synagogue 4864: and 2532 many 4183 hearing 191 5723 [him] were astonished 1605 5712, saying 3004 5723, From whence 4159 hath this 5129 [man] these things 5023? and 2532 what 5101 wisdom 4678 [is] this which is given 1325 5685 unto him 846, that 3754 even 2532 such 5108 mighty works 1411 are wrought 1096 5736 by 1223 his 846 hands 5495? 

6:3 Is 2076 5748 not 3756 this 3778 the carpenter 5045, the son 5207 of Mary 3137, 1161 the brother 80 of James 2385, and 2532 Joses 2500, and 2532 of Juda 2455, and 2532 Simon 4613? and 2532 are 1526 5748 not 3756 his 846 sisters 79 here 5602 with 4314 us 2248? And 2532 they were offended 4624 5712 at 1722 him 846. 

6:4 But 1161 Jesus 2424 said 3004 5707 unto them 846 3754, A prophet 4396 is 2076 5748 not 3756 without honour 820, but 1508 in 1722 his own 848 country 3968, and 2532 among 1722 his own kin 4773, and 2532 in 1722 his own 848 house 3614. 

6:5 And 2532 he could 3756 1410 5711 there 1563 do 4160 5658 no 3762 mighty work 1411, save 1508 that he laid 2007 5631 his hands 5495 upon a few 3641 sick folk 732, and healed 2323 5656 [them]. 

6:6 And 2532 he marvelled 2296 5707 because 1223 of their 846 unbelief 570. And 2532 he went 4013 5707 round about 2945 the villages 2968, teaching 1321 5723. 

6:7 And 2532 he called 4341 5736 [unto him] the twelve 1427, and 2532 began 756 5662 to send 649 0 them 846 forth 649 5721 by two 1417 and two 1417; and 2532 gave 1325 5707 them 846 power over 1849 unclean 169 spirits 4151; 

6:8 And 2532 commanded 3853 5656 them 846 that 2443 they should take 142 5725 nothing 3367 for 1519 [their] journey 3598, save 1508 a staff 4464 only 3440; no 3361 scrip 4082, no 3361 bread 740, no 3361 money 5475 in 1519 [their] purse 2223: 

6:9 But 235 [be] shod 5265 5772 with sandals 4547; and 2532 not 3361 put on 1746 5672 5625 1746 5670 two 1417 coats 5509. 

6:10 And 2532 he said 3004 5707 unto them 846, In what place soever 3699 1437 ye enter 1525 5632 into 1519 an house 3614, there 1563 abide 3306 5720 till 2193 302 ye depart 1831 5632 from that place 1564. 

6:11 And 2532 whosoever 3745 302 shall 1209 0 not 3361 receive 1209 5667 you 5209, nor 3366 hear 191 5661 you 5216, when ye depart 1607 5740 thence 1564, shake off 1621 5657 the dust 5522 under 5270 your 5216 feet 4228 for 1519 a testimony 3142 against them 846. Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, It shall be 2071 5704 more tolerable 414 for Sodom 4670 and 2228 Gomorrha 1116 in 1722 the day 2250 of judgment 2920, than 2228 for that 1565 city 4172. 

6:12 And 2532 they went out 1831 5631, and preached 2784 5707 that 2443 men should repent 3340 5661. 

6:13 And 2532 they cast out 1544 5707 many 4183 devils 1140, and 2532 anointed 218 5707 with oil 1637 many 4183 that were sick 732, and 2532 healed 2323 5707 [them]. 

6:14 And 2532 king 935 Herod 2264 heard 191 5656 [of him]; (for 1063 his 846 name 3686 was 1096 5633 spread abroad 5318) and 2532 he said 3004 5707, That 3754 John 2491 the Baptist 907 5723 was risen 1453 5681 from 1537 the dead 3498, and 2532 therefore 1223 5124 mighty works 1411 do shew forth themselves 1754 5719 in 1722 him 846. 

6:15 Others 243 said 3004 5707, That 3754 it is 2076 5748 Elias 2243. And 1161 others 243 said 3004 5707, That 3754 it is 2076 5748 a prophet 4396, or 2228 as 5613 one of 1520 the prophets 4396. 

6:16 But 1161 when Herod 2264 heard 191 5660 [thereof], he said 2036 5627, It 3778 is 2076 5748 John 2491, whom 3754 3739 I 1473 beheaded 607 5656: he 846 is risen 1453 5681 from 1537 the dead 3498. 

6:17 For 1063 Herod 2264 himself 846 had sent forth 649 5660 and laid hold 2902 5656 upon John 2491, and 2532 bound 1210 5656 him 846 in 1722 prison 5438 for 1223 0 Herodias 2266' sake 1223, his 848 brother 80 Philip's 5376 wife 1135: for 3754 he had married 1060 5656 her 846. 

6:18 For 1063 John 2491 had said 3004 5707 unto Herod 2264, 3754 It is 1832 0 not 3756 lawful 1832 5748 for thee 4671 to have 2192 5721 thy 4675 brother's 80 wife 1135. 

6:19 Therefore 1161 Herodias 2266 had a quarrel 1758 5707 against him 846, and 2532 would 2309 5707 have killed 615 5658 him 846; but 2532 she could 1410 5711 not 3756: 

6:20 For 1063 Herod 2264 feared 5399 5711 John 2491, knowing 1492 5761 that he 846 was a just 1342 man 435 and 2532 an holy 40, and 2532 observed 4933 5707 him 846; and 2532 when he heard 191 5660 him 846, he did 4160 5707 many things 4183, and 2532 heard 191 5707 him 846 gladly 2234. 

6:21 And 2532 when a convenient 2121 day 2250 was come 1096 5637, that 3753 Herod 2264 on his 848 birthday 1077 made 4160 5707 a supper 1173 to his 848 lords 3175, 2532 high captains 5506, and 2532 chief 4413 [estates] of Galilee 1056; 

6:22 And 2532 when the daughter 2364 of the said 846 Herodias 2266 came in 1525 5631, and 2532 danced 3738 5666, and 2532 pleased 700 5660 Herod 2264 and 2532 them that sat with him 4873 5740, the king 935 said 2036 5627 unto the damsel 2877, Ask 154 5657 of me 3165 whatsoever 1437 thou wilt 2309 5725, and 2532 I will give 1325 5692 [it] thee 4671. 

6:23 And 2532 he sware 3660 5656 unto her 846, Whatsoever 3754 3739 1437 thou shalt ask 154 5661 of me 3165, I will give 1325 5692 [it] thee 4671, unto 2193 the half 2255 of my 3450 kingdom 932. 

6:24 And 1161 she went forth 1831 5631, and said 2036 5627 unto her 848 mother 3384, What 5101 shall I ask 154 5698? And 1161 she said 2036 5627, The head 2776 of John 2491 the Baptist 910. 

6:25 And 2532 she came in 1525 5631 straightway 2112 with 3326 haste 4710 unto 4314 the king 935, and asked 154 5668, saying 3004 5723, I will 2309 5719 that 2443 thou give 1325 5632 me 3427 by and by 1824 in 1909 a charger 4094 the head 2776 of John 2491 the Baptist 910. 

6:26 And 2532 the king 935 was 1096 5637 exceeding sorry 4036; [yet] for 1223 his oath's sake 3727, and 2532 for their sakes which 3588 sat with him 4873 5740, he would 2309 5656 not 3756 reject 114 5658 her 846. 

6:27 And 2532 immediately 2112 the king 935 sent 649 5660 an executioner 4688, and commanded 2004 5656 his 846 head 2776 to be brought 5342 5683: and 1161 he went 565 5631 and beheaded 607 5656 him 846 in 1722 the prison 5438, 

6:28 And 2532 brought 5342 5656 his 846 head 2776 in 1909 a charger 4094, and 2532 gave 1325 5656 it 846 to the damsel 2877: and 2532 the damsel 2877 gave 1325 5656 it 846 to her 848 mother 3384. 

6:29 And 2532 when his 846 disciples 3101 heard 191 5660 [of it], they came 2064 5627 and 2532 took up 142 5656 his 846 corpse 4430, and 2532 laid 5087 5656 it 846 in 1722 a tomb 3419. 

6:30 And 2532 the apostles 652 gathered themselves together 4863 5743 unto 4314 Jesus 2424, and 2532 told 518 5656 him 846 all things 3956, both 2532 what 3745 they had done 4160 5656, and 2532 what 3745 they had taught 1321 5656. 

6:31 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Come 1205 5773 ye 5210 yourselves 846 apart 2596 2398 into 1519 a desert 2048 place 5117, and 2532 rest 373 5732 a while 3641: for 1063 there were 2258 5713 many 4183 coming 2064 5740 and 2532 going 5217 5723, and 2532 they had no 3761 0 leisure 2119 5707 so much as 3761 to eat 5315 5629. 

6:32 And 2532 they departed 565 5627 into 1519 a desert 2048 place 5117 by ship 4143 privately 2596 2398. 

6:33 And 2532 the people 3793 saw 1492 5627 them 846 departing 5217 5723, and 2532 many 4183 knew 1921 5627 him 846, and 2532 ran 4936 5627 afoot 3979 thither 1563 out of 575 all 3956 cities 4172, and 2532 outwent 4281 5627 them 846, and 2532 came together 4905 5627 unto 4314 him 846. 

6:34 And 2532 Jesus 2424, when he came out 1831 5631, saw 1492 5627 much 4183 people 3793, and 2532 was moved with compassion 4697 5675 toward 1909 them 846, because 3754 they were 2258 5713 as 5613 sheep 4263 not 3361 having 2192 5723 a shepherd 4166: and 2532 he began 756 5662 to teach 1321 5721 them 846 many things 4183. 

6:35 And 2532 when the day 5610 was 1096 5637 now 2235 far spent 4183, his 846 disciples 3101 came 4334 5631 unto him 846, and said 3004 5719, 3754 This is 2076 5748 a desert 2048 place 5117, and 2532 now 2235 the time 5610 [is] far passed 4183: 

6:36 Send 630 0 them 846 away 630 5657, that 2443 they may go 565 5631 into 1519 the country 68 round about 2945, and 2532 into the villages 2968, and buy 59 5661 themselves 1438 bread 740: for 1063 they have 2192 5719 nothing 5101 3756 to eat 5315 5632. 

6:37 He answered 611 5679 and 1161 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Give 1325 5628 ye 5210 them 846 to eat 5315 5629. And 2532 they say 3004 5719 unto him 846, Shall we go 565 5631 and buy 59 5661 two hundred 1250 pennyworth 1220 of bread 740, and 2532 give 1325 5632 them 846 to eat 5315 5629? 

6:38 1161 He saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, How many 4214 loaves 740 have ye 2192 5719? go 5217 5720 and 2532 see 1492 5628. And 2532 when they knew 1097 5631, they say 3004 5719, Five 4002, and 2532 two 1417 fishes 2486. 

6:39 And 2532 he commanded 2004 5656 them 846 to make 347 0 all 3956 sit down 347 5658 by companies 4849 upon 1909 the green 5515 grass 5528. 

6:40 And 2532 they sat down 377 5627 in ranks 4237, by 303 hundreds 1540, and 2532 by 303 fifties 4004. 

6:41 And 2532 when he had taken 2983 5631 the five 4002 loaves 740 and 2532 the two 1417 fishes 2486, he looked up 308 5660 to 1519 heaven 3772, and blessed 2127 5656, and 2532 brake 2622 5656 the loaves 740, and 2532 gave 1325 5707 [them] to his 848 disciples 3101 to 2443 set before 3908 5632 them 846; and 2532 the two 1417 fishes 2486 divided he 3307 5656 among them all 3956. 

6:42 And 2532 they did 5315 0 all 3956 eat 5315 5627, and 2532 were filled 5526 5681. 

6:43 And 2532 they took up 142 5656 twelve 1427 baskets 2894 full 4134 of the fragments 2801, and 2532 of 575 the fishes 2486. 

6:44 And 2532 they that did eat 5315 5631 of the loaves 740 were 2258 5713 about 5616 five thousand 4000 men 435. 

6:45 And 2532 straightway 2112 he constrained 315 5656 his 848 disciples 3101 to get 1684 5629 into 1519 the ship 4143, and 2532 to go 4254 0 to 1519 the other side 4008 before 4254 5721 unto 4314 Bethsaida 966, while 2193 he 846 sent away 630 5661 the people 3793. 

6:46 And 2532 when he had sent 657 0 them 846 away 657 5671, he departed 565 5627 into 1519 a mountain 3735 to pray 4336 5664. 

6:47 And 2532 when even 3798 was come 1096 5637, the ship 4143 was 2258 5713 in 1722 the midst 3319 of the sea 2281, and 2532 he 846 alone 3441 on 1909 the land 1093. 

6:48 And 2532 he saw 1492 5627 them 846 toiling 928 5746 in 1722 rowing 1643 5721; for 1063 the wind 417 was 2258 5713 contrary 1727 unto them 846: and 2532 about 4012 the fourth 5067 watch 5438 of the night 3571 he cometh 2064 5736 unto 4314 them 846, walking 4043 5723 upon 1909 the sea 2281, and 2532 would 2309 5707 have passed by 3928 5629 them 846. 

6:49 But 1161 when they saw 1492 5631 him 846 walking 4043 5723 upon 1909 the sea 2281, they supposed 1380 5656 it had been 1511 5750 a spirit 5326, and 2532 cried out 349 5656: 

6:50 For 1063 they all 3956 saw 1492 5627 him 846, and 2532 were troubled 5015 5681. And 2532 immediately 2112 he talked 2980 5656 with 3326 them 846, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Be of good cheer 2293 5720: it is 1510 5748 I 1473; be 5399 0 not 3361 afraid 5399 5737. 

6:51 And 2532 he went up 305 5627 unto 4314 them 846 into 1519 the ship 4143; and 2532 the wind 417 ceased 2869 5656: and 2532 they were sore 3029 amazed 1839 5710 in 1722 themselves 1438 beyond 1537 measure 4053, and 2532 wondered 2296 5707. 

6:52 For 1063 they considered 4920 5656 not 3756 [the miracle] of 1909 the loaves 740: for 1063 their 846 heart 2588 was 2258 5713 hardened 4456 5772. 

6:53 And 2532 when they had passed over 1276 5660, they came 2064 5627 into 1909 the land 1093 of Gennesaret 1082, and 2532 drew to the shore 4358 5681. 

6:54 And 2532 when they were come 1831 5631 out of 1537 the ship 4143, straightway 2112 they knew 1921 5631 him 846, 

6:55 And ran through 4063 5631 that 1565 whole 3650 region round about 4066, and began 756 5662 to carry about 4064 5721 in 1909 beds 2895 those that were 2192 5723 sick 2560, where 3699 they heard 191 5707 he was 3754 1563 2076 5748. 

6:56 And 2532 whithersoever 3699 302 he entered 1531 5711, into 1519 villages 2968, or 2228 cities 4172, or 2228 country 68, they laid 5087 5707 the sick 770 5723 in 1722 the streets 58, and 2532 besought 3870 5707 him 846 that 2443 they might touch 680 5672 if 2579 0 it were but 2579 the border 2899 of his 846 garment 2440: and 2532 as many 3745 as 302 touched 680 5711 him 846 were made whole 4982 5712. 

7:1 Then 2532 came together 4863 5743 unto 4314 him 846 the Pharisees 5330, and 2532 certain 5100 of the scribes 1122, which came 2064 5631 from 575 Jerusalem 2414. 

7:2 And 2532 when they saw 1492 5631 some 5100 of his 846 disciples 3101 eat 2068 5723 bread 740 with defiled 2839, that is to say 5123 5748, with unwashen 449, hands 5495, they found fault 3201 5662. 

7:3 For 1063 the Pharisees 5330, and 2532 all 3956 the Jews 2453, except 3362 they wash 3538 5672 [their] hands 5495 oft 4435, eat 2068 5719 not 3756, holding 2902 5723 the tradition 3862 of the elders 4245. 

7:4 And 2532 [when they come] from 575 the market 58, except 3362 they wash 907 5672, they eat 2068 5719 not 3756. And 2532 many 4183 other things 243 there be 2076 5748, which 3739 they have received 3880 5627 to hold 2902 5721, [as] the washing 909 of cups 4221, and 2532 pots 3582, 2532 brasen vessels 5473, and 2532 of tables 2825. 

7:5 Then 1899 the Pharisees 5330 and 2532 scribes 1122 asked 1905 5719 him 846, Why 1302 walk 4043 5719 not 3756 thy 4675 disciples 3101 according 2596 to the tradition 3862 of the elders 4245, but 235 eat 2068 5719 bread 740 with unwashen 449 hands 5495? 

7:6 He answered 611 5679 and 1161 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, 3754 Well 2573 hath Esaias 2268 prophesied 4395 5656 of 4012 you 5216 hypocrites 5273, as 5613 it is written 1125 5769, This 3778 people 2992 honoureth 5091 5719 me 3165 with [their] lips 5491, but 1161 their 846 heart 2588 is 568 5719 far 4206 from 575 me 1700. 

7:7 Howbeit 1161 in vain 3155 do they worship 4576 5736 me 3165, teaching 1321 5723 [for] doctrines 1319 the commandments 1778 of men 444. 

7:8 For 1063 laying aside 863 5631 the commandment 1785 of God 2316, ye hold 2902 5719 the tradition 3862 of men 444, [as] the washing 909 of pots 3582 and 2532 cups 4221: and 2532 many 4183 other 243 such 5108 like things 3946 ye do 4160 5719. 

7:9 And 2532 he said 3004 5707 unto them 846, Full well 2573 ye reject 114 5719 the commandment 1785 of God 2316, that 2443 ye may keep 5083 5661 your own 5216 tradition 3862. 

7:10 For 1063 Moses 3475 said 2036 5627, Honour 5091 5720 thy 4675 father 3962 and 2532 thy 4675 mother 3384; and 2532, Whoso curseth 2551 5723 father 3962 or 2228 mother 3384, let him die 5053 5720 the death 2288: 

7:11 But 1161 ye 5210 say 3004 5719, If 1437 a man 444 shall say 2036 5632 to his father 3962 or 2228 mother 3384, [It is] Corban 2878, that 3603 is to say 2076 5748, a gift 1435, by 1537 whatsoever 1437 thou mightest be profited by 5623 5686 me 1700; [he shall be free]. 

7:12 And 2532 ye suffer 863 5719 him 846 no more 3765 to do 4160 5658 ought 3762 for his 848 father 3962 or 2228 his 848 mother 3384; 

7:13 Making 208 0 the word 3056 of God 2316 of none effect 208 5723 through your 5216 tradition 3862, which 3739 ye have delivered 3860 5656: and 2532 many 4183 such 5108 like things 3946 do ye 4160 5719. 

7:14 And 2532 when he had called 4341 5666 all 3956 the people 3793 [unto him], he said 3004 5707 unto them 846, Hearken 191 5720 unto me 3450 every one 3956 [of you], and 2532 understand 4920 5720: 

7:15 There is 2076 5748 nothing 3762 from without 1855 a man 444, that entering 1531 5740 into 1519 him 846 can 1410 5736 defile 2840 5658 him 846: but 235 the things which come 1607 5740 out of 575 him 846, those 1565 are they 2076 5748 that defile 2840 5723 the man 444. 

7:16 If any man 1536 have 2192 5719 ears 3775 to hear 191 5721, let him hear 191 5720. 

7:17 And 2532 when 3753 he was entered 1525 5627 into 1519 the house 3624 from 575 the people 3793, his 846 disciples 3101 asked 1905 5707 him 846 concerning 4012 the parable 3850. 

7:18 And 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Are 2075 5748 ye 5210 so 3779 without understanding 801 also 2532? Do ye 3539 0 not 3756 perceive 3539 5719, that 3754 whatsoever thing 3956 from without 1855 entereth 1531 5740 into 1519 the man 444, [it] cannot 3756 1410 5736 defile 2840 5658 him 846; 

7:19 Because 3754 it entereth 1531 5736 not 3756 into 1519 his 846 heart 2588, but 235 into 1519 the belly 2836, and 2532 goeth out 1607 5736 into 1519 the draught 856, purging 2511 5723 all 3956 meats 1033? 

7:20 And 1161 he said 3004 5707, 3754 That which cometh 1607 5740 out of 1537 the man 444, that 1565 defileth 2840 5719 the man 444. 

7:21 For 1063 from within 2081, out of 1537 the heart 2588 of men 444, proceed 1607 5736 evil 2556 thoughts 1261, adulteries 3430, fornications 4202, murders 5408, 

7:22 Thefts 2829, covetousness 4124, wickedness 4189, deceit 1388, lasciviousness 766, an evil 4190 eye 3788, blasphemy 988, pride 5243, foolishness 877: 

7:23 All 3956 these 5023 evil things 4190 come 1607 5736 from within 2081, and 2532 defile 2840 5719 the man 444. 

7:24 And 2532 from thence 1564 he arose 450 5631, and went 565 5627 into 1519 the borders 3181 of Tyre 5184 and 2532 Sidon 4605, and 2532 entered 1525 5631 into 1519 an house 3614, and would have 2309 5707 no man 3762 know 1097 5629 [it]: but 2532 he could 1410 5675 not 3756 be hid 2990 5629. 

7:25 For 1063 a [certain] woman 1135, whose 3739 846 young daughter 2365 had 2192 5707 an unclean 169 spirit 4151, heard 191 5660 of 4012 him 846, and came 2064 5631 and fell 4363 5627 at 4314 his 846 feet 4228: 

7:26 1161 The woman 1135 was 2258 5713 a Greek 1674, a Syrophenician 4949 by nation 1085; and 2532 she besought 2065 5707 him 846 that 2443 he would cast forth 1544 5725 the devil 1140 out of 1537 her 848 daughter 2364. 

7:27 But 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto her 846, Let 863 5628 the children 5043 first 4412 be filled 5526 5683: for 1063 it is 2076 5748 not 3756 meet 2570 to take 2983 5629 the children's 5043 bread 740, and 2532 to cast 906 5629 [it] unto the dogs 2952. 

7:28 And 1161 she answered 611 5662 and 2532 said 3004 5719 unto him 846, Yes 3483, Lord 2962: yet 2532 1063 the dogs 2952 under 5270 the table 5132 eat 2068 5719 of 575 the children's 3813 crumbs 5589. 

7:29 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto her 846, For 1223 this 5126 saying 3056 go thy way 5217 5720; the devil 1140 is gone 1831 5758 out of 1537 thy 4675 daughter 2364. 

7:30 And 2532 when she was come 565 5631 to 1519 her 848 house 3624, she found 2147 5627 the devil 1140 gone out 1831 5761, and 2532 her daughter 2364 laid 906 5772 upon 1909 the bed 2825. 

7:31 And 2532 again 3825, departing 1831 5631 from 1537 the coasts 3725 of Tyre 5184 and 2532 Sidon 4605, he came 2064 5627 unto 4314 the sea 2281 of Galilee 1056, through 303 the midst 3319 of the coasts 3725 of Decapolis 1179. 

7:32 And 2532 they bring 5342 5719 unto him 846 one that was deaf 2974, and had an impediment in his speech 3424; and 2532 they beseech 3870 5719 him 846 to 2443 put 2007 5632 his hand 5495 upon him 846. 

7:33 And 2532 he took 618 5642 him 846 aside 2596 2398 from 575 the multitude 3793, and put 906 5627 his 848 fingers 1147 into 1519 his 846 ears 3775, and 2532 he spit 4429 5660, and touched 680 5662 his 846 tongue 1100; 

7:34 And 2532 looking up 308 5660 to 1519 heaven 3772, he sighed 4727 5656, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Ephphatha 2188, that 3603 is 2076 5748, Be opened 1272 5682. 

7:35 And 2532 straightway 2112 his 846 ears 189 were opened 1272 5681, and 2532 the string 1199 of his 846 tongue 1100 was loosed 3089 5681, and 2532 he spake 2980 5707 plain 3723. 

7:36 And 2532 he charged 1291 5668 them 846 that 2443 they should tell 2036 5632 no man 3367: but 1161 the more 3745 he charged 1291 5710 them 846, so much the more 3123 a great deal 4054 they published 2784 5707 [it]; 

7:37 And 2532 were beyond measure 5249 astonished 1605 5712, saying 3004 5723, He hath done 4160 5758 all things 3956 well 2573: he maketh 4160 5719 both 2532 the deaf 2974 to hear 191 5721, and 2532 the dumb 216 to speak 2980 5721. 

8:1 In 1722 those 1565 days 2250 the multitude 3793 being 5607 5752 very great 3827, and 2532 having 2192 5723 nothing 3361 5101 to eat 5315 5632, Jesus 2424 called 4341 5666 his 848 disciples 3101 [unto him], and saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, 

8:2 I have compassion 4697 5736 on 1909 the multitude 3793, because 3754 they have 4357 0 now 2235 been 4357 5719 with me 3427 three 5140 days 2250, and 2532 have 2192 5719 nothing 3756 5101 to eat 5315 5632: 

8:3 And 2532 if 1437 I send 630 0 them 846 away 630 5661 fasting 3523 to 1519 their own 848 houses 3624, they will faint 1590 5701 by 1722 the way 3598: for 1063 divers 5100 of them 846 came 2240 5758 from far 3113. 

8:4 And 2532 his 846 disciples 3101 answered 611 5662 him 846, From whence 4159 can 1410 5695 a man 5100 satisfy 5526 5658 these 5128 [men] with bread 740 here 5602 in 1909 the wilderness 2047? 

8:5 And 2532 he asked 1905 5707 them 846, How many 4214 loaves 740 have ye 2192 5719? And 1161 they said 2036 5627, Seven 2033. 

8:6 And 2532 he commanded 3853 5656 the people 3793 to sit down 377 5629 on 1909 the ground 1093: and 2532 he took 2983 5631 the seven 2033 loaves 740, and gave thanks 2168 5660, and brake 2806 5656, and 2532 gave 1325 5707 to his 848 disciples 3101 to 2443 set before 3908 5632 [them]; and 2532 they did set [them] before 3908 5656 the people 3793. 

8:7 And 2532 they had 2192 5707 a few 3641 small fishes 2485: and 2532 he blessed 2127 5660, and commanded 2036 5627 to set 3908 0 them 846 also 2532 before 3908 5629 [them]. 

8:8 So 1161 they did eat 5315 5627, and 2532 were filled 5526 5681: and 2532 they took up 142 5656 of the broken 2801 [meat] that was left 4051 seven 2033 baskets 4711. 

8:9 And 1161 they that had eaten 5315 5631 were 2258 5713 about 5613 four thousand 5070: and 2532 he sent 630 0 them 846 away 630 5656. 

8:10 And 2532 straightway 2112 he entered 1684 5631 into 1519 a ship 4143 with 3326 his 848 disciples 3101, and came 2064 5627 into 1519 the parts 3313 of Dalmanutha 1148. 

8:11 And 2532 the Pharisees 5330 came forth 1831 5627, and 2532 began 756 5662 to question 4802 5721 with him 846, seeking 2212 5723 of 3844 him 846 a sign 4592 from 575 heaven 3772, tempting 3985 5723 him 846. 

8:12 And 2532 he sighed deeply 389 5660 in his 848 spirit 4151, and saith 3004 5719, Why 5101 doth 1934 0 this 3778 generation 1074 seek after 1934 5719 a sign 4592? verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, There shall no 1487 sign 4592 be given 1325 5701 unto this 5026 generation 1074. 

8:13 And 2532 he left 863 5631 them 846, and entering 1684 5631 into 1519 the ship 4143 again 3825 departed 565 5627 to 1519 the other side 4008. 

8:14 Now 2532 [the disciples] had forgotten 1950 5633 to take 2983 5629 bread 740, neither 2532 3756 had 2192 5707 they in 1722 the ship 4143 with 3326 them 1438 more than 1508 one 1520 loaf 740. 

8:15 And 2532 he charged 1291 5710 them 846, saying 3004 5723, Take heed 3708 5720, beware 991 5720 of 575 the leaven 2219 of the Pharisees 5330, and 2532 [of] the leaven 2219 of Herod 2264. 

8:16 And 2532 they reasoned 1260 5711 among 4314 themselves 240, saying 3004 5723, [It is] because 3754 we have 2192 5719 no 3756 bread 740. 

8:17 And 2532 when Jesus 2424 knew 1097 5631 [it], he saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Why 5101 reason ye 1260 5736, because 3754 ye have 2192 5719 no 3756 bread 740? perceive ye 3539 5719 not yet 3768, neither 3761 understand 4920 5719? have ye 2192 5719 your 5216 heart 2588 yet 2089 hardened 4456 5772? 

8:18 Having 2192 5723 eyes 3788, see ye 991 5719 not 3756? and 2532 having 2192 5723 ears 3775, hear ye 191 5719 not 3756? and 2532 do ye 3421 0 not 3756 remember 3421 5719? 

8:19 When 3753 I brake 2806 5656 the five 4002 loaves 740 among 1519 five thousand 4000, how many 4214 baskets 2894 full 4134 of fragments 2801 took ye up 142 5656? They say 3004 5719 unto him 846, Twelve 1427. 

8:20 And 1161 when 3753 the seven 2033 among 1519 four thousand 5070, how many 4214 baskets 4711 full 4138 of fragments 2801 took ye up 142 5656? And 1161 they said 2036 5627, Seven 2033. 

8:21 And 2532 he said 3004 5707 unto them 846, How 4459 is it that ye do 4920 0 not 3756 understand 4920 5719? 

8:22 And 2532 he cometh 2064 5736 to 1519 Bethsaida 966; and 2532 they bring 5342 5719 a blind man 5185 unto him 846, and 2532 besought 3870 5719 him 846 to 2443 touch 680 5672 him 846. 

8:23 And 2532 he took 1949 5637 the blind man 5185 by the hand 5495, and led 1806 5627 him 846 out of 1854 the town 2968; and 2532 when he had spit 4429 5660 on 1519 his 846 eyes 3659, and put 2007 5631 his hands 5495 upon him 846, he asked 1905 5707 him 846 if 1536 0 he saw 991 5719 ought 1536. 

8:24 And 2532 he looked up 308 5660, and said 3004 5707, 3754 I see 991 5719 men 444 as 5613 3708 5719 trees 1186, walking 4043 5723. 

8:25 After 1534 that he put 2007 5656 [his] hands 5495 again 3825 upon 1909 his 846 eyes 3788, and 2532 made 4160 5656 him 846 look up 308 5658: and 2532 he was restored 600 5681, and 2532 saw 1689 5656 every man 537 clearly 5081. 

8:26 And 2532 he sent 649 0 him 846 away 649 5656 to 1519 his 846 house 3624, saying 3004 5723, Neither 3366 go 1525 5632 into 1519 the town 2968, nor 3366 tell 2036 5632 [it] to any 5100 in 1722 the town 2968. 

8:27 And 2532 Jesus 2424 went out 1831 5627, and 2532 his 846 disciples 3101, into 1519 the towns 2968 of Caesarea 2542 Philippi 5376: and 2532 by 1722 the way 3598 he asked 1905 5707 his 848 disciples 3101, saying 3004 5723 unto them 846, Whom 5101 do 3004 0 men 444 say 3004 5719 that I 3165 am 1511 5750? 

8:28 And 1161 they answered 611 5662, John 2491 the Baptist 910: but 1161 some 243 [say], Elias 2243; and 2532 others 243, One 1520 of the prophets 4396. 

8:29 And 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, But 1161 whom 5101 say 3004 5719 ye 5210 that I 3165 am 1511 5750? And 1161 Peter 4074 answereth 611 5679 and saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Thou 4771 art 1488 5748 the Christ 5547. 

8:30 And 2532 he charged 2008 5656 them 846 that 2443 they should tell 3004 5725 no man 3367 of 4012 him 846. 

8:31 And 2532 he began 756 5662 to teach 1321 5721 them 846, that 3754 the Son 5207 of man 444 must 1163 5748 suffer 3958 5629 many things 4183, and 2532 be rejected 593 5683 of 575 the elders 4245, and 2532 [of] the chief priests 749, and 2532 scribes 1122, and 2532 be killed 615 5683, and 2532 after 3326 three 5140 days 2250 rise again 450 5629. 

8:32 And 2532 he spake 2980 5707 that saying 3056 openly 3954. And 2532 Peter 4074 took 4355 5642 him 846, and began 756 5662 to rebuke 2008 5721 him 846. 

8:33 But 1161 when he had turned about 1994 5651 and 2532 looked 1492 5631 on his 848 disciples 3101, he rebuked 2008 5656 Peter 4074, saying 3004 5723, Get thee 5217 5720 behind 3694 me 3450, Satan 4567: for 3754 thou savourest 5426 5719 not 3756 the things that be of God 2316, but 235 the things that be of men 444. 

8:34 And 2532 when he had called 4341 5666 the people 3793 [unto him] with 4862 his 848 disciples 3101 also, he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Whosoever 3748 will 2309 5719 come 2064 5629 after 3694 me 3450, let him deny 533 5663 himself 1438, and 2532 take up 142 5657 his 848 cross 4716, and 2532 follow 190 5720 me 3427. 

8:35 For 1063 whosoever 3739 302 will 2309 5725 save 4982 5658 his 848 life 5590 shall lose 622 5692 it 846; but 1161 whosoever 3739 302 shall lose 622 5661 his 848 life 5590 for 1752 my sake 1700 and 2532 the gospel's 2098, the same 3778 shall save 4982 5692 it 846. 

8:36 For 1063 what 5101 shall it profit 5623 5692 a man 444, if 1437 he shall gain 2770 5661 the whole 3650 world 2889, and 2532 lose 2210 5686 his own 848 soul 5590? 

8:37 Or 2228 what 5101 shall 1325 0 a man 444 give 1325 5692 in exchange 465 for his 848 soul 5590? 

8:38 Whosoever 3739 302 therefore 1063 shall be ashamed 1870 5680 of me 3165 and 2532 of my 1699 words 3056 in 1722 this 5026 adulterous 3428 and 2532 sinful 268 generation 1074; of him 846 also 2532 shall 1870 0 the Son 5207 of man 444 be ashamed 1870 5700, when 3752 he cometh 2064 5632 in 1722 the glory 1391 of his 848 Father 3962 with 3326 the holy 40 angels 32. 

9:1 And 2532 he said 3004 5707 unto them 846, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 there be 1526 5748 some 5100 of them that stand 2476 5761 here 5602, which 3748 shall 1089 0 not 3364 taste 1089 5667 of death 2288, till 2193 302 they have seen 1492 5632 the kingdom 932 of God 2316 come 2064 5756 with 1722 power 1411. 

9:2 And 2532 after 3326 six 1803 days 2250 Jesus 2424 taketh 3880 5719 [with him] Peter 4074, and 2532 James 2385, and 2532 John 2491, and 2532 leadeth 399 0 them 846 up 399 5719 into 1519 an high 5308 mountain 3735 apart 2596 2398 by themselves 3441: and 2532 he was transfigured 3339 5681 before 1715 them 846. 

9:3 And 2532 his 846 raiment 2440 became 1096 5633 shining 4744 5723, exceeding 3029 white 3022 as 5613 snow 5510; so as 3634 no 3756 fuller 1102 on 1909 earth 1093 can 1410 5736 white 3021 5658 them 846. 

9:4 And 2532 there appeared 3700 5681 unto them 846 Elias 2243 with 4862 Moses 3475: and 2532 they were 2258 5713 talking 4814 5723 with Jesus 2424. 

9:5 And 2532 Peter 4074 answered 611 5679 and said 3004 5719 to Jesus 2424, Master 4461, it is 2076 5748 good 2570 for us 2248 to be 1511 5750 here 5602: and 2532 let us make 4160 5661 three 5140 tabernacles 4633; one 3391 for thee 4671, and 2532 one 3391 for Moses 3475, and 2532 one 3391 for Elias 2243. 

9:6 For 1063 he wist 1492 5715 not 3756 what 5101 to say 2980 5661; for 1063 they were sore 2258 5713 afraid 1630. 

9:7 And 2532 there was 1096 5633 a cloud 3507 that overshadowed 1982 5723 them 846: and 2532 a voice 5456 came 2064 5627 out of 1537 the cloud 3507, saying 3004 5723, This 3778 is 2076 5748 my 3450 beloved 27 Son 5207: hear 191 5720 him 846. 

9:8 And 2532 suddenly 1819, when they had looked round about 4017 5671, they saw 1492 5627 no man 3762 any more 3765, save 235 Jesus 2424 only 3441 with 3326 themselves 1438. 

9:9 And 1161 as they came down 2597 5723 from 575 the mountain 3735, he charged 1291 5668 them 846 that 2443 they should tell 1334 5667 no man 3367 what things 3739 they had seen 1492 5627, till 1508 3752 the Son 5207 of man 444 were risen 450 5632 from 1537 the dead 3498. 

9:10 And 2532 they kept 2902 5656 that saying 3056 with 4314 themselves 1438, questioning one with another 4802 5723 what 5101 the rising 450 5629 from 1537 the dead 3498 should mean 2076 5748. 

9:11 And 2532 they asked 1905 5707 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Why 3754 say 3004 5719 the scribes 1122 that 3754 Elias 2243 must 1163 5748 first 4412 come 2064 5629? 

9:12 And 1161 he answered 611 5679 and told 2036 5627 them 846, Elias 2243 verily 3303 cometh 2064 5631 first 4412, and restoreth 600 5719 all things 3956; and 2532 how 4459 it is written 1125 5769 of 1909 the Son 5207 of man 444, that 2443 he must suffer 3958 5632 many things 4183, and 2532 be set at nought 1847 5686. 

9:13 But 235 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 Elias 2243 is 2064 0 indeed 2532 come 2064 5754, and 2532 they have done 4160 5656 unto him 846 whatsoever 3745 they listed 2309 5656, as 2531 it is written 1125 5769 of 1909 him 846. 

9:14 And 2532 when he came 2064 5631 to 4314 [his] disciples 3101, he saw 1492 5627 a great 4183 multitude 3793 about 4012 them 846, and 2532 the scribes 1122 questioning 4802 5723 with them 846. 

9:15 And 2532 straightway 2112 all 3956 the people 3793, when they beheld 1492 5631 him 846, were greatly amazed 1568 5681, and 2532 running to 4370 5723 [him] saluted 782 5711 him 846. 

9:16 And 2532 he asked 1905 5656 the scribes 1122, What 5101 question ye 4802 5719 with 4314 them 848? 

9:17 And 2532 one 1520 of 1537 the multitude 3793 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, Master 1320, I have brought 5342 5656 unto 4314 thee 4571 my 3450 son 5207, which hath 2192 5723 a dumb 216 spirit 4151; 

9:18 And 2532 wheresoever 3699 302 he taketh 2638 5632 him 846, he teareth 4486 5719 him 846: and 2532 he foameth 875 5719, and 2532 gnasheth 5149 5719 with his 848 teeth 3599, and 2532 pineth away 3583 5743: and 2532 I spake 2036 5627 to thy 4675 disciples 3101 that 2443 they should cast 1544 0 him 846 out 1544 5632; and 2532 they could 2480 5656 not 3756. 

9:19 He answereth 611 5679 him 846, and 1161 saith 3004 5719, O 5599 faithless 571 generation 1074, how long 2193 4219 shall I be 2071 5704 with 4314 you 5209? how long 2193 4219 shall I suffer 430 5695 you 5216? bring 5342 5720 him 846 unto 4314 me 3165. 

9:20 And 2532 they brought 5342 5656 him 846 unto 4314 him 846: and 2532 when he saw 1492 5631 him 846, straightway 2112 the spirit 4151 tare 4682 5656 him 846; and 2532 he fell 4098 5631 on 1909 the ground 1093, and wallowed 2947 5709 foaming 875 5723. 

9:21 And 2532 he asked 1905 5656 his father 3962, How long 4214 is it 2076 5748 ago 5550 since 5613 this 5124 came 1096 5754 unto him 846? And 1161 he said 2036 5627, Of a child 3812. 

9:22 And 2532 ofttimes 4178 it hath cast 906 5627 him 846 into 2532 1519 the fire 4442, and 2532 into 1519 the waters 5204, to 2443 destroy 622 5661 him 846: but 235 if 1536 0 thou canst 1410 5736 do any thing 1536, have compassion 4697 5679 on 1909 us 2248, and help 997 5657 us 2254. 

9:23 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, If 1487 thou canst 1410 5736 believe 4100 5658, all things 3956 [are] possible 1415 to him 846 that believeth 4100 5723. 

9:24 And 2532 straightway 2112 the father 3962 of the child 3813 cried out 2896 5660, and said 3004 5707 with 3326 tears 1144, Lord 2962, I believe 4100 5719; help thou 997 5720 mine 3450 unbelief 570. 

9:25 When 1161 Jesus 2424 saw 1492 5631 that 3754 the people 3793 came running together 1998 5719, he rebuked 2008 5656 the foul 169 spirit 4151, saying 3004 5723 unto him 846, [Thou] dumb 216 and 2532 deaf 2974 spirit 4151, I 1473 charge 2004 5719 thee 4671, come 1831 5628 out of 1537 him 846, and 2532 enter 1525 5632 no more 3371 into 1519 him 846. 

9:26 And 2532 [the spirit] cried 2896 5660, and 2532 rent 4682 5660 him 846 sore 4183, and came out of him 1831 5627: and 2532 he was 1096 5633 as 5616 one dead 3498; insomuch 5620 that 3754 many 4183 said 3004 5721, He is dead 599 5627. 

9:27 But 1161 Jesus 2424 took 2902 5660 him 846 by the hand 5495, and lifted 1453 0 him 846 up 1453 5656; and 2532 he arose 450 5627. 

9:28 And 2532 when he was come 1525 5631 into 1519 the house 3624, his 846 disciples 3101 asked 1905 5707 him 846 privately 2596 2398, Why 3754 could 1410 5675 not 3756 we 2249 cast 1544 0 him 846 out 1544 5629? 

9:29 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, This 5124 kind 1085 can 1410 5736 come forth 1831 5629 by 1722 nothing 3762, but 1508 by 1722 prayer 4335 and 2532 fasting 3521. 

9:30 And 2532 they departed 1831 5631 thence 1564, and passed 3899 5711 through 1223 Galilee 1056; and 2532 he would 2309 5707 not 3756 that 2443 any man 5100 should know 1097 5632 [it]. 

9:31 For 1063 he taught 1321 5707 his 848 disciples 3101, and 2532 said 3004 5707 unto them 846, 3754 The Son 5207 of man 444 is delivered 3860 5743 into 1519 the hands 5495 of men 444, and 2532 they shall kill 615 5692 him 846; and 2532 after that he is killed 615 5685, he shall rise 450 5698 the third 5154 day 2250. 

9:32 But 1161 they understood not 50 5707 that saying 4487, and 2532 were afraid 5399 5711 to ask 1905 5658 him 846. 

9:33 And 2532 he came 2064 5627 to 1519 Capernaum 2584: and 2532 being 1096 5637 in 1722 the house 3614 he asked 1905 5707 them 846, What 5101 was it that ye disputed 1260 5711 among 4314 yourselves 1438 by 1722 the way 3598? 

9:34 But 1161 they held their peace 4623 5707: for 1063 by 1722 the way 3598 they had disputed 1256 5675 among 4314 themselves 240, who 5101 [should be] the greatest 3187. 

9:35 And 2532 he sat down 2523 5660, and called 5455 5656 the twelve 1427, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, If any man 1536 desire 2309 5719 to be 1511 5750 first 4413, [the same] shall be 2071 5704 last 2078 of all 3956, and 2532 servant 1249 of all 3956. 

9:36 And 2532 he took 2983 5631 a child 3813, and set 2476 5656 him 846 in 1722 the midst 3319 of them 846: and 2532 when he had taken 1723 0 him 846 in his arms 1723 5666, he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, 

9:37 Whosoever 3739 1437 shall receive 1209 5667 one 1520 of such 5108 children 3813 in 1909 my 3450 name 3686, receiveth 1209 5736 me 1691: and 2532 whosoever 3739 1437 shall receive 1209 5667 me 1691, receiveth 1209 5736 not 3756 me 1691, but 235 him that sent 649 5660 me 3165. 

9:38 And 1161 John 2491 answered 611 5662 him 846, saying 3004 5723, Master 1320, we saw 1492 5627 one 5100 casting out 1544 5723 devils 1140 in thy 4675 name 3686, and 3739 he followeth 190 5719 not 3756 us 2254: and 2532 we forbad 2967 5656 him 846, because 3754 he followeth 190 5719 not 3756 us 2254. 

9:39 But 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627, Forbid 2967 5720 him 846 not 3361: for 1063 there is 2076 5748 no man 3762 which 3739 shall do 4160 5692 a miracle 1411 in 1909 my 3450 name 3686, that 2532 can 1410 5695 lightly 5035 speak evil 2551 5658 of me 3165. 

9:40 For 1063 he that is 2076 5748 not 3756 against 2596 us 2257 is 2076 5748 on 5228 0 our 2257 part 5228. 

9:41 For 1063 whosoever 3739 302 shall give 4222 0 you 5209 a cup 4221 of water 5204 to drink 4222 5661 in 1722 my 3450 name 3686, because 3754 ye belong 2075 5748 to Christ 5547, verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, he shall 622 0 not 3364 lose 622 5661 his 848 reward 3408. 

9:42 And 2532 whosoever 3739 302 shall offend 4624 5661 one 1520 of [these] little ones 3398 that believe 4100 5723 in 1519 me 1691, it is 2076 5748 better 2570 3123 for him 846 that 1487 a millstone 3037 3457 were hanged 4029 5736 about 4012 his 846 neck 5137, and 2532 he were cast 906 5769 into 1519 the sea 2281. 

9:43 And 2532 if 1437 thy 4675 hand 5495 offend 4624 5725 thee 4571, cut 609 0 it 846 off 609 5657: it is 2076 5748 better 2570 for thee 4671 to enter 1525 5629 into 1519 life 2222 maimed 2948, than 2228 having 2192 5723 two 1417 hands 5495 to go 565 5629 into 1519 hell 1067, into 1519 the fire 4442 that never shall be quenched 762: 

9:44 Where 3699 their 846 worm 4663 dieth 5053 5719 not 3756, and 2532 the fire 4442 is 4570 0 not 3756 quenched 4570 5743. 

9:45 And 2532 if 1437 thy 4675 foot 4228 offend 4624 5725 thee 4571, cut 609 0 it 846 off 609 5657: it is 2076 5748 better 2570 for thee 4671 to enter 1525 5629 halt 5560 into 1519 life 2222, than 2228 having 2192 5723 two 1417 feet 4228 to be cast 906 5683 into 1519 hell 1067, into 1519 the fire 4442 that never shall be quenched 762: 

9:46 Where 3699 their 846 worm 4663 dieth 5053 5719 not 3756, and 2532 the fire 4442 is 4570 0 not 3756 quenched 4570 5743. 

9:47 And 2532 if 1437 thine 4675 eye 3788 offend 4624 5725 thee 4571, pluck 1544 0 it 846 out 1544 5628: it is 2076 5748 better 2570 for thee 4671 to enter 1525 5629 into 1519 the kingdom 932 of God 2316 with one eye 3442, than 2228 having 2192 5723 two 1417 eyes 3788 to be cast 906 5683 into 1519 hell 1067 fire 4442: 

9:48 Where 3699 their 846 worm 4663 dieth 5053 5719 not 3756, and 2532 the fire 4442 is 4570 0 not 3756 quenched 4570 5743. 

9:49 For 1063 every one 3956 shall be salted 233 5701 with fire 4442, and 2532 every 3956 sacrifice 2378 shall be salted 233 5701 with salt 251. 

9:50 Salt 217 [is] good 2570: but 1161 if 1437 the salt 217 have lost 1096 5638 his saltness 358, wherewith 1722 5101 will ye season 741 5692 it 846? Have 2192 5720 salt 217 in 1722 yourselves 1438, and 2532 have peace 1514 5720 one 240 0 with 1722 another 240. 

10:1 And 2547 0 he arose 450 5631 from thence 2547, and cometh 2064 5736 into 1519 the coasts 3725 of Judaea 2449 by 1223 the farther side 4008 of Jordan 2446: and 2532 the people 3793 resort 4848 5736 unto 4314 him 846 again 3825; and 2532, as 5613 he was wont 1486 5715, he taught 1321 5707 them 846 again 3825. 

10:2 And 2532 the Pharisees 5330 came to him 4334 5631, and asked 1905 5656 him 846, Is it 1487 lawful 1832 5748 for a man 435 to put away 630 5658 [his] wife 1135? tempting 3985 5723 him 846. 

10:3 And 1161 he answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto them 846, What 5101 did Moses 3475 command 1781 5662 you 5213? 

10:4 And 1161 they said 2036 5627, Moses 3475 suffered 2010 5656 to write 1125 5658 a bill 975 of divorcement 647, and 2532 to put [her] away 630 5658. 

10:5 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto them 846, For 4314 the hardness 4641 0 of your 5216 heart 4641 he wrote 1125 5656 you 5213 this 5026 precept 1785. 

10:6 But 1161 from 575 the beginning 746 of the creation 2937 God 2316 made 4160 5656 them 846 male 730 and 2532 female 2338. 

10:7 For this cause 1752 5127 shall 2641 0 a man 444 leave 2641 5692 his 848 father 3962 and 2532 mother 3384, and 2532 cleave 4347 5701 to 4314 his 848 wife 1135; 

10:8 And 2532 they twain 1417 shall be 2071 5704 one 1519 3391 flesh 4561: so then 5620 they are 1526 5748 no more 3765 twain 1417, but 235 one 3391 flesh 4561. 

10:9 What 3739 therefore 3767 God 2316 hath joined together 4801 5656, let 5563 0 not 3361 man 444 put asunder 5563 5720. 

10:10 And 2532 in 1722 the house 3614 his 846 disciples 3101 asked 1905 5656 him 846 again 3825 of 4012 the same 846 [matter]. 

10:11 And 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Whosoever 1437 shall put away 630 5661 his 848 wife 1135, and 2532 marry 1060 5661 another 243, committeth adultery 3429 5736 against 1909 her 846. 

10:12 And 2532 if 1437 a woman 1135 shall put away 630 5661 her 848 husband 435, and 2532 be married 1060 5686 to another 243, she committeth adultery 3429 5736. 

10:13 And 2532 they brought 4374 5707 young children 3813 to him 846, that 2443 he should touch 680 5672 them 846: and 1161 [his] disciples 3101 rebuked 2008 5707 those that brought 4374 5723 [them]. 

10:14 But 1161 when Jesus 2424 saw 1492 5631 [it], he was much displeased 23 5656, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Suffer 863 5628 the little children 3813 to come 2064 5738 unto 4314 me 3165, and 2532 forbid 2967 5720 them 846 not 3361: for 1063 of such 5108 is 2076 5748 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. 

10:15 Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Whosoever 3739 shall 1209 0 not 3362 receive 1209 5667 the kingdom 932 of God 2316 as 5613 a little child 3813, he shall 1525 0 not 3364 enter 1525 5632 therein 1519 846. 

10:16 And 2532 he took 1723 0 them 846 up in his arms 1723 5666, put 5087 5723 [his] hands 5495 upon 1909 them 846, and blessed 2127 5707 them 846. 

10:17 And 2532 when he was gone forth 1607 5740 into 1519 the way 846 3598, there came 4370 0 one 1520 running 4370 5631, and 2532 kneeled 1120 5660 to him 846, and asked 1905 5707 him 846, Good 18 Master 1320, what 5101 shall I do 4160 5661 that 2443 I may inherit 2816 5661 eternal 166 life 2222? 

10:18 And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Why 5101 callest thou 3004 5719 me 3165 good 18? [there is] none 3762 good 18 but 1508 one 1520, [that is], God 2316. 

10:19 Thou knowest 1492 5758 the commandments 1785, Do 3431 0 not 3361 commit adultery 3431 5661, Do 5407 0 not 3361 kill 5407 5661, Do 2813 0 not 3361 steal 2813 5661, Do 5576 0 not 3361 bear false witness 5576 5661, Defraud 650 5661 not 3361, Honour 5091 5720 thy 4675 father 3962 and 2532 mother 3384. 

10:20 And 1161 he answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Master 1320, all 3956 these 5023 have I observed 5442 5668 from 1537 my 3450 youth 3503. 

10:21 Then 1161 Jesus 2424 beholding 1689 5660 him 846 loved 25 5656 him 846, and 2532 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, One thing 1520 thou 4671 lackest 5302 5719: go thy way 5217 5720, sell 4453 5657 whatsoever 3745 thou hast 2192 5719, and 2532 give 1325 5628 to the poor 4434, and 2532 thou shalt have 2192 5692 treasure 2344 in 1722 heaven 3772: and 2532 come 1204 5773, take up 142 5660 the cross 4716, and follow 190 5720 me 3427. 

10:22 And 1161 he was sad 4768 5660 at 1909 that saying 3056, and went away 565 5627 grieved 3076 5746: for 1063 he had 2192 5723 2258 5713 great 4183 possessions 2933. 

10:23 And 2532 Jesus 2424 looked round about 4017 5671, and saith 3004 5719 unto his 848 disciples 3101, How 4459 hardly 1423 shall they that have 2192 5723 riches 5536 enter 1525 5695 into 1519 the kingdom 932 of God 2316! 

10:24 And 1161 the disciples 3101 were astonished 2284 5712 at 1909 his 846 words 3056. But 1161 Jesus 2424 answereth 611 5679 again 3825, and saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Children 5043, how 4459 hard 1422 is it 2076 5748 for them that trust 3982 5756 in 1909 riches 5536 to enter 1525 5629 into 1519 the kingdom 932 of God 2316! 

10:25 It is 2076 5748 easier 2123 for a camel 2574 to go 1525 5629 5625 1330 5629 through 1223 the eye 5168 of a needle 4476, than 2228 for a rich man 4145 to enter 1525 5629 into 1519 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. 

10:26 And 1161 they were astonished 1605 5712 out of measure 4057, saying 3004 5723 among 4314 themselves 1438, 2532 Who 5101 then can 1410 5736 be saved 4982 5683? 

10:27 And 1161 Jesus 2424 looking upon 1689 5660 them 846 saith 3004 5719, With 3844 men 444 [it is] impossible 102, but 235 not 3756 with 3844 God 2316: for 1063 with 3844 God 2316 all things 3956 are 2076 5748 possible 1415. 

10:28 Then 2532 Peter 4074 began 756 5662 to say 3004 5721 unto him 846, Lo 2400 5628, we 2249 have left 863 5656 all 3956, and 2532 have followed 190 5656 thee 4671. 

10:29 And 1161 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, There is 2076 5748 no man 3762 that 3739 hath left 863 5656 house 3614, or 2228 brethren 80, or 2228 sisters 79, or 2228 father 3962, or 2228 mother 3384, or 2228 wife 1135, or 2228 children 5043, or 2228 lands 68, for my 1700 sake 1752, and 2532 the gospel's 2098, 

10:30 But 3362 he shall receive 2983 5632 an hundredfold 1542 now 3568 in 1722 this 5129 time 2540, houses 3614, and 2532 brethren 80, and 2532 sisters 79, and 2532 mothers 3384, and 2532 children 5043, and 2532 lands 68, with 3326 persecutions 1375; and 2532 in 1722 the world 165 to come 2064 5740 eternal 166 life 2222. 

10:31 But 1161 many 4183 [that are] first 4413 shall be 2071 5704 last 2078; and 2532 the last 2078 first 4413. 

10:32 And 1161 they were 2258 5713 in 1722 the way 3598 going up 305 5723 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414; and 2532 Jesus 2424 went 2258 5713 before 4254 5723 them 846: and 2532 they were amazed 2284 5712; and 2532 as they followed 190 5723, they were afraid 5399 5711. And 2532 he took 3880 5631 again 3825 the twelve 1427, and began 756 5662 to tell 3004 5721 them 846 what things should 3195 5723 happen 4819 5721 unto him 846, 

10:33 [Saying], 3754 Behold 2400 5628, we go up 305 5719 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414; and 2532 the Son 5207 of man 444 shall be delivered 3860 5701 unto the chief priests 749, and 2532 unto the scribes 1122; and 2532 they shall condemn 2632 5692 him 846 to death 2288, and 2532 shall deliver 3860 5692 him 846 to the Gentiles 1484: 

10:34 And 2532 they shall mock 1702 5692 him 846, and 2532 shall scourge 3146 5692 him 846, and 2532 shall spit upon 1716 5692 him 846, and 2532 shall kill 615 5692 him 846: and 2532 the third 5154 day 2250 he shall rise again 450 5698. 

10:35 And 2532 James 2385 and 2532 John 2491, the sons 5207 of Zebedee 2199, come 4365 5736 unto him 846, saying 3004 5723, Master 1320, we would 2309 5719 that 2443 thou shouldest do 4160 5661 for us 2254 whatsoever 1437 we shall desire 154 5661. 

10:36 And 1161 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, What 5101 would 2309 5719 ye that I 3165 should do 4160 5658 for you 5213? 

10:37 1161 They said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Grant 1325 5628 unto us 2254 that 2443 we may sit 2523 5661, one 1520 on 1537 thy 4675 right hand 1188, and 2532 the other 1520 on 1537 thy 4675 left hand 2176, in 1722 thy 4675 glory 1391. 

10:38 But 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Ye know 1492 5758 not 3756 what 5101 ye ask 154 5731: can ye 1410 5736 drink 4095 5629 of the cup 4221 that 3739 I 1473 drink of 4095 5719? and 2532 be baptized 907 5743 with the baptism 908 that 3739 I 1473 am baptized with 907 5683? 

10:39 And 1161 they said 2036 5627 unto him 846, We can 1410 5736. And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Ye shall 4095 0 indeed 3303 drink 4095 5719 of the cup 4221 that 3739 I 1473 drink of 4095 5695; and 2532 with the baptism 908 that 3739 I 1473 am baptized withal 907 5743 shall ye be baptized 907 5701: 

10:40 But 1161 to sit 2523 5658 on 1537 my 3450 right hand 1188 and 2532 on 1537 my 3450 left hand 2176 is 2076 5748 not 3756 mine 1699 to give 1325 5629; but 235 [it shall be given to them] for whom 3739 it is prepared 2090 5769. 

10:41 And 2532 when the ten 1176 heard 191 5660 [it], they began 756 5662 to be much displeased 23 5721 with 4012 James 2385 and 2532 John 2491. 

10:42 But 1161 Jesus 2424 called 4341 5666 them 846 [to him], and saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Ye know 1492 5758 that 3754 they which are accounted 1380 5723 to rule 757 5721 over the Gentiles 1484 exercise lordship 2634 5719 over them 846; and 2532 their 846 great ones 3173 exercise authority 2715 5719 upon them 846. 

10:43 But 1161 so 3779 shall it 2071 0 not 3756 be 2071 5704 among 1722 you 5213: but 235 whosoever 3739 1437 will 2309 5725 be 1096 5635 great 3173 among 1722 you 5213, shall be 2071 5704 your 5216 minister 1249: 

10:44 And 2532 whosoever 3739 302 of you 5216 will 2309 5725 be 1096 5635 the chiefest 4413, shall be 2071 5704 servant 1401 of all 3956. 

10:45 For 1063 even 2532 the Son 5207 of man 444 came 2064 5627 not 3756 to be ministered unto 1247 5683, but 235 to minister 1247 5658, and 2532 to give 1325 5629 his 848 life 5590 a ransom 3083 for 473 many 4183. 

10:46 And 2532 they came 2064 5736 to 1519 Jericho 2410: and 2532 as he went 1607 5740 out of 575 Jericho 2410 with 2532 his 846 disciples 3101 and 2532 a great 2425 number of people 3793, blind 5185 Bartimaeus 924, the son 5207 of Timaeus 5090, sat 2521 5711 by 3844 the highway side 3598 begging 4319 5723. 

10:47 And 2532 when he heard 191 5660 that 3754 it was 2076 5748 Jesus 2424 of Nazareth 3480, he began 756 5662 to cry out 2896 5721, and 2532 say 3004 5721, Jesus 2424, [thou] Son 5207 of David 1138, have mercy 1653 5657 on me 3165. 

10:48 And 2532 many 4183 charged 2008 5707 him 846 that 2443 he should hold his peace 4623 5661: but 1161 he cried 2896 5707 the more 3123 a great deal 4183, [Thou] Son 5207 of David 1138, have mercy 1653 5657 on me 3165. 

10:49 And 2532 Jesus 2424 stood still 2476 5631, and commanded 2036 5627 him 846 to be called 5455 5683. And 2532 they call 5455 5719 the blind man 5185, saying 3004 5723 unto him 846, Be of good comfort 2293 5720, rise 1453 5669; he calleth 5455 5719 thee 4571. 

10:50 And 1161 he, casting away 577 5631 his 848 garment 2440, rose 450 5631, and came 2064 5627 to 4314 Jesus 2424. 

10:51 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and said 3004 5719 unto him 846, What 5101 wilt 2309 5719 thou that I should do 4160 5661 unto thee 4671? 1161 The blind man 5185 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Lord 4462, that 2443 I might receive my sight 308 5661. 

10:52 And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Go thy way 5217 5720; thy 4675 faith 4102 hath made 4982 0 thee 4571 whole 4982 5758. And 2532 immediately 2112 he received his sight 308 5656, and 2532 followed 190 5707 Jesus 2424 in 1722 the way 3598. 

11:1 And 2532 when 3753 they came nigh 1448 5719 to 1519 Jerusalem 2419, unto 1519 Bethphage 967 and 2532 Bethany 963, at 4314 the mount 3735 of Olives 1636, he sendeth forth 649 5719 two 1417 of his 848 disciples 3101, 

11:2 And 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Go your way 5217 5720 into 1519 the village 2968 over against 2713 you 5216: and 2532 as soon as 2112 ye be entered 1531 5740 into 1519 it 846, ye shall find 2147 5692 a colt 4454 tied 1210 5772, whereon 1909 3739 never 3762 man 444 sat 2523 5758; loose 3089 5660 him 846, and bring 71 5628 [him]. 

11:3 And 2532 if 1437 any man 5100 say 2036 5632 unto you 5213, Why 5101 do ye 4160 5719 this 5124? say ye 2036 5628 that 3754 the Lord 2962 hath 2192 5719 need 5532 of him 846; and 2532 straightway 2112 he will send 649 5692 him 846 hither 5602. 

11:4 And 1161 they went their way 565 5627, and 2532 found 2147 5627 the colt 4454 tied 1210 5772 by 4314 the door 2374 without 1854 in 1909 a place where two ways met 296; and 2532 they loose 3089 5719 him 846. 

11:5 And 2532 certain of them 5100 that stood 2476 5761 there 1563 said 3004 5707 unto them 846, What 5101 do ye 4160 5719, loosing 3089 5723 the colt 4454? 

11:6 And 1161 they said 2036 5627 unto them 846 even as 2531 Jesus 2424 had commanded 1781 5662: and 2532 they let 863 0 them 846 go 863 5656. 

11:7 And 2532 they brought 71 5627 the colt 4454 to 4314 Jesus 2424, and 2532 cast 1911 0 their 848 garments 2440 on 1911 5627 him 846; and 2532 he sat 2523 5656 upon 1909 him 846. 

11:8 And 1161 many 4183 spread 4766 5656 their 848 garments 2440 in 1519 the way 3598: and 1161 others 243 cut down 2875 5707 branches 4746 off 1537 the trees 1186, and 2532 strawed 4766 5707 [them] in 1519 the way 3598. 

11:9 And 2532 they that went before 4254 5723, and 2532 they that followed 190 5723, cried 2896 5707, saying 3004 5723, Hosanna 5614; Blessed 2127 5772 [is] he that cometh 2064 5740 in 1722 the name 3686 of the Lord 2962: 

11:10 Blessed 2127 5772 [be] the kingdom 932 of our 2257 father 3962 David 1138, that cometh 2064 5740 in 1722 the name 3686 of the Lord 2962: Hosanna 5614 in 1722 the highest 5310. 

11:11 And 2532 Jesus 2424 entered 1525 5627 into 1519 Jerusalem 2414, and 2532 into 1519 the temple 2411: and 2532 when he had looked round about upon 4017 5671 all things 3956, and now 2235 the eventide 3798 5610 was come 5607 5752, he went out 1831 5627 unto 1519 Bethany 963 with 3326 the twelve 1427. 

11:12 And 2532 on the morrow 1887, when they 846 were come 1831 5631 from 575 Bethany 963, he was hungry 3983 5656: 

11:13 And 2532 seeing 1492 5631 a fig tree 4808 afar off 3113 having 2192 5723 leaves 5444, he came 2064 5627, if 1487 haply 686 he might find 2147 5692 any thing 5100 thereon 1722 846: and 2532 when he came 2064 5631 to 1909 it 846, he found 2147 5627 nothing 3762 but 1508 leaves 5444; for 1063 the time 2540 of figs 4810 was 2258 5713 not 3756 [yet]. 

11:14 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto it 846, No man 3367 eat 5315 5630 fruit 2590 of 1537 thee 4675 hereafter 3371 for 1519 ever 165. And 2532 his 846 disciples 3101 heard 191 5707 [it]. 

11:15 And 2532 they come 2064 5736 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414: and 2532 Jesus 2424 went 1525 5631 into 1519 the temple 2411, and began 756 5662 to cast out 1544 5721 them that sold 4453 5723 and 2532 bought 59 5723 in 1722 the temple 2411, and 2532 overthrew 2690 5656 the tables 5132 of the moneychangers 2855, and 2532 the seats 2515 of them 846 that sold 4453 5723 doves 4058; 

11:16 And 2532 would 863 0 not 3756 suffer 863 5707 that 2443 any man 5100 should carry 1308 5632 [any] vessel 4632 through 1223 the temple 2411. 

11:17 And 2532 he taught 1321 5707, saying 3004 5723 unto them 846, Is it 1125 0 not 3756 written 1125 5769, 3754 My 3450 house 3624 shall be called 2564 5701 of all 3956 nations 1484 the house 3624 of prayer 4335? but 1161 ye 5210 have made 4160 5656 it 846 a den 4693 of thieves 3027. 

11:18 And 2532 the scribes 1122 and 2532 chief priests 749 heard 191 5656 [it], and 2532 sought 2212 5707 how 4459 they might destroy 622 5692 him 846: for 1063 they feared 5399 5711 him 846, because 3754 all 3956 the people 3793 was astonished 1605 5712 at 1909 his 846 doctrine 1322. 

11:19 And 2532 when 3753 even 3796 was come 1096 5633, he went 1607 5711 out of 1854 the city 4172. 

11:20 And 2532 in the morning 4404, as they passed by 3899 5740, they saw 1492 5627 the fig tree 4808 dried up 3583 5772 from 1537 the roots 4491. 

11:21 And 2532 Peter 4074 calling to remembrance 363 5679 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Master 4461, behold 2396, the fig tree 4808 which 3739 thou cursedst 2672 5662 is withered away 3583 5769. 

11:22 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answering 611 5679 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Have 2192 5720 faith 4102 in God 2316. 

11:23 For 1063 verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 whosoever 3739 302 shall say 2036 5632 unto this 5129 mountain 3735, Be thou removed 142 5682, and 2532 be thou cast 906 5682 into 1519 the sea 2281; and 2532 shall 1252 0 not 3361 doubt 1252 5686 in 1722 his 848 heart 2588, but 235 shall believe 4100 5661 that 3754 those things which 3739 he saith 3004 5719 shall come to pass 1096 5736; he 846 shall have 2071 5704 whatsoever 3739 1437 he saith 2036 5632. 

11:24 Therefore 1223 5124 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, What 3745 things 3956 soever 302 ye desire 154 5731, when ye pray 4336 5740, believe 4100 5720 that 3754 ye receive 2983 5719 [them], and 2532 ye 5213 shall have 2071 5704 [them]. 

11:25 And 2532 when 3752 ye stand 4739 5725 praying 4336 5740, forgive 863 5720, if 1536 0 ye have 2192 5719 ought 1536 against 2596 any 5100: that 2443 your 5216 Father 3962 also 2532 which 3588 is in 1722 heaven 3772 may forgive 863 5632 you 5213 your 5216 trespasses 3900. 

11:26 But 1161 if 1487 ye 5210 do 863 0 not 3756 forgive 863 5719, neither 3761 will 863 0 your 5216 Father 3962 which 3588 is in 1722 heaven 3772 forgive 863 5692 your 5216 trespasses 3900. 

11:27 And 2532 they come 2064 5736 again 3825 to 1519 Jerusalem 2414: and 2532 as he 846 was walking 4043 5723 in 1722 the temple 2411, there come 2064 5736 to 4314 him 846 the chief priests 749, and 2532 the scribes 1122, and 2532 the elders 4245, 

11:28 And 2532 say 3004 5719 unto him 846, By 1722 what 4169 authority 1849 doest thou 4160 5719 these things 5023? and 2532 who 5101 gave 1325 5656 thee 4671 this 5026 authority 1849 to 2443 do 4160 5725 these things 5023? 

11:29 And 1161 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto them 846, I will 1905 0 also 2504 ask 1905 5692 of you 5209 one 1520 question 3056, and 2532 answer 611 5676 me 3427, and 2532 I will tell 2046 5692 you 5213 by 1722 what 4169 authority 1849 I do 4160 5719 these things 5023. 

11:30 The baptism 908 of John 2491, was 2258 5713 [it] from 1537 heaven 3772, or 2228 of 1537 men 444? answer 611 5676 me 3427. 

11:31 And 2532 they reasoned 3049 5711 with 4314 themselves 1438, saying 3004 5723, If 1437 we shall say 2036 5632, From 1537 heaven 3772; he will say 2046 5692, Why 1302 then 3767 did ye 4100 0 not 3756 believe 4100 5656 him 846? 

11:32 But 235 if 1437 we shall say 2036 5632, Of 1537 men 444; they feared 5399 5711 the people 2992: for 1063 all 537 [men] counted 2192 5707 John 2491, that 3754 he was 2258 5713 a prophet 4396 indeed 3689. 

11:33 And 2532 they answered 611 5679 and said 3004 5719 unto Jesus 2424, We 1492 0 cannot 3756 tell 1492 5758. And 2532 Jesus 2424 answering 611 5679 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Neither 3761 do I 1473 tell 3004 5719 you 5213 by 1722 what 4169 authority 1849 I do 4160 5719 these things 5023. 

12:1 And 2532 he began 756 5662 to speak 3004 5721 unto them 846 by 1722 parables 3850. A [certain] man 444 planted 5452 5656 a vineyard 290, and 2532 set 4060 5656 an hedge about 5418 [it], and 2532 digged 3736 5656 [a place for] the winefat 5276, and 2532 built 3618 5656 a tower 4444, and 2532 let 1554 0 it 846 out 1554 5639 to husbandmen 1092, and 2532 went into a far country 589 5656. 

12:2 And 2532 at the season 2540 he sent 649 5656 to 4314 the husbandmen 1092 a servant 1401, that 2443 he might receive 2983 5632 from 3844 the husbandmen 1092 of 575 the fruit 2590 of the vineyard 290. 

12:3 And 1161 they caught 2983 5631 [him], and beat 1194 5656 him 846, and 2532 sent [him] away 649 5656 empty 2756. 

12:4 And 2532 again 3825 he sent 649 5656 unto 4314 them 846 another 243 servant 1401; and at him 2548 they cast stones 3036 5660, and wounded [him] in the head 2775 5656, and 2532 sent [him] away 649 5656 shamefully handled 821 5772. 

12:5 And 2532 again 3825 he sent 649 5656 another 243; and him 2548 they killed 615 5656, and 2532 many 4183 others 243; 3303 beating some 1194 5723, and 1161 killing some 615 5723. 

12:6 Having 2192 5723 yet 2089 therefore 3767 one 1520 son 5207, his 848 wellbeloved 27, he sent 649 5656 him 846 also 2532 last 2078 unto 4314 them 846, saying 3004 5723, 3754 They will reverence 1788 5691 my 3450 son 5207. 

12:7 But 1161 those 1565 husbandmen 1092 said 2036 5627 among 4314 themselves 1438, This 3754 3778 is 2076 5748 the heir 2818; come 1205 5773, let us kill 615 5725 him 846, and 2532 the inheritance 2817 shall be 2071 5704 ours 2257. 

12:8 And 2532 they took 2983 5631 him 846, and killed 615 5656 [him], and 2532 cast 1544 5627 [him] out of 1854 the vineyard 290. 

12:9 What 5101 shall 4160 0 therefore 3767 the lord 2962 of the vineyard 290 do 4160 5692? he will come 2064 5695 and 2532 destroy 622 5692 the husbandmen 1092, and 2532 will give 1325 5692 the vineyard 290 unto others 243. 

12:10 And have ye 314 0 not 3761 read 314 5627 this 5026 scripture 1124; The stone 3037 which 3739 the builders 3618 5723 rejected 593 5656 is 3778 1096 5675 become 1519 the head 2776 of the corner 1137: 

12:11 This 3778 was 1096 0 the Lord's 2962 doing 1096 5633 3844, and 2532 it is 2076 5748 marvellous 2298 in 1722 our 2257 eyes 3788? 

12:12 And 2532 they sought 2212 5707 to lay hold 2902 5658 on him 846, but 2532 feared 5399 5675 the people 3793: for 1063 they knew 1097 5627 that 3754 he had spoken 2036 5627 the parable 3850 against 4314 them 846: and 2532 they left 863 5631 him 846, and went their way 565 5627. 

12:13 And 2532 they send 649 5719 unto 4314 him 846 certain 5100 of the Pharisees 5330 and 2532 of the Herodians 2265, to 2443 catch 64 5661 him 846 in [his] words 3056. 

12:14 And 1161 when they were come 2064 5631, they say 3004 5719 unto him 846, Master 1320, we know 1492 5758 that 3754 thou art 1488 5748 true 227, and 2532 4671 carest 3756 3199 5719 for 4012 no man 3762: for 1063 thou regardest 991 5719 not 3756 the person 1519 4383 of men 444, but 235 teachest 1321 5719 the way 3598 of God 2316 in 1909 truth 225: Is it lawful 1832 5748 to give 1325 5629 tribute 2778 to Caesar 2541, or 2228 not 3756? 

12:15 Shall we give 1325 5632, or 2228 shall we not 3361 give 1325 5632? But 1161 he, knowing 1492 5761 their 846 hypocrisy 5272, said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Why 5101 tempt ye 3985 5719 me 3165? bring 5342 5720 me 3427 a penny 1220, that 2443 I may see 1492 5632 [it]. 

12:16 And 1161 they brought 5342 5656 [it]. And 2532 he saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Whose 5101 [is] this 3778 image 1504 and 2532 superscription 1923? And 1161 they said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Caesar's 2541. 

12:17 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Render 591 5628 to Caesar 2541 the things that are 3588 Caesar's 2541, and 2532 to God 2316 the things that are 3588 God's 2316. And 2532 they marvelled 2296 5656 at 1909 him 846. 

12:18 Then 2532 come 2064 5736 unto 4314 him 846 the Sadducees 4523, which 3748 say 3004 5719 there is 1511 5750 no 3361 resurrection 386; and 2532 they asked 1905 5656 him 846, saying 3004 5723, 

12:19 Master 1320, Moses 3475 wrote 1125 5656 unto us 2254, If 3754 1437 a man's 5100 brother 80 die 599 5632, and 2532 leave 2641 5632 [his] wife 1135 [behind him], and 2532 leave 863 5632 no 3361 children 5043, that 2443 his 846 brother 80 should take 2983 5632 his 846 wife 1135, and 2532 raise up 1817 5661 seed 4690 unto his 848 brother 80. 

12:20 Now there were 2258 5713 seven 2033 brethren 80: and 2532 the first 4413 took 2983 5627 a wife 1135, and 2532 dying 599 5723 left 863 5656 no 3756 seed 4690. 

12:21 And 2532 the second 1208 took 2983 5627 her 846, and 2532 died 599 5627, 2532 neither 3761 left 863 5656 he 846 any seed 4690: and 2532 the third 5154 likewise 5615. 

12:22 And 2532 the seven 2033 had 2983 5627 her 846, and 2532 left 863 5656 no 3756 seed 4690: last 2078 of all 3956 the woman 1135 died 599 5627 also 2532. 

12:23 In 1722 the resurrection 386 therefore 3767, when 3752 they shall rise 450 5632, whose 5101 wife 1135 shall she be 2071 5704 of them 846? for 1063 the seven 2033 had 2192 5627 her 846 to wife 1135. 

12:24 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Do ye 4105 0 not 3756 therefore 1223 5124 err 4105 5743, because ye know 1492 5761 not 3361 the scriptures 1124, neither 3366 the power 1411 of God 2316? 

12:25 For 1063 when 3752 they shall rise 450 5632 from 1537 the dead 3498, they neither 3777 marry 1060 5719, nor 3777 are given in marriage 1061 5743; but 235 are 1526 5748 as 5613 the angels 32 which 3588 are in 1722 heaven 3772. 

12:26 And 1161 as touching 4012 the dead 3498, that 3754 they rise 1453 5743: have ye 314 0 not 3756 read 314 5627 in 1722 the book 976 of Moses 3475, how 5613 in 1909 the bush 942 God 2316 spake 2036 5627 unto him 846, saying 3004 5723, I 1473 [am] the God 2316 of Abraham 11, and 2532 the God 2316 of Isaac 2464, and 2532 the God 2316 of Jacob 2384? 

12:27 He is 2076 5748 not 3756 the God 2316 of the dead 3498, but 235 the God 2316 of the living 2198 5723: ye 5210 therefore 3767 do 4105 0 greatly 4183 err 4105 5743. 

12:28 And 2532 one 1520 of the scribes 1122 came 4334 5631, and having heard 191 5660 them 846 reasoning together 4802 5723, and perceiving 1492 5761 that 3754 he had answered 611 5662 them 846 well 2573, asked 1905 5656 him 846, Which 4169 is 2076 5748 the first 4413 commandment 1785 of all 3956? 

12:29 And 1161 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5662 him 846, The 3754 first 4413 of all 3956 the commandments 1785 [is], Hear 191 5720, O Israel 2474; The Lord 2962 our 2257 God 2316 is 2076 5748 one 1520 Lord 2962: 

12:30 And 2532 thou shalt love 25 5692 the Lord 2962 thy 4675 God 2316 with 1537 all 3650 thy 4675 heart 2588, and 2532 with 1537 all 3650 thy 4675 soul 5590, and 2532 with 1537 all 3650 thy 4675 mind 1271, and 2532 with 1537 all 3650 thy 4675 strength 2479: this 3778 [is] the first 4413 commandment 1785. 

12:31 And 2532 the second 1208 [is] like 3664, [namely] this 3778, Thou shalt love 25 5692 thy 4675 neighbour 4139 as 5613 thyself 4572. There is 2076 5748 none 3756 other 243 commandment 1785 greater 3187 than these 5130. 

12:32 And 2532 the scribe 1122 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Well 2573, Master 1320, thou hast said 2036 5627 the 1909 truth 225: for 3754 there is 2076 5748 one 1520 God 2316; and 2532 there is 2076 5748 none 3756 other 243 but 4133 he 846: 

12:33 And 2532 to love 25 5721 him 846 with 1537 all 3650 the heart 2588, and 2532 with 1537 all 3650 the understanding 4907, and 2532 with 1537 all 3650 the soul 5590, and 2532 with 1537 all 3650 the strength 2479, and 2532 to love 25 5721 [his] neighbour 4139 as 5613 himself 1438, is 2076 5748 more 4119 than all 3956 whole burnt offerings 3646 and 2532 sacrifices 2378. 

12:34 And 2532 when Jesus 2424 saw 1492 5631 that 3754 he answered 611 5662 discreetly 3562, he said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Thou art 1488 5748 not 3756 far 3112 from 575 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. And 2532 no man 3762 after that 3765 durst 5111 5707 ask 1905 5658 him 846 [any question]. 

12:35 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and said 3004 5707, while he taught 1321 5723 in 1722 the temple 2411, How 4459 say 3004 5719 the scribes 1122 that 3754 Christ 5547 is 2076 5748 the Son 5207 of David 1138? 

12:36 For 1063 David 1138 himself 846 said 2036 5627 by 1722 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151, The LORD 2962 said 2036 5627 to my 3450 Lord 2962, Sit thou 2521 5737 on 1537 my 3450 right hand 1188, till 2193 302 I make 5087 5632 thine 4675 enemies 2190 thy 4675 footstool 5286 4228. 

12:37 David 1138 therefore 3767 himself 846 calleth 3004 5719 him 846 Lord 2962; and 2532 whence 4159 is he 2076 5748 [then] his 846 son 5207? And 2532 the common 4183 people 3793 heard 191 5707 him 846 gladly 2234. 

12:38 And 2532 he said 3004 5707 unto them 846 in 1722 his 848 doctrine 1322, Beware 991 5720 of 575 the scribes 1122, which 3588 love 2309 5723 to go 4043 5721 in 1722 long clothing 4749, and 2532 [love] salutations 783 in 1722 the marketplaces 58, 

12:39 And 2532 the chief seats 4410 in 1722 the synagogues 4864, and 2532 the uppermost rooms 4411 at 1722 feasts 1173: 

12:40 Which 3739 devour 2719 5723 widows 5503' houses 3614, and 2532 for a pretence 4392 make 4336 0 long 3117 prayers 4336 5740: these 3778 shall receive 2983 5695 greater 4055 damnation 2917. 

12:41 And 2532 Jesus 2424 sat 2523 5660 over against 2713 the treasury 1049, and beheld 2334 5707 how 4459 the people 3793 cast 906 5719 money 5475 into 1519 the treasury 1049: and 2532 many 4183 that were rich 4145 cast in 906 5707 much 4183. 

12:42 And 2532 there came 2064 5631 a certain 3391 poor 4434 widow 5503, and she threw in 906 5627 two 1417 mites 3016, which 3603 make 2076 5748 a farthing 2835. 

12:43 And 2532 he called 4341 5666 [unto him] his 848 disciples 3101, and saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, That 3754 this 3778 poor 4434 widow 5503 hath cast 906 0 more 4119 in 906 5758, than all 3956 they which have cast 906 5631 into 1519 the treasury 1049: 

12:44 For 1063 all 3956 [they] did cast in 906 5627 of 1537 their 846 abundance 4052 5723; but 1161 she 3778 of 1537 her 848 want 5304 did cast in 906 5627 all 3956 that 3745 she had 2192 5707, [even] all 3650 her 848 living 979. 

13:1 And 2532 as he went 1607 5740 out of 1537 the temple 2411, one 1520 of his 846 disciples 3101 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Master 1320, see 2396 what manner 4217 of stones 3037 and 2532 what 4217 buildings 3619 [are here]! 

13:2 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Seest thou 991 5719 these 5025 great 3173 buildings 3619? there shall 863 0 not 3364 be left 863 5686 one stone 3037 upon 1909 another 3037, that 3739 shall 2647 0 not 3364 be thrown down 2647 5686. 

13:3 And 2532 as he sat 2521 5740 upon 1519 the mount 3735 of Olives 1636 over against 2713 the temple 2411, Peter 4074 and 2532 James 2385 and 2532 John 2491 and 2532 Andrew 406 asked 1905 5707 him 846 privately 2596 2398, 

13:4 Tell 2036 5628 us 2254, when 4219 shall these things 5023 be 2071 5704? and 2532 what 5101 [shall be] the sign 4592 when 3752 all 3956 these things 5023 shall 3195 5725 be fulfilled 4931 5745? 

13:5 And 1161 Jesus 2424 answering 611 5679 them 846 began 756 5662 to say 3004 5721, Take heed 991 5720 lest 3361 any 5100 [man] deceive 4105 5661 you 5209: 

13:6 For 1063 many 4183 shall come 2064 5695 in 1909 my 3450 name 3686, saying 3004 5723, 3754 I 1473 am 1510 5748 [Christ]; and 2532 shall deceive 4105 5692 many 4183. 

13:7 And 1161 when 3752 ye shall hear 191 5661 of wars 4171 and 2532 rumours 189 of wars 4171, be ye 2360 0 not 3361 troubled 2360 5744: for 1063 [such things] must 1163 5748 needs be 1096 5635; but 235 the end 5056 [shall] not [be] yet 3768. 

13:8 For 1063 nation 1484 shall rise 1453 5701 against 1909 nation 1484, and 2532 kingdom 932 against 1909 kingdom 932: and 2532 there shall be 2071 5704 earthquakes 4578 in divers 2596 places 5117, and 2532 there shall be 2071 5704 famines 3042 and 2532 troubles 5016: these 5023 [are] the beginnings 746 of sorrows 5604. 

13:9 But 1161 take heed 5210 991 5720 to yourselves 1438: for 1063 they shall deliver 3860 0 you 5209 up 3860 5692 to 1519 councils 4892; and 2532 in 1519 the synagogues 4864 ye shall be beaten 1194 5691: and 2532 ye shall be brought 2476 5701 5625 71 5701 before 1909 rulers 2232 and 2532 kings 935 for my 1700 sake 1752, for 1519 a testimony 3142 against them 846. 

13:10 And 2532 the gospel 2098 must 1163 5748 first 4412 be published 2784 5683 among 1519 all 3956 nations 1484. 

13:11 But 1161 when 3752 they shall lead 71 5632 [you], and deliver 3860 0 you 5209 up 3860 5723, take 4305 0 no 3361 thought beforehand 4305 5720 what 5101 ye shall speak 2980 5661, neither 3366 do ye premeditate 3191 5720: but 235 whatsoever 3739 shall be 1437 given 1325 5686 you 5213 in 1722 that 1565 hour 5610, that 5124 speak 2980 5720 ye: for 1063 it is 2075 5748 not 3756 ye 5210 that speak 2980 5723, but 235 the Holy 40 Ghost 4151. 

13:12 Now 1161 the brother 80 shall betray 3860 5692 the brother 80 to 1519 death 2288, and 2532 the father 3962 the son 5043; and 2532 children 5043 shall rise up 1881 5695 against 1909 [their] parents 1118, and 2532 shall cause 2289 0 them 846 to be put to death 2289 5692. 

13:13 And 2532 ye shall be 2071 5704 hated 3404 5746 of 5259 all 3956 [men] for 1223 0 my 3450 name's sake 1223 3686: but 1161 he that shall endure 5278 5660 unto 1519 the end 5056, the same 3778 shall be saved 4982 5701. 

13:14 But 1161 when 3752 ye shall see 1492 5632 the abomination 946 of desolation 2050, spoken 4483 5685 of by 5259 Daniel 1158 the prophet 4396, standing 2476 5756 5625 2476 5761 where 3699 it ought 1163 5748 not 3756, (let him that readeth 314 5723 understand 3539 5720) then 5119 let them 5343 0 that be in 1722 Judaea 2449 flee 5343 5720 to 1519 the mountains 3735: 

13:15 And 1161 let him 2597 0 that is on 1909 the housetop 1430 not 3361 go down 2597 5628 into 1519 the house 3614, neither 3366 enter 1525 5628 [therein], to take 142 5658 any thing 5100 out of 1537 his 848 house 3614: 

13:16 And 2532 let 1994 0 him that is 5607 5752 in 1519 the field 68 not 3361 turn 1519 1994 0 back 3694 again 1994 5657 for to take up 142 5658 his 848 garment 2440. 

13:17 But 1161 woe 3759 to them that are 2192 5723 with 1722 child 1064, and 2532 to them that give suck 2337 5723 in 1722 those 1565 days 2250! 

13:18 And 1161 pray ye 4336 5737 that 3363 0 your 5216 flight 5437 be 1096 5638 not 3363 in the winter 5494. 

13:19 For 1063 [in] those 1565 days 2250 shall be 2071 5704 affliction 2347, such 5108 as 3634 was 1096 5754 not 3756 from 575 the beginning 746 of the creation 2937 which 3739 God 2316 created 2936 5656 unto 2193 this time 3568, neither 2532 3364 shall be 1096 5638. 

13:20 And 2532 except 1508 that the Lord 2962 had shortened 2856 5656 those days 2250, no 3756 3956 flesh 4561 should be 302 saved 4982 5681: but 235 for 1223 the elect's sake 1588, whom 3739 he hath chosen 1586 5668, he hath shortened 2856 5656 the days 2250. 

13:21 And 2532 then 5119 if 1437 any man 5100 shall say 2036 5632 to you 5213, Lo 2400 5628, here 5602 [is] Christ 5547; or 2228, lo 2400 5628, [he is] there 1563; believe 4100 5661 [him] not 3361: 

13:22 For 1063 false Christs 5580 and 2532 false prophets 5578 shall rise 1453 5701, and 2532 shall shew 1325 5692 signs 4592 and 2532 wonders 5059, to 4314 seduce 635 5721, if 1487 [it were] possible 1415, even 2532 the elect 1588. 

13:23 But 1161 take 991 0 ye 5210 heed 991 5720: behold 2400 5628, I have foretold 4280 5758 you 5213 all things 3956. 

13:24 But 235 in 1722 those 1565 days 2250, after 3326 that 1565 tribulation 2347, the sun 2246 shall be darkened 4654 5701, and 2532 the moon 4582 shall 1325 0 not 3756 give 1325 5692 her 848 light 5338, 

13:25 And 2532 the stars 792 of heaven 3772 shall 2071 5704 fall 1601 5723, and 2532 the powers 1411 that are in 1722 heaven 3772 shall be shaken 4531 5701. 

13:26 And 2532 then 5119 shall they see 3700 5695 the Son 5207 of man 444 coming 2064 5740 in 1722 the clouds 3507 with 3326 great 4183 power 1411 and 2532 glory 1391. 

13:27 And 2532 then 5119 shall he send 649 5692 his 848 angels 32, and 2532 shall gather together 1996 5692 his 848 elect 1588 from 1537 the four 5064 winds 417, from 575 the uttermost part 206 of the earth 1093 to 2193 the uttermost part 206 of heaven 3772. 

13:28 Now 1161 learn 3129 5628 a parable 3850 of 575 the fig tree 4808; When 3752 her 846 branch 2798 is 1096 5638 yet 2235 tender 527, and 2532 putteth forth 1631 5725 leaves 5444, ye know 1097 5719 that 3754 summer 2330 is 2076 5748 near 1451: 

13:29 So 3779 ye 5210 in like manner 2532, when 3752 ye shall see 1492 5632 these things 5023 come to pass 1096 5740, know 1097 5720 that 3754 it is 2076 5748 nigh 1451, [even] at 1909 the doors 2374. 

13:30 Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, that 3754 this 3778 generation 1074 shall 3928 0 not 3364 pass 3928 5632, till 3360 3739 all 3956 these things 5023 be done 1096 5638. 

13:31 Heaven 3772 and 2532 earth 1093 shall pass away 3928 5695: but 1161 my 3450 words 3056 shall 3928 0 not 3364 pass away 3928 5632. 

13:32 But 1161 of 4012 that 1565 day 2250 and 2532 [that] hour 5610 knoweth 1492 5758 no man 3762, no, not 3761 the angels 32 which 3588 are in 1722 heaven 3772, neither 3761 the Son 5207, but 1508 the Father 3962. 

13:33 Take ye heed 991 5720, watch 69 5720 and 2532 pray 4336 5737: for 1063 ye know 1492 5758 not 3756 when 4219 the time 2540 is 2076 5748. 

13:34 [For the Son of man is] as 5613 a man 444 taking a far journey 590, who left 863 5631 his 848 house 3614, and 2532 gave 1325 5631 authority 1849 to his 848 servants 1401, and 2532 to every man 1538 his 848 work 2041, and 2532 commanded 1781 5662 the porter 2377 to 2443 watch 1127 5725. 

13:35 Watch ye 1127 5720 therefore 3767: for 1063 ye know 1492 5758 not 3756 when 4219 the master 2962 of the house 3614 cometh 2064 5736, at even 3796, or 2228 at midnight 3317, or 2228 at the cockcrowing 219, or 2228 in the morning 4404: 

13:36 Lest 3361 coming 2064 5631 suddenly 1810 he find 2147 5632 you 5209 sleeping 2518 5723. 

13:37 And 1161 what 3739 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213 I say 3004 5719 unto all 3956, Watch 1127 5720. 

14:1 After 1161 two 1417 days 2250 was 2258 5713 [the feast of] the passover 3957, and 2532 of 3326 unleavened bread 106: and 2532 the chief priests 749 and 2532 the scribes 1122 sought 2212 5707 how 4459 they might take 2902 5660 him 846 by 1722 craft 1388, and put [him] to death 615 5725. 

14:2 But 1161 they said 3004 5707, Not 3361 on 1722 the feast 1859 [day], lest 3379 there be 2071 5704 an uproar 2351 of the people 2992. 

14:3 And 2532 being 846 5607 5752 in 1722 Bethany 963 in 1722 the house 3614 of Simon 4613 the leper 3015, as he 846 sat at meat 2621 5740, there came 2064 5627 a woman 1135 having 2192 5723 an alabaster box 211 of ointment 3464 of spikenard 3487 4101 very precious 4185; and 2532 she brake 4937 5660 the box 211, and poured 2708 5656 [it] on 2596 his 846 head 2776. 

14:4 And 1161 there were 2258 5713 some 5100 that had indignation 23 5723 within 4314 themselves 1438, and 2532 said 3004 5723, Why 1519 5101 was 1096 0 this 3778 waste 684 of the ointment 3464 made 1096 5754? 

14:5 For 1063 it 5124 might 1410 5711 have been sold 4097 5683 for more than 1883 three hundred 5145 pence 1220, and 2532 have been given 1325 5683 to the poor 4434. And 2532 they murmured against 1690 5711 her 846. 

14:6 And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627, Let 863 0 her 846 alone 863 5628; why 5101 trouble ye 2873 3930 5719 her 846? she hath wrought 2038 5662 a good 2570 work 2041 on 1519 me 1691. 

14:7 For 1063 ye have 2192 5719 the poor 4434 with 3326 you 1438 always 3842, and 2532 whensoever 3752 ye will 2309 5725 ye may 1410 5736 do 4160 5658 them 846 good 2095: but 1161 me 1691 ye have 2192 5719 not 3756 always 3842. 

14:8 She hath done 4160 5656 what 3739 she 3778 could 2192 5707: she is come aforehand 4301 5627 to anoint 3462 5658 my 3450 body 4983 to 1519 the burying 1780. 

14:9 Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, Wheresoever 3699 302 this 5124 gospel 2098 shall be preached 2784 5686 throughout 1519 the whole 3650 world 2889, [this] also 2532 that she 3778 hath done 4160 5656 shall be spoken 2980 5701 of for 1519 a memorial 3422 of her 846. 

14:10 And 2532 Judas 2455 Iscariot 2469, one 1520 of the twelve 1427, went 565 5627 unto 4314 the chief priests 749, to 2443 betray 3860 5632 him 846 unto them 846. 

14:11 And 1161 when they heard 191 5660 [it], they were glad 5463 5644, and 2532 promised 1861 5673 to give 1325 5629 him 846 money 694. And 2532 he sought 2212 5707 how 4459 he might conveniently 2122 betray 3860 5632 him 846. 

14:12 And 2532 the first 4413 day 2250 of unleavened bread 106, when 3753 they killed 2380 5707 the passover 3957, his 846 disciples 3101 said 3004 5719 unto him 846, Where 4226 wilt thou 2309 5719 that we go 565 5631 and prepare 2090 5661 that 2443 thou mayest eat 5315 5632 the passover 3957? 

14:13 And 2532 he sendeth forth 649 5719 two 1417 of his 848 disciples 3101, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Go ye 5217 5720 into 1519 the city 4172, and 2532 there shall meet 528 5692 you 5213 a man 444 bearing 941 5723 a pitcher 2765 of water 5204: follow 190 5657 him 846. 

14:14 And 2532 wheresoever 3699 1437 he shall go in 1525 5632, say ye 2036 5628 to the goodman of the house 3617, 3754 The Master 1320 saith 3004 5719, Where 4226 is 2076 5748 the guestchamber 2646, where 3699 I shall eat 5315 5632 the passover 3957 with 3326 my 3450 disciples 3101? 

14:15 And 2532 he 846 will shew 1166 5692 you 5213 a large 3173 upper room 508 furnished 4766 5772 [and] prepared 2092: there 1563 make ready 2090 5657 for us 2254. 

14:16 And 2532 his 846 disciples 3101 went forth 1831 5627, and 2532 came 2064 5627 into 1519 the city 4172, and 2532 found 2147 5627 as 2531 he had said 2036 5627 unto them 846: and 2532 they made ready 2090 5656 the passover 3957. 

14:17 And 2532 in 1096 5637 the evening 3798 he cometh 2064 5736 with 3326 the twelve 1427. 

14:18 And 2532 as they 846 sat 345 5740 and 2532 did eat 2068 5723, Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, 3754 One 1520 of 1537 you 5216 which 3588 eateth 2068 5723 with 3326 me 1700 shall betray 3860 5692 me 3165. 

14:19 And 1161 they began 756 5662 to be sorrowful 3076 5745, and to 2532 say 3004 5721 unto him 846 one by one 1527, 3385 [Is] it I 1473? and 2532 another 243 [said, 3385 Is] it I 1473? 

14:20 And 1161 he answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto them 846, [It is] one 1520 of 1537 the twelve 1427, that dippeth 1686 5734 with 3326 me 1700 in 1519 the dish 5165. 

14:21 The Son 5207 of man 444 indeed 3303 goeth 5217 5719, as 2531 it is written 1125 5769 of 4012 him 846: but 1161 woe 3759 to that 1565 man 444 by 1223 whom 3739 the Son 5207 of man 444 is betrayed 3860 5743! good 2570 were it 2258 5713 for that 1565 man 444 if 1487 he 846 had 1080 0 never 3756 been born 1080 5681. 

14:22 And 2532 as they 846 did eat 2068 5723, Jesus 2424 took 2983 5631 bread 740, and blessed 2127 5660, and brake 2806 5656 [it], and 2532 gave 1325 5656 to them 846, and 2532 said 2036 5627, Take 2983 5628, eat 5315 5628: this 5124 is 2076 5748 my 3450 body 4983. 

14:23 And 2532 he took 2983 5631 the cup 4221, and when he had given thanks 2168 5660, he gave 1325 5656 [it] to them 846: and 2532 they all 3956 drank 4095 5627 of 1537 it 846. 

14:24 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, This 5124 is 2076 5748 my 3450 blood 129 of the new 2537 testament 1242, which 3588 is shed 1632 5746 for 4012 many 4183. 

14:25 Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto you 5213, I will 3364 drink 4095 5632 no more 3754 3765 of 1537 the fruit 1081 of the vine 288, until 2193 that 1565 day 2250 that 3752 I drink 4095 5725 it 846 new 2537 in 1722 the kingdom 932 of God 2316. 

14:26 And 2532 when they had sung an hymn 5214 5660, they went out 1831 5627 into 1519 the mount 3735 of Olives 1636. 

14:27 And 2532 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, 3754 All ye 3956 shall be offended 4624 5701 because of 1722 me 1722 1698 this 5026 night 3571: for 3754 it is written 1125 5769, I will smite 3960 5692 the shepherd 4166, and 2532 the sheep 4263 shall be scattered 1287 5701. 

14:28 But 235 after 3326 that I 3165 am risen 1453 5683, I will go before 4254 5692 you 5209 into 1519 Galilee 1056. 

14:29 But 1161 Peter 4074 said 5346 5713 unto him 846, Although 2532 1487 all 3956 shall be offended 4624 5701, yet 235 [will] not 3756 I 1473. 

14:30 And 2532 Jesus 2424 saith 3004 5719 unto him 846, Verily 281 I say 3004 5719 unto thee 4671, That 3754 this day 4594, [even] in 1722 this 5026 night 3571, before 4250 2228 the cock 220 crow 5455 5658 twice 1364, thou shalt deny 533 5695 me 3165 thrice 5151. 

14:31 But 1161 he spake 3004 5707 the more 3123 vehemently 1537 4053, If 1437 I 3165 should 1163 5753 die with 4880 5629 thee 4671, I will not 3364 0 deny 533 5695 thee 4571 in any wise 3364. Likewise 5615 also 1161 2532 said they 3004 5707 all 3956. 

14:32 And 2532 they came 2064 5736 to 1519 a place 5564 which 3739 was named 3686 Gethsemane 1068: and 2532 he saith 3004 5719 to his 848 disciples 3101, Sit ye 2523 5657 here 5602, while 2193 I shall pray 4336 5667. 

14:33 And 2532 he taketh 3880 5719 with 3326 him 1438 Peter 4074 and 2532 James 2385 and 2532 John 2491, and 2532 began 756 5662 to be sore amazed 1568 5745, and 2532 to be very heavy 85 5721; 

14:34 And 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, My 3450 soul 5590 is 2076 5748 exceeding sorrowful 4036 unto 2193 death 2288: tarry ye 3306 5657 here 5602, and 2532 watch 1127 5720. 

14:35 And 2532 he went forward 4281 5631 a little 3397, and fell 4098 5627 on 1909 the ground 1093, and 2532 prayed 4336 5711 that 2443, if 1487 it were 2076 5748 possible 1415, the hour 5610 might pass 3928 5632 from 575 him 846. 

14:36 And 2532 he said 3004 5707, Abba 5, Father 3962, all things 3956 [are] possible 1415 unto thee 4671; take away 3911 5628 this 5124 cup 4221 from 575 me 1700: nevertheless 235 not 3756 what 5101 I 1473 will 2309 5719, but 235 what 5101 thou 4771 wilt. 

14:37 And 2532 he cometh 2064 5736, and 2532 findeth 2147 5719 them 846 sleeping 2518 5723, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto Peter 4074, Simon 4613, sleepest thou 2518 5719? couldest 2480 5656 not 3756 thou watch 1127 5658 one 3391 hour 5610? 

14:38 Watch ye 1127 5720 and 2532 pray 4336 5737, lest 3363 ye enter 1525 5632 into 1519 temptation 3986. The spirit 4151 truly 3303 [is] ready 4289, but 1161 the flesh 4561 [is] weak 772. 

14:39 And 2532 again 3825 he went away 565 5631, and prayed 4336 5662, and spake 2036 5631 the same 846 words 3056. 

14:40 And 2532 when he returned 5290 5660, he found 2147 5627 them 846 asleep 2518 5723 again 3825, (for 1063 their 846 eyes 3788 were 2258 5713 heavy 916 5772) neither 2532 3756 wist they 1492 5715 what 5101 to answer 611 5680 him 846. 

14:41 And 2532 he cometh 2064 5736 the third time 5154, and 2532 saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Sleep on 2518 5719 5720 now 3063, and 2532 take [your] rest 373 5731 5732: it is enough 566 5719, the hour 5610 is come 2064 5627; behold 2400 5628, the Son 5207 of man 444 is betrayed 3860 5743 into 1519 the hands 5495 of sinners 268. 

14:42 Rise up 1453 5728, let us go 71 5725; lo 2400 5628, he that betrayeth 3860 5723 me 3165 is at hand 1448 5758. 

14:43 And 2532 immediately 2112, while he yet 2089 spake 2980 5723, cometh 3854 5736 Judas 2455, one 1520 5607 5752 of the twelve 1427, and 2532 with 3326 him 846 a great 4183 multitude 3793 with 3326 swords 3162 and 2532 staves 3586, from 3844 the chief priests 749 and 2532 the scribes 1122 and 2532 the elders 4245. 

14:44 And 1161 he that betrayed 3860 5723 him 846 had given 1325 5715 them 846 a token 4953, saying 3004 5723, Whomsoever 3739 302 I shall kiss 5368 5661, that same 846 is he 2076 5748; take 2902 5657 him 846, and 2532 lead [him] away 520 5628 safely 806. 

14:45 And 2532 as soon as he was come 2064 5631, he goeth 4334 5631 straightway 2112 to him 846, and saith 3004 5719, Master 4461, master 4461; and 2532 kissed 2705 5656 him 846. 

14:46 And 1161 they laid 1911 5627 their 848 hands 5495 on 1909 him 846, and 2532 took 2902 5656 him 846. 

14:47 And 1161 one 5100 of them 1520 that stood by 3936 5761 drew 4685 5671 a sword 3162, and smote 3817 5656 a servant 1401 of the high priest 749, and 2532 cut off 851 5627 his 846 ear 5621. 

14:48 And 2532 Jesus 2424 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Are ye come out 1831 5627, as 5613 against 1909 a thief 3027, with 3326 swords 3162 and 2532 [with] staves 3586 to take 4815 5629 me 3165? 

14:49 I was 2252 5713 daily 2250 2596 with 4314 you 5209 in 1722 the temple 2411 teaching 1321 5723, and 2532 ye took 2902 5656 me 3165 not 3756: but 235 the scriptures 1124 must 2443 be fulfilled 4137 5686. 

14:50 And 2532 they all 3956 forsook 863 5631 him 846, and fled 5343 5627. 

14:51 And 2532 there followed 190 5707 him 846 a 1520 certain 5100 young man 3495, having a linen cloth 4616 cast 4016 5772 about 1909 [his] naked 1131 [body]; and 2532 the young men 3495 laid hold 2902 5719 on him 846: 

14:52 And 1161 he left 2641 5631 the linen cloth 4616, and fled 5343 5627 from 575 them 846 naked 1131. 

14:53 And 2532 they led 520 0 Jesus 2424 away 520 5627 to 4314 the high priest 749: and 2532 with him 846 were assembled 4905 5736 all 3956 the chief priests 749 and 2532 the elders 4245 and 2532 the scribes 1122. 

14:54 And 2532 Peter 4074 followed 190 5656 him 846 afar 3113 off 575, even 2193 into 2080 1519 the palace 833 of the high priest 749: and 2532 he sat 2258 5713 4775 5740 with 3326 the servants 5257, and 2532 warmed himself 2328 5734 at 4314 the fire 5457. 

14:55 And 1161 the chief priests 749 and 2532 all 3650 the council 4892 sought 2212 5707 for witness 3141 against 2596 Jesus 2424 to 1519 put 2289 0 him 846 to death 2289 5658; and 2532 found 2147 5707 none 3756. 

14:56 For 1063 many 4183 bare false witness 5576 5707 against 2596 him 846, but 2532 their witness 3141 agreed 2258 0 not 2470 3756 together 2258 5713. 

14:57 And 2532 there arose 450 5631 certain 5100, and bare false witness 5576 5707 against 2596 him 846, saying 3004 5723, 

14:58 3754 We 2249 heard 191 5656 him 846 say 3004 5723, 3754 I 1473 will destroy 2647 5692 this 5126 temple 3485 that is made with hands 5499, and 2532 within 1223 three 5140 days 2250 I will build 3618 5692 another 243 made without hands 886. 

14:59 But 2532 neither 3761 so 3779 did 2470 0 their witness 3141 agree together 2258 5713 2470. 

14:60 And 2532 the high priest 749 stood up 450 5631 in 1519 the midst 3319, and asked 1905 5656 Jesus 2424, saying 3004 5723, Answerest 3756 thou 611 5736 nothing 3762? what 5101 [is it which] these 3778 witness 2649 5719 against thee 4675? 

14:61 But 1161 he held his peace 4623 5707, and 2532 answered 611 5662 nothing 3762. Again 3825 the high priest 749 asked 1905 5707 him 846, and 2532 said 3004 5719 unto him 846, Art 1488 5748 thou 4771 the Christ 5547, the Son 5207 of the Blessed 2128? 

14:62 And 1161 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627, I 1473 am 1510 5748: and 2532 ye shall see 3700 5695 the Son 5207 of man 444 sitting 2521 5740 on 1537 the right hand 1188 of power 1411, and 2532 coming 2064 5740 in 3326 the clouds 3507 of heaven 3772. 

14:63 Then 1161 the high priest 749 rent 1284 5660 his 848 clothes 5509, and saith 3004 5719, What 5101 need 5532 we 2192 5719 any further 2089 witnesses 3144? 

14:64 Ye have heard 191 5656 the blasphemy 988: what 5101 think 5316 5727 ye 5213? And 1161 they all 3956 condemned 2632 5656 him 846 to be 1511 5750 guilty 1777 of death 2288. 

14:65 And 2532 some 5100 began 756 5662 to spit 1716 5721 on him 846, and 2532 to cover 4028 5721 his 846 face 4383, and 2532 to buffet 2852 5721 him 846, and 2532 to say 3004 5721 unto him 846, Prophesy 4395 5657: and 2532 the servants 5257 did strike 906 5707 him 846 with the palms of their hands 4475. 

14:66 And 2532 as Peter 4074 was 5607 5752 beneath 2736 in 1722 the palace 833, there cometh 2064 5736 one 3391 of the maids 3814 of the high priest 749: 

14:67 And 2532 when she saw 1492 5631 Peter 4074 warming himself 2328 5734, she looked 1689 5660 upon him 846, and said 3004 5719, And 2532 0 thou 4771 also 2532 wast 2258 5713 with 3326 Jesus 2424 of Nazareth 3479. 

14:68 But 1161 he denied 720 5662, saying 3004 5723, I know 1492 5758 not 3756, neither 3761 understand I 1987 5736 what 5101 thou 4771 sayest 3004 5719. And 2532 he went 1831 5627 out 1854 into 1519 the porch 4259; and 2532 the cock 220 crew 5455 5656. 

14:69 And 2532 a maid 3814 saw 1492 5631 him 846 again 3825, and began 756 5662 to say 3004 5721 to them that stood by 3936 5761, This 3754 3778 is 2076 5748 [one] of 1537 them 846. 

14:70 And 1161 he denied it 720 5711 again 3825. And 2532 a little 3397 after 3326, they that stood by 3936 5761 said 3004 5707 again 3825 to Peter 4074, Surely 230 thou art 1488 5748 [one] of 1537 them 846: for 2532 1063 thou art 1488 5748 a Galilaean 1057, and 2532 thy 4675 speech 2981 agreeth 3662 5719 [thereto]. 

14:71 But 1161 he began 756 5662 to curse 332 5721 and 2532 to swear 3660 5721, [saying], I know 3754 1492 5758 not 3756 this 5126 man 444 of whom 3739 ye speak 3004 5719. 

14:72 And 2532 the 1537 second time 1208 the cock 220 crew 5455 5656. And 2532 Peter 4074 called to mind 363 5681 the word 4487 that 3739 Jesus 2424 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, 3754 Before 4250 the cock 220 crow 5455 5658 twice 1364, thou shalt deny 533 5695 me 3165 thrice 5151. And 2532 when he thought thereon 1911 5631, he wept 2799 5707. 

15:1 And 2532 straightway 2112 in 1909 the morning 4404 the chief priests 749 held 4160 5660 a consultation 4824 with 3326 the elders 4245 and 2532 scribes 1122 and 2532 the whole 3650 council 4892, and bound 1210 5660 Jesus 2424, and carried [him] away 667 5656, and 2532 delivered 3860 5656 [him] to Pilate 4091. 

15:2 And 2532 Pilate 4091 asked 1905 5656 him 846, Art 1488 5748 thou 4771 the King 935 of the Jews 2453? And 1161 he answering 611 5679 said 2036 5627 unto him 846, Thou 4771 sayest 3004 5719 [it]. 

15:3 And 2532 the chief priests 749 accused 2723 5707 him 846 of many things 4183: but 1161 he answered 611 5662 nothing 3762. 

15:4 And 1161 Pilate 4091 asked 1905 5656 him 846 again 3825, saying 3004 5723, Answerest thou 611 5736 nothing 3756 3762? behold 2396 how many things 4214 they witness 2649 5719 against thee 4675. 

15:5 But 1161 Jesus 2424 yet 3765 answered 611 5662 nothing 3762; so 5620 that Pilate 4091 marvelled 2296 5721. 

15:6 Now 1161 at 2596 [that] feast 1859 he released 630 5707 unto them 846 one 1520 prisoner 1198, whomsoever 3746 4007 they desired 154 5710. 

15:7 And 1161 there was 2258 5713 [one] named 3004 5746 Barabbas 912, [which lay] bound 1210 5772 with 3326 them that had made insurrection with him 4955, who 3748 had committed 4160 5715 murder 5408 in 1722 the insurrection 4714. 

15:8 And 2532 the multitude 3793 crying aloud 310 5660 began 756 5662 to desire 154 5733 [him to do] as 2531 he had ever 104 done 4160 5707 unto them 846. 

15:9 But 1161 Pilate 4091 answered 611 5662 them 846, saying 3004 5723, Will ye 2309 5719 that I release 630 5661 unto you 5213 the King 935 of the Jews 2453? 

15:10 For 1063 he knew 1097 5707 that 3754 the chief priests 749 had delivered 3860 5715 him 846 for 1223 envy 5355. 

15:11 But 1161 the chief priests 749 moved 383 5656 the people 3793, that 2443 he should rather 3123 release 630 5661 Barabbas 912 unto them 846. 

15:12 And 1161 Pilate 4091 answered 611 5679 and said 2036 5627 again 3825 unto them 846, What 5101 will ye 2309 5719 then 3767 that I shall do 4160 5661 [unto him] whom 3739 ye call 3004 5719 the King 935 of the Jews 2453? 

15:13 And 1161 they cried out 2896 5656 again 3825, Crucify 4717 5657 him 846. 

15:14 Then 1161 Pilate 4091 said 3004 5707 unto them 846, Why 1063, what 5101 evil 2556 hath he done 4160 5656? And 1161 they cried out 2896 5656 the more exceedingly 4056, Crucify 4717 5657 him 846. 

15:15 And 1161 [so] Pilate 4091, willing 1014 5740 to content 2425 4160 5658 the people 3793, released 630 5656 Barabbas 912 unto them 846, and 2532 delivered 3860 5656 Jesus 2424, when he had scourged 5417 5660 [him], to 2443 be crucified 4717 5686. 

15:16 And 1161 the soldiers 4757 led 520 0 him 846 away 520 5627 into 2080 the hall 833, called 3603 2076 5748 Praetorium 4232; and 2532 they call together 4779 5719 the whole 3650 band 4686. 

15:17 And 2532 they clothed 1746 5719 him 846 with purple 4209, and 2532 platted 4120 5660 a crown 4735 of thorns 174, and put it about 4060 5719 his 846 [head], 

15:18 And 2532 began 756 5662 to salute 782 5738 him 846, Hail 5463 5720, King 935 of the Jews 2453! 

15:19 And 2532 they smote 5180 5707 him 846 on the head 2776 with a reed 2563, and 2532 did spit 1716 5707 upon him 846, and 2532 bowing 5087 5723 [their] knees 1119 worshipped 4352 5707 him 846. 

15:20 And 2532 when 3753 they had mocked 1702 5656 him 846, they took off 1562 5656 the purple 4209 from him 846, and 2532 put 1746 0 his own 2398 clothes 2440 on 1746 5656 him 846, and 2532 led 1806 0 him 846 out 1806 5719 to 2443 crucify 4717 5661 him 846. 

15:21 And 2532 they compel 29 5719 one 5100 Simon 4613 a Cyrenian 2956, who passed by 3855 5723, coming 2064 5740 out of 575 the country 68, the father 3962 of Alexander 223 and 2532 Rufus 4504, to 2443 bear 142 5661 his 846 cross 4716. 

15:22 And 2532 they bring 5342 5719 him 846 unto 1909 the place 5117 Golgotha 1115, which 3739 is 2076 5748, being interpreted 3177 5746, The place 5117 of a skull 2898. 

15:23 And 2532 they gave 1325 5707 him 846 to drink 4095 5629 wine 3631 mingled with myrrh 4669 5772: but 1161 he received 2983 5627 [it] not 3756. 

15:24 And 2532 when they had crucified 4717 5660 him 846, they parted 1266 5707 his 846 garments 2440, casting 906 5723 lots 2819 upon 1909 them 846, what 5101 every man 5101 should take 142 5661. 

15:25 And 1161 it was 2258 5713 the third 5154 hour 5610, and 2532 they crucified 4717 5656 him 846. 

15:26 And 2532 the superscription 1923 of his 846 accusation 156 was 2258 5713 written over 1924 5772, THE KING 935 OF THE JEWS 2453. 

15:27 And 2532 with 4862 him 846 they crucify 4717 5719 two 1417 thieves 3027; the one 1520 on 1537 his right hand 1188, and 2532 the other 1520 on 1537 his 846 left 2176. 

15:28 And 2532 the scripture 1124 was fulfilled 4137 5681, which 3588 saith 3004 5723, And 2532 he was numbered 3049 5681 with 3326 the transgressors 459. 

15:29 And 2532 they that passed by 3899 5740 railed 987 5707 on him 846, wagging 2795 5723 their 848 heads 2776, and 2532 saying 3004 5723, Ah 3758, thou that destroyest 2647 5723 the temple 3485, and 2532 buildest 3618 5723 [it] in 1722 three 5140 days 2250, 

15:30 Save 4982 5657 thyself 4572, and 2532 come down 2597 5628 from 575 the cross 4716. 

15:31 Likewise 1161 3668 also 2532 the chief priests 749 mocking 1702 5723 said 3004 5707 among 4314 themselves 240 with 3326 the scribes 1122, He saved 4982 5656 others 243; himself 1438 he cannot 3756 1410 5736 save 4982 5658. 

15:32 Let 2597 0 Christ 5547 the King 935 of Israel 2474 descend 2597 5628 now 3568 from 575 the cross 4716, that 2443 we may see 1492 5632 and 2532 believe 4100 5661. And 2532 they that were crucified 4957 5772 with him 846 reviled 3679 5707 him 846. 

15:33 And 1161 when 1096 0 the sixth 1623 hour 5610 was come 1096 5637, there was 1096 5633 darkness 4655 over 1909 the whole 3650 land 1093 until 2193 the ninth 1766 hour 5610. 

15:34 And 2532 at the ninth 1766 hour 5610 Jesus 2424 cried 994 5656 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, saying 3004 5723, Eloi 1682, Eloi 1682, lama 2982 sabachthani 4518? which 3739 is 2076 5748, being interpreted 3177 5746, My 3450 God 2316, my 3450 God 2316, why 5101 hast 1519 thou forsaken 1459 5627 me 3165? 

15:35 And 2532 some of them 5100 that stood by 3936 5761, when they heard 191 5660 [it], said 3004 5707, Behold 2400 5628, he calleth 5455 5719 Elias 2243. 

15:36 And 1161 one 1520 ran 5143 5631 and 2532 filled 1072 0 a spunge 4699 full 1072 5660 of vinegar 3690, and 5037 put [it] on 4060 5631 a reed 2563, and gave 4222 0 him 846 to drink 4222 5707, saying 3004 5723, Let alone 863 5628; let us see 1492 5632 whether 1487 Elias 2243 will come 2064 5736 to take 2507 0 him 846 down 2507 5629. 

15:37 And 1161 Jesus 2424 cried 863 5631 with a loud 3173 voice 5456, and gave up the ghost 1606 5656. 

15:38 And 2532 the veil 2665 of the temple 3485 was rent 4977 5681 in 1519 twain 1417 from 575 the top 509 to 2193 the bottom 2736. 

15:39 And 1161 when the centurion 2760, which 3588 stood 3936 5761 over 1537 against 1727 him 846, saw 1492 5631 that 3754 he so 3779 cried out 2896 5660, and gave up the ghost 1606 5656, he said 2036 5627, Truly 230 this 3778 man 444 was 2258 5713 the Son 5207 of God 2316. 

15:40 There 1161 were 2258 5713 also 2532 women 1135 looking 2334 5723 on afar 3113 off 575: among 2532 1722 whom 3739 was 2258 5713 Mary 3137 Magdalene 3094, and 2532 Mary 3137 the mother 3384 of James 2385 the less 3398 and 2532 of Joses 2500, and 2532 Salome 4539; 

15:41 (Who 3739 also 2532, when 3753 he was 2258 5713 in 1722 Galilee 1056, followed 190 5707 him 846, and 2532 ministered 1247 5707 unto him 846) and 2532 many 4183 other 243 women which 3588 came up 4872 5631 with him 846 unto 1519 Jerusalem 2414. 

15:42 And 2532 now 2235 when the even 3798 was come 1096 5637, because 1893 it was 2258 5713 the preparation 3904, that 3603 is 2076 5748, the day before the sabbath 4315, 

15:43 Joseph 2501 of 575 Arimathaea 707, an honourable 2158 counsellor 1010, which 3739 also 2532 waited 4327 5740 for 2258 5713 the kingdom 932 of God 2316, came 2064 5627, and went in 1525 5627 boldly 5111 5660 unto 4314 Pilate 4091, and 2532 craved 154 5668 the body 4983 of Jesus 2424. 

15:44 And 1161 Pilate 4091 marvelled 2296 5656 if 1487 he were 2348 0 already 2235 dead 2348 5758: and 2532 calling 4341 5666 [unto him] the centurion 2760, he asked 1905 5656 him 846 whether he had been 599 0 any while 3819 dead 599 5627. 

15:45 And 2532 when he knew 1097 5631 [it] of 575 the centurion 2760, he gave 1433 5662 the body 4983 to Joseph 2501. 

15:46 And 2532 he bought 59 5660 fine linen 4616, and 2532 took him down 2507 5631, and wrapped 1750 5656 him 846 in the linen 4616, and 2532 laid 2698 5656 him 846 in 1722 a sepulchre 3419 which 3739 was 2258 5713 hewn 2998 5772 out of 1537 a rock 4073, and 2532 rolled 4351 5656 a stone 3037 unto 1909 the door 2374 of the sepulchre 3419. 

15:47 And 1161 Mary 3137 Magdalene 3094 and 2532 Mary 3137 [the mother] of Joses 2500 beheld 2334 5707 where 4226 he was laid 5087 5743. 

16:1 And 2532 when 1230 0 the sabbath 4521 was past 1230 5637, Mary 3137 Magdalene 3094, and 2532 Mary 3137 the [mother] 3588 of James 2385, and 2532 Salome 4539, had bought 59 5656 sweet spices 759, that 2443 they might come 2064 5631 and anoint 218 5661 him 846. 

16:2 And 2532 very 3029 early in the morning 4404 the first 3391 [day] of the week 4521, they came 2064 5736 unto 1909 the sepulchre 3419 at the rising 393 5660 of the sun 2246. 

16:3 And 2532 they said 3004 5707 among 4314 themselves 1438, Who 5101 shall roll 617 0 us 2254 away 617 5692 the stone 3037 from 1537 the door 2374 of the sepulchre 3419? 

16:4 And 2532 when they looked 308 5660, they saw 2334 5719 that 3754 the stone 3037 was rolled away 617 5769: for 1063 it was 2258 5713 very 4970 great 3173. 

16:5 And 2532 entering 1525 5631 into 1519 the sepulchre 3419, they saw 1492 5627 a young man 3495 sitting 2521 5740 on 1722 the right side 1188, clothed 4016 5772 in a long white 3022 garment 4749; and 2532 they were affrighted 1568 5681. 

16:6 And 1161 he saith 3004 5719 unto them 846, Be 1568 0 not 3361 affrighted 1568 5744: Ye seek 2212 5719 Jesus 2424 of Nazareth 3479, which 3588 was crucified 4717 5772: he is risen 1453 5681; he is 2076 5748 not 3756 here 5602: behold 2396 the place 5117 where 3699 they laid 5087 5656 him 846. 

16:7 But 235 go your way 5217 5720, tell 2036 5628 his 846 disciples 3101 and 2532 Peter 4074 that 3754 he goeth before 4254 5719 you 5209 into 1519 Galilee 1056: there 1563 shall ye see 3700 5695 him 846, as 2531 he said 2036 5627 unto you 5213. 

16:8 And 2532 they went out 1831 5631 quickly 5035, and fled 5343 5627 from 575 the sepulchre 3419; for 1161 they trembled 2192 5707 5156 and 2532 were amazed 1611: neither 2532 said they 2036 5627 any thing 3762 to any 3762 [man]; for 1063 they were afraid 5399 5711. 

16:9 Now 1161 when [Jesus] was risen 450 5631 early 4404 the first 4413 [day] of the week 4521, he appeared 5316 5648 first 4412 to Mary 3137 Magdalene 3094, out of 575 whom 3739 he had cast 1544 5715 seven 2033 devils 1140. 

16:10 [And] she 1565 went 4198 5679 and told 518 5656 them that had been 1096 5637 with 3326 him 846, as they mourned 3996 5723 and 2532 wept 2799 5723. 

16:11 And they 2548, when they had heard 191 5660 that 3754 he was alive 2198 5719, and 2532 had been seen 2300 5681 of 5259 her 846, believed not 569 5656. 

16:12 After 1161 3326 that 5023 he appeared 5319 5681 in 1722 another 2087 form 3444 unto two 1417 of 1537 them 846, as they walked 4043 5723, and went 4198 5740 into 1519 the country 68. 

16:13 And they 2548 went 565 5631 and told 518 5656 [it] unto the residue 3062: neither 3761 believed they 4100 5656 them 1565. 

16:14 Afterward 5305 he appeared 5319 5681 unto the eleven 1733 as they 846 sat at meat 345 5740, and 2532 upbraided 3679 5656 them with their 846 unbelief 570 and 2532 hardness of heart 4641, because 3754 they believed 4100 5656 not 3756 them which had seen 2300 5666 him 846 after he was risen 1453 5772. 

16:15 And 2532 he said 2036 5627 unto them 846, Go ye 4198 5679 into 1519 all 537 the world 2889, and preach 2784 5657 the gospel 2098 to every 3956 creature 2937. 

16:16 He that believeth 4100 5660 and 2532 is baptized 907 5685 shall be saved 4982 5701; but 1161 he that believeth not 569 5660 shall be damned 2632 5701. 

16:17 And 1161 these 5023 signs 4592 shall follow 3877 5692 them that believe 4100 5660; In 1722 my 3450 name 3686 shall they cast out 1544 5692 devils 1140; they shall speak 2980 5692 with new 2537 tongues 1100; 

16:18 They shall take up 142 5692 serpents 3789; and if 2579 they drink 4095 5632 any 5100 0 deadly 2286 thing 5100, it shall not 3364 hurt 984 5692 them 846; they shall lay 2007 5692 hands 5495 on 1909 the sick 732, and 2532 they shall 2192 5692 recover 2573. 

16:19 So 3303 then 3767 after 3326 the Lord 2962 had spoken 2980 5658 unto them 846, he was received up 353 5681 into 1519 heaven 3772, and 2532 sat 2523 5656 on 1537 the right hand 1188 of God 2316. 

16:20 And 1161 they 1565 went forth 1831 5631, and preached 2784 5656 every where 3837, the Lord 2962 working with 4903 5723 [them], and 2532 confirming 950 5723 the word 3056 with 1223 signs 4592 following 1872 5723. Amen 281.
